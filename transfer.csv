"Official: Olympique Lyonnais have been handed a provisional relegation to Ligue 2. This also includes a transfer BAN due to their financial situation. ","2024-11-15T19:22:50+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gs4dt1/official_olympique_lyonnais_have_been_handed_a/","[No textual content]","6240","shubh03","https://neunzigplus.de/ligue-1/lyon-transfer-sperre/","So they're gonna have to sell half their squad in winter to avoid being relegated. That's brutal What? How in the actual fuck is this possible  7 in a row champions in the 2000s to this. Absolutely brutal, fuck Textor though Shameful, criminal mismanagement. Fucking hell this is madness.   How can clubs of this stature be so poorly run This is partially due to the TV rights deal as well as their own financial situation.  Not being able to get proper Ligue 1 media rights deals has been a disaster Uffff, how have they fallen, the last owner seems to have sold at the time. Used to be a giant and to this. Wow didn't see this coming 15 years ago >In a recent press release, OL presented a financial debt of €505.1 million and expressed the doubts of its auditors considering ""issuing an impossibility of certifying the social and consolidated accounts of Eagle Football Group"".  [https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/L-ol-interdit-de-recrutement-cet-hiver-et-retrograde-a-titre-conservatoire-en-fin-de-saison-par-la-dncg/1520558](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/L-ol-interdit-de-recrutement-cet-hiver-et-retrograde-a-titre-conservatoire-en-fin-de-saison-par-la-dncg/1520558)  When the auditors can't certify your accounts you are finished. Wow, this feels like a blindside. Didn't know they were in financial trouble until stumbling on the news on Instagram posted by Fabrizio. This feels like it should be bigger news? This is really, really bad for Ligue 1. Any possibility of becoming the next Bordeaux or a problem they have the capacity to overcome? You'll come back stronger, trust me bro. Wow.  Bordeaux and Lyon in the space of a year....   French club football really is standing on the edge of a knife here. Do relegation clauses in contracts automatically trigger in the case of provisional relegation? What does this imply for the women's team?  They have one of the top teams in women's football I'm curious what this means for Thiago Almada. We sold him to the Eagles Football Group who owns OL and Botafogo. The goal was for him to play 6 months in Brazil and then move to OL. Wonder what happens now. Jesus, this is huge. Such a historic club too Reminder that Textor sold 250m€ worth of club assets in the past 18 months to somehow end up with more debt than we had we he arrived 2 years ago. This man is a crook. Kinda fucked up Lyon, Everton and others have gotten punishment for stuff like this but City with 113 charges have gotten nothing yet. Absolutely ridiculous. The hell is the ownership doing? What the hell, man? Man city next please! Is it going to affect the women’s team as well? Because that would be a damn shame New FM save just dropped Damn. They were huge in mid 2000’s. Like among Europe’s best. Their player should hold enough value to be at able to see a good bit of their debt gone, but it’s a bad position to be in I feel bad for you OL fans, this could’ve been Milan so easily as well. I hope they turn it around I'd like to purchase one Argentinian leftback I cannot wait for Textor to get out of my club. The guy is a loose cannon.   I feel for the Lyon fans who have this clown in control Honey, new FM25 save just dropped This is the second French team in a short space of time with serious financial issues, Bordeaux was recently relegated multiple divisions due to their mismanagement of finances.  Something needs to be done to stop this from happening more teams. Does that mean we can have Mikautadze back again? I watched french leage in the early 2000s and they were invinciblw. I think 7 in a row. Like bayern the last few years. This development is a shocking fall from grace Rip Benny Oh Saïd Benrahma PSG winning for the next decade. What does this mean? A provisional relegation? Really sad and really messed up from the ownership... I remember lyon squad being the absolute unit behind those champions League fixtures.. A real sad day to see this club in dire.. you got any decent attackers? we desperately need some How will this affect the women’s team? Is cherki still there? 👀 Not Lyon... Too bad it happen to them, i remember their team in late 2000's that beat Madrid in CL knockout round Damn. If there is one team from Ligue 1 i didn't want to see getting relegated it's Lyon :|. One of us, one of us… Does that mean one extra ligue 2 team would be promoted or one less ligue 1 team would be demoted? How does this work?  Provision relegation, means they are set to start next season in L2 regardless of results? or They will play against L2 teams after international break?  Damn bonkers. Darn, another Girondins de Bordeaux in the making… 😵😱 HOJE TEM JOGO  DO BOTAFOGO  DO GLORIOSO  É   MEU GRANDE AMOR So is the relegation confirmed or is there anything to save them? WTF Rangers free win please Jesus Never forget 7-12-2011 What a bad thing to happen to such a club. Management failed it Shame. I always rated them, but wouldn't mind Perri and Cherki. How will that affect their (very successful [right?]) women‘s section - will it at all? Hello Sainté fans are salivating right now it's baffling how terrible Textor is at this multi-club thing, he managed to pump one team to fulfill his ego but feels all the other teams he owns only used to play poker of football players Getting relegated should really help their financial situation Do city next Shame this is happening at such a big club Textor blaming Nasser for lyon's 500m debts and all the fraudulent transfers he made between all the club he owns. Guys like him and Lopez should be in jail. Also Matic to City? Just to cover Rodi spot? sounds like a lifebuoy for Pep Now hand one to City Please let this happen to Citeh. I will taken 1 Jordan Veretout please! Wait, what?! A January auction coming up I feel for the fans. Hopefully they can sell a load of players, and get hit with a point deduction and avoid relegation.  i saw this news, but wait how??? will they be relegated or they'll be required to pay fine. someone pls clarify. thanks From seeing them be one of france’s best teams  at one point to being relegated. What the hell. Which are their best players? Cherki?  provisional? One of us, one of us… Huh?!?!??!?? What does provisional mean? So that's a no on buying Zaha I assume? OK, so last winter they were bottom of the table, bought a lot of players to avoid relegation and stormed up the table in the second half of the season.  This winter, they're top five and may have to sell players to avoid relegation, and they'll roll down the table in the second half of the season.  Up and down I saw this on TikTok and thought it was fake. Holy shit What the fuck? Wow There’s been nothing but drama since Textor took over. We had an awful winter market, & he somehow has a worse one over the summer. He doesn’t know what he’s doing and because of that we’re in this situation. This club use to be so good at producing and selling on talent/players. Shame to see this club being run so bad. Time to sign a few players 😈 Atlanta sold Thiago almada to botafogo with the caveat he would join Lyon in January. Feel super bad for him as he by far earned the move to Europe in Atlanta with his solo play and then double earned it by helping botafogo reach copa liberatadores final. Hope it works out for him in the end. Really quite a pickle. And Lyon have quite a few quality and also young up and coming players such as Fofana. Couldn't PSG in a gentleman agreement buy some players again for a lot of money as they usually do? /s  I was quite disappointed in the squad early on until they turned it around and now they have again become the Lyon you enjoy watching internationally. Would be quite a shame to have them be force relegated to Ligue 2. Ryan Cherki on sale #hmmmmmm Eagle group just completly destroyed the club. Babe wake up, new FM save just dropped Next is Manchester City! They used to be the Bayern/PSG of Ligue 1 when I was growing up. Winning the title year in year out.  What a shame man. I need to give a re watch to some of those ""what on earth is going on at -french club-"" from YT Deserved .  Would be hilarious if that helps Saint-Étienne staying in L1 Shame we have a some what decent defence atm, would have loved to get Tagliafico back 387 comments, no substantial critique on the root problems behind this: multi club ownership, private club ownership by persons w/o any connection to the club and the league being a clown show because of PSG. So sad, I always liked Lyon as a kid, I remember when they steamrolled the league and won like 6 is a row. I remember players like Benzema, Essien, Juninho and Ben Arfa.   What a total shit show now :(  Hope the club returns to it’s former glory soon. John Textor nearly bought Everton.   Now, the Friedkin group have their issues. But we have definitely dodged a bullet here. Let's go to Bordeaux, guys, ciao Textors Brazilian team are currently top of the Campeonato and in the Libertadores final. Palace ain't doing too roughly either. Can't throw all the blame on Textor here. Exactly what happened to Barcelona... Oh wait nothing happened to that disgusting club even when they were broke af and when the bribed refs lmao France needs to use their diplomatic influence to get more foreign investors to at least protect their most prized assets (Lyon, Marseille, Lille). PSG cheated for years I don't get how PSG managed to buy all the players they did in the past and not also incure massive debts as well. I would've said the owners paid off any debt, but then my question is why can't Textor or any other investors pay off the debt that is leading to Lyon's relegation? Wtf.  They've been in trouble for a while but I genuinely thought they had turned things around. Lmao Well, karma for ndombele Man, French League is a banter league. How do you have so many financial issues? League butchered it and now clubs are. BAN And the fact that they NEED to sell will drop the prices quite a bit. And they're in 5th too right now! 😢 It even might not be enough Their total squad value is only 240m euros as per transfermarkt   I can’t exactly see teams lining up to overspend on most of these players  And of course transfermarkt isn’t the end all, be all of value, but as some form of valuation, yikes. Few thoughts reading this news.   - Brutal for the fans. Once again the victims are those that had no say in how things were done.   - I worry this won't be the last time we see a big French club hit the wall trying to keep pace with the top teams.   -After Cherki I'm trying to figure out who the big departures are here.  - Very niche, but fuck me if this isn't crap luck for Tanner Tessmann. Well at least they have a chance to end up better than Bordeaux? This must've been expected, can't be out of nowhere? The took Niakhate off forest (3rd/4th choice CB) for 30m - Barely makes an appearance for em - something definitely weird going off. I wouldnt buy anything and let the club drown to get the players for free in six months. They own the stadium so they could potentially leverage that equity. Can they pull up Barca's lever strategy? :) We can get NDombele and Auorur... however you spell it, for cheap!  What year is it? Textor disator class To be fair Ligue 1 teams bankrupts weren't impossible, given half of them risked it at the start of the season did the tv deal fiasco wreck them that bad? it can't possibly have been THIS much of a difference Gerard Lopez and John Textor shaking their hands together. Imo glad to see it. Shitty practices made sure the biggest incoming transfer to belgium never played a minute at the club just so Lyon could loan him and buy a year later after the Belgium club got relegated with a Textor owned coach. Fuck Lyon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgohcV8OwkU (video in French).  Basically Eagle group or whatever they are called is a ponzi scheme. And Everton too while we're at it just because. Knew something was off when Lyon spent 32m on Niakhate who was a bench warmer at Forest Wild mismanagement? It's not like everybody's been warning Lyon fans for a year. Why does he seem to care so much about Botafogo, yet leave Lyons out to die? Palace fans will chat a lot of shit about parish, but the reason he refuses to give up his controlling shares is exactly because of this, he loves the club and while he probably doesn’t really know what we need to do in order to push forwards, he will fight till his last breath to keep this from happening to us I guess Qatar didn't help. Ils sont fucked Us (Schalke) will be next welcome to Ligue 1 Because the French League fucked with TV rights several times in a row. Teams earn half of what they had 5 years ago. OL was very well run, this is why it was valued 500M€ but John Fucking Textor managed to run it into the ground in 2 years. Insane.  Time to bring out the Guillotine !! No, this is Sparta 100% Labrune destroying French football while tripling his salary.   How tf did he get reelected \> Not being able to get proper Ligue 1 media rights deals has been a disaster  I think the current Dazn deal is still over valued and they'll get out when they can in two years.  Not many people care about Ligue 1. Another Aulas masterclass They had a very good streak in the early 00s and won their only 7 titles in a row yeah, but used to be a giant ? Lmao saying this just proves you started watching football in the late 00s Well, this verdict did come out only half an hour ago... As it stands probably not, unlike us they have assets still, and behind Textor is a massive investment fund which should limit the damage (ie no loss of professional status). But that is only as long as textor does not try to get rid of them, or they do not try to get rid of the club if it falls back in their hands (like fortress did to us at the time, which gave the keys to Lopez) So sad what happened to Bordeaux.  I went on trial there when I was 14 and thought it was a beautiful city. According to Romain Molina, we shouldn't go down as quickly as Bordeaux did because ownership would switch from Textor to capital fund Ares if he missed payment, protecting us in some ways.   However, this fund apparently isn't willing to actually own a club, so it's likely they'd go for a drastic cost reduction tactic with no thought given to the sporting side, which is already pretty bad. One of us! One of us! Ngl going bankrupt in way better than what you did Juve merda This is partly due to the shady management of the LFP (professional football league), whose CEO Vincent Labrune is poorly running. Ironically, Text or was one of the few club's presidents to oppose Labrune Doubt Lyon players have relegation clauses They shouldn't, unless Lyon were to get officially relegated mid season Textor already sold half of it when he bought the club He's getting sold to cover the debts Hopefuly he'll stay in Botafogo. Aye Thiago almada what a fucking player he is (I've only ever seen him in my fm save) ig every fm player would be sad by this news. Follow the money all the way to Bofatogo. This is criminal (probably deliberate) mismanagement Well, that is what having a sugar daddy with unlimited money does for you, you can add PSG to the list too. Very different cases. City aren't 500m in debt. I mean their case is still ongoing(though let's not kid ourselves they will get away with a slap on the wrist and a stern ""you shouldn't have done that"" warning) Different cases will take different lengths of time are the accusation similars in term of severity and how easy it is to prove them though ?   (am really waiting for city to fall but at this rate it seems like nothing is concrete) If only a new FM dropped They were in a champions league semi-final 5 years ago But whose gonna pay good prices now? Teams know they have to sell and will low ball the offers. we got one argentinian left back at home Let’s see if FM25 ever drops FM26, you might get to play it around 2028 at this rate. I think in this case it was because of the shenanigans with their broadcast deal being pulled and having to accept less He seems really to be made for you guys You know how teams that win cups are shown on the table as already qualified for europe? Same principle.  They have to remedy this in a few months, or they're taking up a relegation spot no matter where they finish [deleted] Yes, he signed a new contract Cherki to Botafogo for 500M, here we go! Not for long... Textor LENDA ANTICOLONIALISTA, roubando dinheiro da Europa e aplicando tudo no fogão I'd be worried about this if I were you. Pay off their debts I guess you’re referring to the win over Zagreb fucking Ajax over ? Can't wait for the bottlers to bottle another league title like Arsenal is used to doing. He's been absolute shit.  You guys did very well to trick Textor into wasting money on the loan and paying half his wages. Textor sold most of our assets and transferred the funds to afford Botafogo Palace fan here, I want him out! They let Bordeaux wither on the vine... I don't know what the financial rules are exactly over in France regarding owners injecting cash, but while Textor is (obviously) rich, he's also majorly over leveraged.   He's relied heavily on loans to finance most of the football clubs he's acquired, and is very much relying on Eagle Football groups eventual planned IPO. Debt isn't a problem if you can afford to pay it back, the ligue 1 DNCG doesn't care about how much you spend it's not financial fair play, they just care about the stability of your club so it doesn't spiral into a complete mess. PSG have virtually unlimited funds with QSI, they can spend as much as they want as far as our instances are concerned, they'll always be able to balance the accounts whenever they want. > is why can't Textor  Because Textor isn't that rich. He's not even a billionaire, most of what he owns is crippled with debts. 6 words: PSG is owned by a state Nah this has to be ironic Probably by more than just a bit. I wouldn’t be surprised if players will request to leave either Rich clubs are probably looking at Lyon's squad list right now as if they are reading a menu. Almost every top club is gonna be after Cherki  and Lyon are gonna lose him for peanuts. This is sad I mean spending a shitload of money is the reason for the ban, so they should be high. 5th should be a massive underachievement They are -100M in transfer spendings this season alone. It's not like they(I mean the board ofc) didn't deserve this. One tier drop is kinda merciful in their case. There are only four points between the podium (OM at 20 points) and the middle of the table (Auxerre at 16 points). We are at a third of the year only, and Lyon still has a decent chance to reach UCL places. Is the reported debt of 500 million accurate? Because if so I can’t see you getting half of that if you sell your entire senior team no disrespect That's what happens when you overpay for players you don't need. The fact that he spent 147M € on incoming transfers when the club is already in financial trouble and he's selling all assets to pay off debts is unbelievable. It's shocking this man has any money left to his name > I worry this won't be the last time we see a big French club hit the wall trying to keep pace with the top teams.   We saw Strasbourg go down some time ago, Bordeaux recently, Toulouse wasn't very well five years ago... So yeah, shit happens frequently. The LFP tv rights scandals will definitely hurt those who didn't prepare for this. A lot of good clubs are quietly keeping their books healthy and are happy to remain out of the top of the table. When you want to burn money to reach the top, you are only sure about the ""burning money"" part. A friendly reminder to all Everton fans that this dude wanted to buy Everton and according to some rumours, was actually somewhat close before Friedkin stepped in. He's such a moron. He actually came out of the meeting with the instances today and said to the press that it went very well lol  Also a reminder that the first time Lyon had been sanctionned was, and this is not a joke, because when he took over, the previous president sent him the Ligue 1 list of provisitional sanctions and Textor ""didn't open the attachment because the email sounded positive"".  Yup, this is a millionaire entrepreneur who doesn't look at crucial financial information because he misread the tone. Good luck Lyon friends, you're in for a ride. thank God we rejected his attemps to get his hands into benfica I'll never not think of the time traveller Titor when Textor is mentioned l, my brain is broken. He still has Botofogo which are very likely to get the South American double. It's not all lost for him According to L'Equipe, Auxerre, Lens, Nantes, Stade Reims, Montpellier, Brest, Le Havre and Angers are all at risk of going bankrupt because of the shortage of funds  I got this from an ESPN article Okay, I missed something. What happened that fucked the Ligue 1 teams over like this? Instead of 1b€ split between the teams, it went down to less than 500m€ It affects more clubs than you think  Any Team that was ambitious to try to get funds and leverage them against the amounts paid by the initial TV deal got screwed Normally that would be considered a relay transfer and should have both clubs banned from buying any player for a full season Niakhate wasn’t a bench warmer at Forest.  He was a starter who had some bad luck with injuries.      32m was still definitely too much though! because Botafogo is actually doing well with less money spent. They’re in the Libertadores final and in first place in the league The reason is tricky. If Textor fails to run these clubs, the company that loaned the money (ARES) to buy them, gets the clubs as ""payback/garantee""... EXCEPT BOTAFOGO.   But why? Because the CEO of Botafogo Thairo Arruda (Textor friend) is actually the one owning it through OL companies in Brazil. So basically, OL paid for Botafogo for Arruda and Textor to get the club. And if things go south everywhere, they get to keep it anyway, while OL, Moleenbeck, etc all go to ARES. So Botafogo has to work because it's basically his club for real, not some club that he can lose.  I mean, it's even more complicated than that and super tricky somehow, and I'm lost trying to understand how bad he fucked us and ruined the clubs and the great assets we had to sold (OL women team, new LDLC Arena next to the stadium, etc). He was even asked about this at the start of season press conference, he said it's because his project with Botafogo started from scratch so he's more emotionally attached to them. I don't really know what that means because after two years at OL, he's shown that there's no way he's responsible for any of Botafogo's success Maybe brazillians are more likeable than french c'est la turbo merde Ils sont fucked*s*. Adjective needs to agree. *sad baguette noises* *two* *where clubs are better managed than in most other leagues but actually get punished when they fuck up (as opposed to... in most other leagues). To add some context.   Ligue 1 struggled to get any TV deals until Summer _this year_.   They fucked over Canal+, who held the rights for years prior to deal with MediaPro for 800m which ended up getting bust during the first months of COVID. After which, they only managed 600m (split between BeIN and Amazon).   That deal lasted four years and last year, last year they open offers at 1b and much to their surprise got none.  DAZN then swooped in with a 400m deal last minute, which they didn’t accept originally. At the time the president of Reims, which is a board representative for Ligue 1, literally said they wouldn’t mind missing a few games at the start of the season lol. Name checks out The french Tebas. Yeah Messi Mbappe and Neymar was most of the appeal and none of them are there now. Out of the loop here. I know Jean-Michou Aulas retired/sold the club but did he mismanage it toward the end? >7 titles in a row  ..... guess that qualifies as a giant? Watching since the 2002 WC. Don't know what's wrong with my statement. They were the biggest club in France. It was more that it only had 1 comment for the first 30 minutes of the article being posted. Just surprising Did you beat the case? I would assume they're worked into contracts as standard practice, regardless of club stature. Don't forget that we weren't too far off relegation last season due to very poor sporting results.  Then we had a miracle run in early 2024 but I wouldn't be surprised if players have a relegation clause. I wonder where the 20M you spent on him came from Hey we may have to dissolve the club, but at least some club on the other side of the world we don't give a fuck about may get the Serie A and Libertadores double Sigh I wonder why they aren't Yeah man having an oil state has an owner will do that It’s frustrating how money makes people invincible from justice most of the time They are 500 in charges! Surely if they are found guilty that wont happen?? It has to at least be enough of a points reduction so they lose the league Damn. It only takes two teams to want the same player to get them in a bidding war. Just sell them to the other teams he owns where he's been getting the overpaid players from in the first place. It's like opening a new credit card to pay off your old credit card, it's foolproof I think Avíla died or something They won't have to pay all of it, just like 100+ million to show they're on the right track. FAZ O PIX TEXTOR You guessed right Quick to jump on my comment aren't we?  Must be real scared that the oil team are gonna get what's coming to them!  🤣🤣🤣 Such a shame, because he can actually still be good if he just accepts that he is  adifferent player now without his explosiveness.  Hopefully we can send him to some English cluba next year. Really? Would love to see some proof of that Love that. Big fan of that. sucks to suck buddy The regional government torpedoed a sale to FSG It is. I'm sorry. Do they have a competent left winger? More like during Black Friday ""Yeah I'll have a Lacazette and an Alvero, perhaps with a Lepenant and Silva on the side?""  ""Alright, that'll be 20 million euros. Cash or card?"" Sooo, we are looking for defenders… 👀 Maybe they’ll consult Luis Suarez as well, seems like he’s got a bunch of free time on his hands right now. Real Madrid is looking for defensive position players.  I'm sure if anyone catches their eyes, they will pounce in acquiring them this winter. Begging someone to give Tagliafico a good home 😁😂 😁😂 😁😂 If almost every top club is going after him, they still have to bid against each other. It’s the players that only have one or two clubs interested in them that Lyon will get bent over in negotiations. It's spending a shitload of money in relation to their income, right? I'm not sure what the total money spent on transfers is across the league, but Lyon could very well still have spent the 5th most on transfers but had the highest ration of money spent:money grossed. Meanwhile PSG be like :) 100% misleading. The transfer balance of -100 is not “this season alone” as if this is a consistent thing, it’s the ONLY season where we have a negative transfer balance.   So that’s cherry-picking data at best and Lyon was not spending beyond its means.   Over the last 5 years, transfer spendings/earnings are positive +50M€.  https://www.transfermarkt.com/ligue-1/fuenfjahresvergleich/wettbewerb/FR1  Not saying that 100M€ was smart, or adequately spent. We overpaid a few players… but we got played by Textor.  Edit : +50 not +60 Textor sold 270M in Lyon's assets, so I wouldn't say they deserve it.  Theoretically, Textor should've had plenty of funds to cover a spending increase, but he's been screwing around with the money paying off debts and using it for other clubs. HAD a decent chance.  I might even say they were a favorite to finish top 4 with the way Cherki transformed the team. If it's 500 million, they will probably need to sell their stadium. As I understand it, the 500 mio debt is the combined finances of all clubs that belong to the multi club system (don't remember the name). You don’t have to fully clear the debt you just need to keep it under a specific threshold. Every club (and every company) has some debt, it’s only a problem when it’s too much relative to your operating income. 505 exactly, but we need to bring enough in the club to show we are getting healthier, we're waiting on the exact numbers, some talks about between 100 and 200 Mil to not be relegated. Textor got Botafogo where they are thanks to our club and now wants Botafogo to help us. I almost forgot the mandatory fuck Textor. Who is exactly saying that to avoid relegation they need to immediately erase all their debt. I don't get this part.  The source only says they need to ""improve their condition"", and from what I was generally reading in media, it (and even evading double relegation) would require a massive amount of money, but nothing about why they'd have to immediately pay off 500 million. from what I heard, they only need to sell 100 million in the January transfer window to not be relegated. pretty much just need to show that they can pay off the rest of the debt. (take this information with a grain of salt, im not well informed) Understatement - Us Nottingham  lads went out on the piss after you signed Niakhate for 30m and saved our club from any further FFP issues. He was below a 34 year old Willy Boly in our pecking order - insane money > It's shocking this man has any money left to his name  It's not in his name, he's just adding debt on the club, and when the club is dead and buried he will move on and be like ""oh well, it's just business amirite"". And then he will probably be allowed to buy another club or two. It also feels like, to an outsider, that the ripple effect of PSG is killing French football.   There are enough charts to show the financial disparity, and while Lille and Monaco will provide the occasional shot across the bow, I sense it will only become rarer. Lille was not in a good spot financially as well up until very recently Out of the frying pan and into the.. endless cycle of uncoordinated mess again then I guess. We don’t need a reminder mate, we all remember cause we were shitting ourselves.  He also showed interest in buying a large stake in Benfica. The rumor is that he wanted to buy Everton and make an insane offer to hire Abel Ferreira from Palmeiras as coach to make things easier for Botafogo in Brazil. I don't know what Botafogo did to this man. Is this dude Aulas? O he left before this mess? Pretty sure Textor is worth billions.  But yeah, he's a great illustration of the fact that billionaires are not some sort of collection of geniuses, plenty of them are complete morons.  What is true is that there are basically no billionaires who didn't have at least some support from their parents (either in funding or having a location to set up their company, garage/basement etc).  And that's definitely the case for Textor, who is part of the extended du Point family and was able to buy a company in 1996 aged 31 without really having done anything that could possible have provided him with the funds to do so (at least as far as I can find). we who? he wanted to buy stakes from a private shareholder, there was nothing the fans or club could do about it, he would still be a minority owner but still.   he got lucky that’s all That ill-conceived mediapro deal fucking a lot of teams not named PSG Vincent Labrune definitely has a lot to do with this My goodness, this league is managed by absolute morons. All Ligue 1 clubs really need to work together to create a better profit sharing mechanism, especially PSG. Instead of letting the rest of the league die while focusing solely on the CL, it'd be nice if PSG could use their financial clout to help the league as a whole. And they voted to keep Labrune.   Absolute clowns. good, the bubble must burst at some point, hopefully PL is next Absurd TV deals with MediaPro and now DAZN. Over paying the league rights and then cutting their loss mid-season leaving the clubs with only a fraction of what was promised. He was 100% a bench warmer. In the 22/23 season, he started 14 out of Forest's 45 matches. In the 23/24 season,  he started 17 out of 44 matches. Those are bench warmer numbers. He was injured a lot in 22/23, but he was fit the whole season in 23/24 and still rode the bench. This is not true. You could read the complete contract between Botafogo and John Textor, just use a translation tool. He had to show guarantees and invest money before becoming the owner of Botafogo SAF and before acquiring OL. The only money he used in Botafogo that originated from OL was for players who would eventually transfer to OL. Some players have already moved from Botafogo to OL at minimal cost.  The problem with OL was the television deal. He was expecting significantly more money from it, like almost all other clubs. Lyon was sold due to the detrimental influence of the PSG-BeIN-Qatar connection on French football. Textor was expecting that OL would qualify for the Champions League next year and could potentially transfer the top three Botafogo players, who also represent their national teams, to Lyon for free in 2025.  https://static.botafogo.com.br/upload/downloads/1444e9c362ab4a3ca753967fcfb1a8c6.pdf Oh no, he's definitely responsible for what Botafogo has been doing. Seriously, the last time they were a relevant force in Brazil was during the Seedorf years (2012-13). He made a lot of investments on their squad and managerial structure, Botafogo was in absolute disarray before his arrival. Maybe Real and true Idk French but I'll assume it's something about speedunning to be shite. I'm italian and I don't like this  And when italians have compassion towards french, you know something's wrong deux Touché i get the joke but i was referring to the situation that multiple other clubs currently face the possibility of the same scenario He might be worse lmao As much as I hate him, his rules prevent clubs from being over ambitious and try to risk going all in one season to get success and end up like this  The way the league is now prevents another La Coruña from happening Nah he’s way worst. Labrune might actually manage to completely bankrupt a bunch of ligue 1 clubs. He’s destroying the league Ligue 1 TV rights on average were (much) higher in the 2000s than in the 2020s.  This has more to do with mismanagement than with losing bankable stars. They were far from doing good on the financial and sporting side during the last few years of Aulas Aulas had a great vision for the club, and his overall strategy over the years was very sound; Essentially, he wanted to create and secure revenue streams that could be as decorrelated as much as possible from sporting results, while he both wanted to maximise what we had and be at the forefront on some new rising topics (i.e. women football). So he decided to build a big stadium which would be totally owned by the club (the first in France, other clubs rent their stadiums) and could be used not only for football but also for other things (e.g. concerts), he focused on the academy, built the arena, controlled communication on social networks, investment in a women team in the US to break into the US, sales of some shares to IDG to court the chinese market....  Unfortunately, his management of the sporting side (i.e. players and coach recruitment mainly) was very lacking this decade and those cracks eventually showed   The people he picked to manage the sporting side couldn't make it work; ultimately very few players we recruited over the decade ended up being success stories (the opposite in fact, duds were way too frequent), and we've always been lacking a great coach who could maximise the squad we had. We managed to make do thanks to the academy, consistently qualifying for Europe, and, let's be honest, the other French clubs being mismanaged generally.   But as we had to finance the investment through debt, our available cash was smaller so recruitment errors were magnified, the timing of the arrival of QSG was a bit unfortunate, and then when covid and media pro hit, right when we had a terrible season leaving us out of Europe, things started to snowball into critical. We never could afford to not qualify for ucl for too long, let alone not qualify for Europe altogether, and bad results then beget bad results... By Aulas' last years, we failed to qualify for ucl for 2 or 3 years in a row which is quite simply a financial disaster.   In this difficult context, Idg and Pathe (two biggest stakeholders with Aulas) then stated they wanted out so they forced a sale of the club; but people aren't really lining up to buy ligue 1 clubs at great costs these days so we got Textor... If all you care about is trophies, maybe. But even then, they never won it before or since. Lmfao, that just shows how in a few years people will call Man City a giant and the biggest club in England, and then you’ll be me laughing at that statement Corrie was on. Unfortunately 50% of the users of the sub only follow the Premier League (and it's notable also by most of the discussions you can find), so I guess it makes sense got sentenced to supporting Fulham I was sent back home to my academy team, which was punishment enough. You don't add ""sober"" to your name for no reason... Dude here casually dropping he was the defendant in a criminal case before he could legally drive That would be prudent, but it would also give the player a little bit of leverage in contract negotiations. Demanding a relegation clause can be a bit of a red flag if the club consistently finishes upper table. Yup. They have had charges and hopefully get punished. SAUDI OIL MONEY GOES BRRRRRRR Not to mention their completely legit sponsorship deals. With that flair, you of all people should not be talking 💀 its a shame it can't save united from being a banter club Not really, I'm confident City will squash the 115 and this subreddit will not know what to do.  You think England wants to upset an entire country? I don't.  What's going to happen is Arsenal will still be the losers of the top 6 per usual. Yep, our 2nd most coveted prospect is a young LW who has stepped up this season, Malick Fofana. Voucher Code: RELEGATION ""ill have two number 9s, a number 9 large and one with speed, a number five, a number 7 with extra drip and a large goali."" That sounds like Mambo No.5 i think personal negotiations will be where the bidding is. lyon will just have to accept what Cherki wants They have the second highest wagebill in Ligue 1, second only to PSG. They also have the fifth most valuable roster (combined transfermarkt values), I actually thought they were in top3, or 4th, but I was mistaken.  But either way, they at worst (or at best, depending how you look at it), are slightly underperforming overall.  They were spending like the Champions League Ligue 1 club, when they are not one. essentially out spending massively what they could actually afford.  its a shame its come to this but weve seen it before with teams like say Portsmouth, Malaga etc who all massively overspent then kinda crumbled when they didnt quite hit the success they spent for.  you could argue this is why stuff like FFP is there to protect clubs long term from just disappearing due to mismanagement. cause imagine if it wasnt checked now with threats like this. they could have kept spending and then all of sudden just had to insolvency the entire club like we have seen before with Rangers in Scotland. And honestly it’s probably better for them to spend a season or two in Ligue 2 than to sell their stadium  > (don't remember the name).  IIRC it was something dumb like Eagle Football Group or something yeah, more specifically when the interest payments on that debt are too much compared to revenues/ebitda/ebit/income/… So if a company has a lot of debt but manages to pay very low interest on it, it’s still fine I’m sure Textor will get Botafogo to buy a couple of Lyon players for highly inflated sums. Or even sell one of Botafogo stars (Almada, Henrique, Jesus) for peanuts to Lyon where they can be sold for their actual market price. But don't worry! Textor assured us there was no one better he could get for that amount of money. It's not like there were three CBs all on the team that could've been kept instead... Well in this case it looks like you got out of the frying pan and narrowly missed out on being fired into the **sun**,  so I'd take that as a small victory. Tbf he looked great compared to 777. aulas sold out to these guys 2-3 years ago He's not worth billions, he's got connection with billionaires that invest in his firm.  It's not his money and it's investment money. The only thing he succeeded with Lyon as of today is to sell the club assets and feed his investment firm with cash.   The situation is not good at all. He may be asset rich and cash poor though, so fixing a problem quickly may not be that easy despite being a billionaire Even PSG gets impacted indirectly. It's not good to be in a dead league How are psg supposed to help 17 other teams ? \*Top 5 Euro Leagues are next When he was fit he started.   He just wasn’t often fit.      I’m a Forest fan and the fans considered him out first choice CB until Murillo came through.  After that he dropped below Murillo but when he was fit he was the second choice CB. The tv deal is bad but OL might had at best 50M more from a better deal, and they have 500M debt so it’s clearly not the only reason. Basically we had literally nothing to lose and if things ever go south we'll just go back to how things used to be for my entire life *me 2* He's a jackass but Tebas is actually competent at his job. Might be?    Lyon isn't even the first French club that has happened to recently.   Tebas can't keep his mouth closed but La Liga isn't operating this badly  Damn. Fuck me sideways. I don't know what to say here. It’s just a very, very unfortunate way to see your club fall into obscurity for such a… reason when financial mismanagement (sports was) wasn't necessarily the primary reason why your club might be relegated. A lot of Ligue1 clubs seem to not have any financial stability either. It’s fucking wild how Ligue1 is managed. Very wild. I actually think a club that averages 50k people in their stadium could qualify as a giant regardless of trophies won. Also, when they won their 7 league titles PSG had like two. Is PSG a giant? Corrie? So harsh, the poor guy was just a kid!   French justice is too drastic  Murderers get lesser punishments than that  How did life turn out for you? Did you end up leaving football? You mean emirati oil money How exactly?  Who can escape 115 charges?  Even in the best case scenario where Citeh accept some of the charges, it would still be enough to destroy the club.  You're boxed in with no way out. The shit thing is, he will be one of the first to go, while you have the most potential and probably a low amount of wage pressure with him... The disrespect to Duksch smh He could've screwed over the club this season by not renewing, but he did.  So I'd assume he'd work with the club a little bit to try and save it.  But for the non academy players (most of them), I doubt they give a crap what happens. Are the teams in front of them Marseille, Monaco and Lille? being in a situation, where you potentially can't pay the players doesn't do good things to perceived transfer values Agreed, the revenue drop would be immense. Their debt is not gonna go anywhere. But their income will be cut down substantially. 500mil debt will be 700mil in no time if they cant make the payments... With the dncg, even 90m in debt is enough to send the club to the french fifth division. They deserve bankruptcy for that name, smh its why its not an issue for say Man United  they have the revenue to keep that debt in check even with it being insane.  but when that revenue takes a hit like for Lyon over the years has on top of continuous poor spending you are in trouble. Almada is already expected to arrive in january, the thing is we can't buy any more player for the next transfer window, it's another sanction applied to the club, only free loans are allowed, even peanuts are too much For that money we signed the second best CB paring in the prem 😂😂 Honestly still does, which is saying something True, but you're saying that as if PSG losing relevance was a bad thing. especially when people already consider it a ""farmers league"" outside of France. so this happening is only going to reinforce that and lead to some real historic clubs potentially disapearing which is the sad part PSG obviously can't bail out Lyon or other bankrupt clubs by themselves but I think things like solidarity payments and being more proactive in negotiating Ligue 1 broadcasting deals with their global brand can help the league become more financially stable in the long run. Except he was fit last season and still rode the bench. He didn't lose the starting spot to anyone 'cause he was never a proper starter. In the first part of the season(think before the turn of the year), when Forest used 4ATB, which was most of the time, it was Murillo and Boly starting together most of the time, though Niakhate saw game time though to Forest using 3ATB, meaning there was more game time for CBs.  In the second half of the season, it was Murillo and Omobamidele starting together most of the time. At no point in the season was Niakhate a priority starter. Wasn't Valencia in an even worse state financially than Lyon is ? They didn't get relegated as far as I know No. France clearly has only one giant club. Documentary series profiling some of the working class citizens of a street in Manchester. I messed up my ankle pretty badly at 16. Played through college in the States while studying computer science and still playing Sunday league in my 30s. You'll find out, City has the best lawyers for a reason! Oui Monaco is neat, like I thought after all the issues their Russian owner has had over the years the team would explode like Malaga did, but they've consistently managed to stay on the upper half of the table. coming from a club that did sell their stadium, its a loose loose...   we could pay several player salaries from what we have to pay for ""our"" stadium each year. And our deal is at a significant discount because we play 2nd division We would know, wouldn't we  High five for being millions of dollars/euros in debt probably because of Crystal Palace, tbf I m saying the deal being bad impacted them too That's pretty much what lead to this situation  Some shady deal was signed with Mediapro where Ligue 1 was supposed to get a 1 billion euros per year deal for 5 years, which was in huge part thanks to PSG's high star team (mainly Neymar and WC winning Mbappe)  But when COVID happened, Mediapro defaulted on the deal and it was cancelled. Problem is, a lot of those ambitious Ligue 1 clubs planned their finances with the deal in hand, and got into massive debt  And this debt lead to the next deal getting signed for a cheaper amount because of the buyers knowing how desperate the clubs were (I think it was as low as 400 million), and this just went on  So the only way PSG could've benefited the league can be considered as the thing that can collapse most of its clubs and turn it into an absolute one horse race where other teams would consider qualifying to the Champion's league to be the biggest achievement they can get  I assume clubs like Monaco and Nice weren't as ambitious or got helped by their owners, but this is a massive damage to the league nonetheless Valencia has completed a financial restructure. With investment led by Goldman Sachs, the club has been able to secure a 121 million dollars long-term financing and a 65 million short-term loan. This leaves the club without any local creditors in Bankia and Caxia. That club which cheated their way to an ucl? Saul Goodman wouldn't be good enough to save your club lmao. Are you actually boasting about having the means to squash out charges we all know City is guilty of, you included? This is why everyone hates shitizens.  Can't PSG bad this situation when a worldwide pandemic is the actual cause Yep I'm amused by the fact that a flair triggers you. I'm not trying to blame PSG, they actually have no fault relating to this. This is all on Mediapro for promising money they don't have  I'm just saying that the reason that the league was getting bids of 1 billion in the first place was because of PSG getting world known stars on the team and driving up the demand for watching Ligue 1 matches Definitely the flair and not your comment I wanted to bicker with someone tbh so it's annoying we agree so I actually do think this is psgs fault now 100%!"
"[Sky Sports] Jamie Carragher on Chelsea's transfers over the summer: ""Chelsea have just got to stop buying players, and players have got to stop signing for Chelsea.""","2024-08-19T19:21:24+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ewajgj/sky_sports_jamie_carragher_on_chelseas_transfers/","[No textual content]","6904","KimmyBoiUn","https://v.redd.it/4hcqkb0f8ojd1","**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**     *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* There are still 2 weeks I’m afraid to go outside and get signed by Chelsea Liverpool: dying of thirst watching another man drown. It is just quite funny at this point as a Chelsea fan.  115 charges vs 115 players was the perfect billing for the match yesterday That's it, we're buying Jamie Carragher [Fabrizio Romano]Chelsea reach agreement with Skysports to sign Jamie Carragher!!! Set to undergo medical soon! Here we go! I just don't understand what's the point of financial fair play if Chelsea can do this.  I'm not asking for an explanation about how they're doing it. I'm saying that if what they are doing is possible, the rules are useless and not accomplishing anything other than fucking with Everton. Chealsea should get a transfer ban for their own safety Why are players signing?  Simple ... it's easy money being thrown around.  Many players today are in it for the money, and chelsea is essentially a public ATM now.  So why not take advantage of it. The thing for me is, so many of them might very well just be in it for the money, but how many of them then cry that they're not getting enough playing time after a few months? And how many times have we seen that same thing play out over and over again? Sell off one player , two more shall take his place , hail Hydra! I'M BEING SHERIOUSSSSS He's assuming that players have the same ethic/desire to play that he did.  If someone offers you a huge payday, guaranteed for 5+ years, you'd need some serious convincing to not sign it surely? They're giving away money to players to play for a pretty big club popularity wise. Why wouldn't players sign? A lot of them probably grew up watching a good Chelsea side. This isn't surprising lol. unpopular opinion:   Players, who know that they are one injury away from never playing football/soccer again, should take the Chelsea deal. Get paid to sit around. And earn 1000x more than the average Joe.   Chelsea is laundering players. They are treating them like real estate. Buy them when they are cheap, do a fixer upper, turn a profit which is more than the amortization schedule that they get signed on. Explains the 8-10 year deals. when chelsea is doing a mistake never interrupt them - sun tzu , art of 443 Jamie is sounding like my FM sporting director. I know siginig this Columbian kid as a starter is not good for the chemistry, but look at the potential man Clearlake are turning Chelsea into a hedgefund where the players are the assets to buy low and sell high. They’re playing all the FFP games to increase their balance sheet and buy players. Bro is spitting facts More to carra's point, with felix coming in and maybe 10 more, how you gonna say that you will play even 50% of the upcoming matches? Aside from cole in that fromt three they listed, this guy could keep rotating without allowing anyone to gel properly. No kid is actually gonna DEVELOP if not playing even a bit consistently  And chelsea has very rarely been a place for development from raw talent to finished product. why commit yourself to seven years of wages when FFP could end at any point and wages will skyrocket A lot easier to convince young players. They’ll have family pressure at times. It’s not like football is always for the highly educated. A lot of these players start life in tough situations so when you can guarantee them that kind of money for that length of time, it’s a no brainer.   Obviously I’m not suspecting anything that Chelsea are taking advantage in that way but I mean, they’re buying players for 10s of millions who haven’t even played a game yet. They could break their leg tomorrow, never have played a game and the bank balance is something most of us can only imagine.  As for the more household names, I can see a point from Jamie. I’m not sure what kind of success can be seen with Chelsea if that’s what gets you going professionally. The money is big but the job security is even better with those contracts, I would be terrified of potentially losing all my income after an injury on a one year contract How do Chelsea fans even connect to their players and what not. Like with Atleti i know everything who’s coming who’s going i know everything about every individual player. How are Chelsea fans gonna know where Mudryk had gone on holiday to or what he’s having for breakfast if you’ve got another 80 players to focus on He makes sense, the owners at Chelsea see players as assets and hope to either loan or play them if they can so that they can sell them for profit in the future. Academy players will continue being fed into that machine, there is a slight illusion into trying to win actual trophies like a normal club would do.   I keep hearing how they are sacrificing current sponsorship deals in the hopes that they are going to get a bigger deal in the future if they get CL. Well, if you’re currently missing out on £25-£30m in annual shirt sponsorship per year, that revenue loss has to made up somewhere else. Either the fans will suffer because prices for merchandise, tickets and shirts will go up. Or they can further strip the assets of the club to cover those losses (like the hotel sale). I think it is easy to look back at your successful career and say ""back yourself"". It's harder to say no to £40,000 per week guaranteed for 8 years.... That's £16.5m. If you dont make it at Chelsea, you are settled for life. If you dont make it at Liverpool, you will need to find another source out income Someone needs to tell Boehly the bullpen is not a thing in football. Jamie Carragher is right. As a Chelsea fan it pains me to say it, but what the fuck Todd and co. We have no plan or even a sense of direction. Hold up. As a United fan, I'm still hoping that they will offload Sancho from us. Then they can stop. The players who signed for Chelsea in the last year signed for the money, no more no less, wasting their formative years. I understand what Jamie is saying but he is Jamie Carragher. Most players won't ever be even half as good as him.   So if I'm a player and I know I dominated against fuck all competition compared to premier league quality and Chelsea hands me a 7-year £100K per week wages. There is no way in hell I'm saying no to go sign for lets say Southampton or Bologna who will pay me a 3+1-year £35K. All the players are young. Probably have an agent / devil on their shoulder telling them to take the bag regardless of whether it's most career enhancing. Imagine Chelsea probably splashing the agency fees as well. It's a more nuanced issue.  Players aren't simply just going to stop signing for Chelsea if they offer contracts with the length that spans some players entire careers. Like seriously, Palmer was signed last year up until 2031.  After a great season he immediately gets a bumper contract up to 2033. With just a season of good performances Palmer just secured a huge bag for a decade.  Obviously, nothing wrong with securing your best player for a long time, but who's to say that if Palmer has another 1-2 good seasons that he won't want another bumper deal? And another after another 2 years?   Now, Chelsea fans will say that their wages aren't as high and that's true, but if you want to compete for trophies you will have to enter the bracket of wages that Arsenal, Man City and Liverpool pay their top players to actually keep the players who can get you to fight for those big trophies.   And if you will pay your top players similar wages to clubs mentioned above and give them ridiculously long contracts this will spell massive financial problems. 15 of the players in the 40+ number that is being thrown around won't be here in the next few weeks i.e. loans and being sold. This faux outrage about our squad size is a bit over the top.   For all the criticsm (which is deserved imo) of the transfer strategy most people seem to forget the part most of the younger players will be loaned out and sold for profit when discussing our squad size.  The club is also actively trying to cull the older contracts to get players on cheaper wages - Sterling was dropped despite being ahead of Mudryk all pre-season. Chilwell will likely be sold too.  The strategy is wack but the misunderstanding around it also frustrating af. Excited to see how many more Chelsea can sign before the window ends! “Why are they signing?” Err lots of easy money Silly Uncle Jamie, who am I to say no if they offer me an 8 year contract? Currently, Chelsea have more than 40 players. Indeed, this is an unhealthy squad. I mean he‘s right. With more than 40 players it‘s crazy to organize a training. It‘s impossible for the manager to talk to each player and maybe even some youth prospects.  And in the end, it‘s close to impossible for the team to form itself with an identity. They're trying to combine the Brighton model with a big club model without realising that they're going to get rinsed on every transfer because they're Chelsea. The just signed felix again 😂 Chelsea is a joke now. They still need a striker though I agree with him so much. I am baffeled every time a player signs for Chelsea. Going to a proverbial big club in London for nice wages… I get   Signing anymore than a 5 year deal is DIABOLICAL and he’s completely right.  Sign a 4 year deal and BACK yourself to actually get PAID when your contract runs down, and a shorter contract would put pressure on Chelsea to actually play you. All of these players going to chelsea are incredibly naive Chelsea build a squad like Uwe Boll casts a movie whenever someone gives him money. Yes we need a zillion keepers. Yes Burt Reynolds should play a medieval king. I feel like you're all missing the point of he's discussing this from a sporting success point of view   Obviously people want more money but that's not what he's criticising here Spot on to be honest. Chelsea may well end up being the first team to ever make it work but no team has ever had success with this big a squad of players who want to be playing.  It’s not even the quality you’d worry about, it’s just moral.  And they’re unsellsble on these long contracts, you’re gonna have players downing tools to force moves when they’re not playing  Sterling situation will just continue to happen and most of Chelsea’s wage bill is gonna be out of the squad It was a lovely summer not having to listen to him and Rio. Easier paycheck than going to Saudi! get to stay in England, play shit in training and then you don’t even have to play at the weekend! Joke of a club, can’t blame players for signing tbh The whole team played great but you can't seriously have Jackson as a striker. What show is this? Anyone know where I can stream a link of this in the states? Lol...anyone in their right mind would go to Chelsea. Small chance of playing, huge checks, why not? Strap in, there's more windows and more transfers coming up Chelsea be wanting to sign players. You have to tell Chelsea no. I’m not well versed in ffp rules and whatnot, but from what I understood from all the experts around here is that Chelsea can sell a player for 30m and then proceed to buy 5 players for 30m over 5 year contracts and spread around the duration and break even. Am I missing something here? Never thought I would agree with Carragher on anything but here we are. I think Chelsea is just not the same anymore. I hope Liverpool don't fall in a hole like this with Arne. He never misses Boehly to PL: Do an all-star game.  PL:  No fuck off.  Boehly: Fine. I'll buy 50 players and have my own all-star game. God damn it, I hate when I agree with Carragher. Nobody knows what the fuck they're doing... 1B+ in transfers, 100 year of contract and 1 Gazillion players later they're still buying players and FFP ain't doing nothing about it...  If they're banking on potential promises and just doing this to resell, it's still bad for the business in the long run.  And if it's genuine team building (which is impossible) then the manager would go mental in coming weeks.  They're literally playing Football Manager at this point with the glitch. Chelsea just copying nfl style , they’re creating two big teams in their squad , one attacking and one defending team We’re drowning in talent but we can’t seem to use the talent effectively. Zero chemistry and cohesion, resulting in shitty playmaking and no chances created. I can’t stand David Jones A Chelsea legend is needed in that Skysport seat. A lot of this talk will just not be happening this way. I’d sign and be Chelsea’s 9th choice keeper, I’m sure it’ll still be more than my current wage. How do you manage 42 players My only question (I’m naive) regarding these contracts is surely they still amount to a tremendously large buyout sum for other clubs?   I’ve always seen it through the lens of a united fan, where we’ve struggled for over a decade to shift anyone due to Woodward economics. Where players worth X are on far too much money contract wise, so no club will go in for them - to the point where the transfer fee is either pennies, or free, and you’re in this damned if you do, damned if you don’t situation.   You sort of expect them to offload however many players in the coming years, but I really can’t see them actually moving? Not the majority anyway? What’s the incentive? Loads of guaranteed cash and the options will surely be poor if their potential does not work out?   By all means feel free to educate / correct me. I just cannot see how the club proceeds without becoming us (Man U) 2.0 or current Barcelona, who either aren’t paying players or are practically shoving them out the door! Anyone could tell them this lol. Jamie with the intervention lol. K I genuinely think It's a gambling addiction Didn’t this guy spit at a little girl? [deleted] Why would the players say no to the ridiculous contracts Eggball is offering them? At this point, a youngster signing for Chelsea is the equivalent of an author winning a New York Times bestseller I hate a lot of Jamie Carragher takes, but he’s nailed this one. I say this as a Chelsea supporter… Reckon if I kick a ball around in the nearest park for a week I might get a contract until 2035? Saw a tweet that yesterday was 115 charges vs 115 players Chelsea sound like WCW with Ted Turner money in the 90s. Big money, big contracts, too many people to reasonably use...  What's the Chelsea equivalent of Buff Bagwell? Honestly apart from the salary, why would you sign for Chelsea currently? The 6-7 year contract is a trap. That's 90% of the career of most players Chelsea will stop buying players when Jamie Carragher stops talking bollocks.  So roughly never. This doesn’t fit the media’s narrative but has anyone considered that the project is actually appealing to young players? Yes the deals are long but if people actually care to look at the wages then they aren’t that mind blowing. Caicedo and Lavia flat out said that they found the Chelsea project more appealing than Liverpool and Liverpool offered both of them more money. If you’re a young player offered a long term contract at a club you probably watched have a lot of success growing up, and you’re in West London to boot then it’s no surprise that you’ll sign. Especially if a lot of other exciting young players are signing there as well. Carragher is not somebody whose football opinion has a lot of weight behind it. The man won 0 titles. Do Barcelona next Jamie. And Jamie Carragher should stop spitting on little girls They sign for one reason. Money….look at Rashford…doesn’t care if he wins or loses each week, cause he knows he’s getting paid £300k regardless of the result An 8 year deal on £80,000 a week living in London is why you sign the deal Jamie Back when he played players weren’t playing potentially up to 60+ games a season. Chelsea is simply building depth for squad rotation. Excessive in short order, sure. Doubt Chelsea will be excessively buying players the next few seasons. [deleted] wtf is he on about Man whoever gave this man a mic owes the world an apology. [deleted] Chelsea are a front for money laundering. Simplest explanation is usually correct. Does he realise we are offering low low wages with huge incentives? Proof that Liverpool DNA is just being allergic to transfers “When I was playing” when you were playing they weren’t playing 80 games a yr mate Jamie Carragher the new r/antiwork mod  Some people dont understand that longer contracts doesn't mean that players will not get salary increase. Sure they may be offering an 18 year old 60k pw over 9 years compare to say 100k for 5years other clubs offer. But their is just no downside for them in this deal. They play bad they have the security of a 9 year contract, they play good they will just get a new improved salary. Just look at Palmer he got a salary rise after one year of good performance. He performs well this year he will get another pay rise.  This is just a great security for lot of the players coming from undoubtedly poorer conditions.  Now lets suppose that Palmer reaches Salah level in year 5 with 4 years remaining in his contract. He will demand Salah contract and Chelsea will have to pay it to keep him happy otherwise there is possibility of drama. Some Chelsea fans will say they will just sell him, well the money they get will have to be used to get a similar level player+ salary. So you get your top worldclass players in wc salary for long time. Couple of unwanted players with long term lower salaries couple years down the line All those players but none, bar one or two, good enough to challenge for the league. Pointless. *Million dollar man Ted dibiase theme plays* He's right. Chelsea's purchase model looks good on paper, but only on paper. I get the gut feeling this is like that QPR season on mega steroids. Jamie Carragher is wise  if you are so bad at something as Chelsea is identifying talent and signing players, you need to stop and not embarrass yourself. just do something else Do they actually have 6 goalkeepers? Jamie Carragher spits in the face of little children  Never forget this. Jamie doesn't even hide his hate these days. Poor fella must be dying so much inside whenever we sign someone.   I want our board to sign couple more players just to see him cry again 😁 Liverpool just doesn’t understand how to sign anyone and they are have a seizure. [deleted] Boehly: “I don’t think so” [deleted] easier said than done, try to stop signing players? You can't Proper club lmao damn Why not sign for chelsea? It's free money Really irks me when ex-players pretend money and club “brand”/“size” aren’t the two most important things for most players deciding their next move — as they have been for decades. Most players do not care how well a club is run.   Carragher would’ve jumped at the chance to go to Galactico-era Madrid and double his wages even when they were a complete mess. Chelsea: you know what, I'll sign more players even harder now Just enough time to expand the dressing room Its like a hyrda. 1 out, 2 in. Felix in for gallager..just need 1 more to come in now. Another GK incoming They need another 2 RW and another 4 AMs another goalkeeper maybe? Had a recruiter message me today on Linkedin about a job opportunity in London. Starting to think it might be Chelsea, I played left back for my school so they're probably bringing me in as cover for Cucurella. Not gonna wear blue until Sept 1 in case they accidentally sign me My mate just tossed his car keys over to me. I was afraid to catch them for fear of being signed by Chelsea. Hide yo kids, hide yo wife, cos they signing everybody up in here! Chelsea: Flirting. Liverpool: Harrassment Brilliant analogy, lol. It's the classic donkey and the egg problem. If the donkey doesn't milk the.. if the egg doesn't boil the.. if the chicken doesn't hatch the milk then... if donkey doesn't buy the egg, then the egg doesn't make bacon. It says a lot when I'm upset a signing for a no. 2 keeper fell through Spot on I love that analogy, man Liverpool fans think they have it bad? We've sold two good prospects and bought 2 back up keepers and a striker who's never scored.... Come home, Raheem GOATed TFS reference Why doesn’t Liverpool just sign Sterling? I can't believe he's still bitter about Caicedo U lots are lucky u don’t have 115 charges Lmao 7 year deal? Quite sure Zola still has him on a leash so he'd count already  There We Land* [deleted] Chelsea are banking on sustained success in 3 years time.   If the project doesn’t come together they are royally up a creek.     They’re amassing a bunch of long contracts and once we get to the half way point you’re going to see them start to offload players who they see as underperforming or not fit the model, and they’re anticipating on getting enough from transfers going out and prize money to stay sustainable.   You’ll see in about 3-4 years they’re going to come back down to the shorter term contracts.    They’re trying to build a stable base right now and banking on it paying off. It’s okay because Cole Palmer’s value has increased loads and now he is so good that they’d never want to actually sell him and realise that value. Because financial fair play isn’t about and has never been about creating a level playing field. Its entire purpose is to ensure that owners don’t spend beyond their abilities, and in so doing potentially put the club itself at risk.   Everton got punished because it has shitty owners that don’t have as much capital as other clubs and spent more than would have been sustainable. Chelsea’s owners are a huge conglomerate of multiple billionaires. Financially they are fine, the club is at no risk of going bankrupt. What they are at risk of is becoming a permanent mid-league club that’s entirely structured around a business model that doesn’t require winning. FFP has no issue whatsoever with that and it never has. >other than fucking with Everton.  when you put it that way i'm not particularly opposed i mean they can do it for now. but it is likely that they won't be able to generate enough profit during the next years Chelsea have also been selling lots of players tbf It's just about balancing books that's it, clubs including Everton voted for it.  So really it's stops a team doing this sort of Chelsea think and not having to do anything to balance it and racking up a huge debt. And italian teams in general lol You can buy as many players as you like as long as you're also selling (which Chelsea are doing with great success). Also, the whole point is you're allowed to invest a certain amount in a 3 year period, which Chelsea's new management haven't reached yet. I think we'll really see the full extent of Chelsea's PSR situation next summer, but as long as there's a market for their players they'll be fine. The real problem is for clubs like Newcastle and Everton who historically haven't sold very well until very recently. Because they're selling almost as much as they're buying. But no one focuses on that just the buying part They’re aiming for a net zero spend this window. They’ve only got a net spend of £65 million this summer, they’ll probably sell enough players before the end of the window to get close enough to net zero. I mean, they still sell players, while everton is rarely do so. You might wanna look more into this as chelsea is chipping for selling their young players like gilmour, tomori, even the recent 45m ian maatsen.   Also income from merch and tickets, and everything else.   At this rate, it might be a problem for chelsea in 3 years time, unless they profit from selling players in 3 years time. >  I'm saying that if what they are doing is possible, the rules are useless and not accomplishing anything other than fucking with Everton.  I mean, sounds like you fully understand it, you just don't agree (rightfully!). Apparently selling players for pure profit is amazing for FFP so that's why they forced gallagher and chalobah out I guess. an alternative strategy would be to sign less players players. What are the odds that felix will be a good signing? he hasn't been consistent ever and you won't get into this chelsea team then. they've actually sold a number of player in the last 2 years, as for the transfer's coming in they're not expensive and not a big wages. By signing longer deals they spread the expenditure over a longer period of time so that FFP doesn't nag them. It certainly needs looking at. Chelsea have basically found a way to just gamble despite the rules. The rules exist to prevent such gambling. The club have drastically cut the wage bill and they have sold a ton of players and plan to sell a good amount more before the window closes. That is how they balance the books and comply with FFP/PSR. The media only pushes the narrative of the astranomical transfer fees the club have paid but never mention anything about the net spend overall and fee structure put in place and how much wages have been cut since Roman’s era. It is only possible for a certain amount of time. They can only keep splurging so long as they sell high-value (Mount, Havertz, Gallagher) or wage-expensive (Lukaku, Sterling) players from the old regime. Once the well dries up, which it damn nearly is, it becomes unsustainable unless we are winning 2-3 trophies a year.  Also, Afaik, the 2-3 billion that Clearlake paid to purchase the club still hasn’t been allocated to Ukraine, which is just as shady if not more so than the Clearlake’s accountants finding loopholes in PSR and FFP. This is not deflection, I’m just pointing out that, yes, things are probably rigged in Chelsea’s favor. You don't know and you also don't want to know, but wants to keep complaining? Lmao The squad would be so much better in 1-2 years time if we just had a transfer ban “If Chelsea call, you have to sign for it“ kit Harrington We need a second locker room Honestly. It’s always been about money for the players. I don’t fault players going for money when their skillset will be useless for the remaining 50 years of their life after their body breaks down. Novelty wears off after a while though.  Eventually you want to leave, and realise you can't because your contract is too long and Chelsea have too strong a negotiation position to just let you go like that.  Besides, Chelsea aren't the only team that can guarantee you money. It's not like everyone else is paying minimum wage and Chelsea are alone in offering £100,000-a-week contracts. Yet the average salary has drastically been reduced and Chelsea. Felix isn’t getting a pay increase joining either. >Many players today are in it for the money,   They always have been since the birth of professional football in 1885. Chelsea isn't paying high wages at the moment. Liverpool offered higher wages to Caicedo than Chelsea and he still chose Chelsea. Like someone else said, this generation of players grew up with Chelsea as one of the best teams but If they don't get back on top soon that'll probably change again and they won't be viewed as a big team that attracts players. >Many players ~~today~~ since forever are in it for the money  Ftfy. Especially with the lengthy contracts being dished out. Sterling was signed on a 5 year contract at £300k a week. That's £78 million. Enzo 8 years at £74 million,  Palmer 9 years at £61 million. Caicedo 8 years at £60 million, Mudryk is on an 8 year contract totalling £40 million.  Most players take a 3/4 year contract then hope they get it renewed. There's no way you wouldn't take the money Chelsea are offering That’s exactly what he says so >So why not take advantage of it.  He has got a point here though. If youre a player at this level, youre good anyway. Your contract will be good money and you can always go up and make more if you perform. But if youre part of an unserious project that has way too many players and you dont have guaranteed playtime and development you might just hamper your career.   They are all millionaires set for live, what do they need a 7-year contract for? At this point I am not even blaming chelsea because I assume they got some sort of plan here, as weird as it looks from the outside, but as a player what are you doing signing for them? They bench you for an entire season and your career nosedives like you couldve just went to the saudis instead then. Chelsea, pls sign me too, my fax no is: 555-PLS-SIGN-ME-888 Nonsense. Players have always been in it for the money and yet players still are competitors. Players aren't one thing. You can get a lot of money anywhere if you're good. It's not like they're throwing around Saudi money. Players would make comparable money elsewhere and actually be in a good place for their career too On the one hand you're locked into a safe guaranteed 7 year contract, but on the other that means no raise for 7 years. Meanwhile players at other clubs are signing new contracts with higher wages and bonuses every 2-3 years. I remember Verratti at PSG, it seems he was extending/renewing his contract every 2 years and for sure was increasing his wages with a couple mil on top as a bonus.   And with how fast transfers and wages are rising lately it would make more sense financially to renew every couple years to match the market. Plus no ability to force a transfer when your contract isn't expiring soon. Long contracts are really a lose lose for both clubs and players. Is it really easy money in the long run? I doubt Chelsea to be paying Saudi league levels of salaries to them enough to make them uninterested in having any more career after Chelsea.   And I really wonder what kind of club is gonna be interested in buying a player that played 10-20 games in the last 6 years once their long contracts are over. London not a terrible plane to live when you’re rich either The best money will always be had at clubs that win things regularly, the sponsorships/endorsements available as a result combined with the contracts offered by the most successful clubs to their biggest dwarf anything anyone is getting at Chelsea. Haaland’s not about to sack off City for an 8 year performance incentivised contract at Stamford Bridge and not will the next Haaland.  If you back yourself to make the top and the top clubs are in, then it’s a no-brainer it’s those who aren’t so confident of making it to the very top who are swung by contract length, job security and the high floor on career earnings that Boehly is offering. That's not true at all. If anything most of these signings are on much less money than they were under Abramovich. I imagine security is a big part of it but also players are signing because they believe in the project. Caicedo and Lavia being prime examples of that. Also most of the players we're signing aren't top players yet just have high potential, so it's a lot easier to persuade them to join. Whether players keep believing in the project after questionable board decisions and another mediocre season Im not so sure... He makes that exact point in the clip - he’s saying players should back themselves and sign a 4 year deal and develop themselves and then get a bigger deal.   Of course some players will just take the guaranteed money now - and I don’t blame them. But it’s the exact point carragher is making. Personal and professional pride, honor, self-respect, ambition to contribute to something larger than oneself…things money can never buy and almost always taint and destroy. I can see how this exact scenario would benefit the players agent financially Can’t imagine their six goalies are thrilled. Petrovic, Jorgensen, bergstrom, and Sanchez are all 26 or younger. Think Gaga is still on loan from them too. How do you manage that in training. Next season they will start moving as it will be World Cup year. Can take a chilled one this season Why you laughing for?? I don't do ifsh, butsh, and maybesh, I do absolutesh Shit, i can hear him saying that XD I get that the contracts are long, but the pay ain’t that amazing if you’re good enough to sign for say Liverpool, City or someone else. Palmers new extension got him up to 155k p/w and supposedly is one of the top earners. Where does that leave some of the other Lads at 5-7 year deals when the by far best player in the entire team only makes 155k a week? Why not just get that same wage on a shorter deal, take a chance at another club and potentially land an even greater one when you actually have bargaining power. I think as a pro you naturally have the ego to believe you can make the first team as well These players could get similar wages at other clubs. They might not get 7 or 8 year deals but the wages they're getting at Chelsea aren't outrageous. And there are pros and cons obviously of having those long contracts. It's a big risk career wise, only 11 starting spots between about 115 players. > Why wouldn't players sign?  The wages Chelsea are giving aren't actually a lot if you are a high potential young player Chelsea at the moment aren't the right environment for growth with constantly changing managers it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of the big money signings they have made recently regret picking them,Chelsea are like United post SAF on steroids They also get to live in London which is a global city with lots of airports to visit their home countries on direct business class flights. London’s crazy expensive, but cost of living becomes similar wherever you go when you’re at very high salaries.  West London is especially great for BA and Heathrow. nonsense I think because they could be Chukwuemeka- Bought last year. Barely plays (also has an injury) and now they want to get rid of him to buy the next new potential signing. It's the obvious lack of care for the players- players are often treated like commodities but this is a more extreme version where they seem to be thrown away for the next shiny thing at the drop of a hat. >Chelsea is laundering players. They are treating them like real estate. Buy them when they are cheap, do a fixer upper, turn a profit which is more than the amortization schedule that they get signed on. Explains the 8-10 year deals.  Have they done this with a single player yet? Didn't the EPL change their rules for accounting players value to a max of 5 years since Chelsea started pulling this shit But the amortization window is now shortened to a max of 5 years I’m sorry but when you buy this many players and inevitably a bunch become squad players and barely play, how is Chelsea expecting them to rise in value. They’re not going to sell the likes of Cole Palmer, just the Trevor chalobahs of the team. Who won’t net the team much money at all. Or at least, not enough to keep up with ffp. That’s probably not all they are laundering How exactly are they going to sell players at a profit when those players will barely play in a barely functioning team so they are only losing value.. and they are paying ridiculous amounts Are they buying low and selling high though?   I don't see how the underperforming players who dont get enough game time to develop would ever sell for a profit. Unless they plan on selling their star players like Palmer. A kid you not, its the truth 😂😂 Is he? [deleted] Would be the first time They have a 28 man squad. It's not that hard to see how players are going to get minutes Yeah exactly, even if you back yourself to be the next big thing, it’s gonna be really hard to find space at Chelsea. If you don’t develop quickly enough, you’ll barely get any minutes and suddenly you’re locked into a 7/8 year deal with a club who now holds all the cards.  It’s not like a lot of these players wouldn’t have other options at big clubs too, a lot of big clubs have need of talent (Liverpool please sign somebody for the love of god) The only way FFP will end is if UEFA stops being a governing body or clubs leave UEFA for a super league.   And even if that happens I doubt owners other than the middle eastern ones would want to start paying even more. - It could also get tighter  - You aren’t actually 100% committed to 7 years of salaries if you do well. Palmer got an upgraded salary after just 1 year for a reason. Or you could get injured, or form drops off and you’re playing at a championship club. Moreover, Carragher has an advantage of both hindsight and being brought through a top academy and played his career as a journeyman. He’d never have gotten signed for champions league challenging Liverpool if he came up at Crystal Palace.   Makes this position more hypocritical though to me because why wouldn’t you sign with a historical successful club. They do.   Have read reports that they are also offering free coupons to Greggs for the family members. Also, Shiatsu massages for everyone at the agency. but why would they do that in 1st place? it makes 0 sense tbh I think the model you describe is exactly what people that support a football club do not want to see though - they specifically are against this idea that the richest football clubs will go out and buy dozens of players just to treat them like assets. chelsea are not going to loan out or sell 15 players in 10 days. even if they do, they'll just end up buying another 5. Chelsea do not want to wait until deadline day,  they'll be getting a raw deal for outgoing players.   Clubs will know they have to shift on players, and bargaining positioning is lower for Chelsea, getting a worse deal in many transfers or loans. >most of the younger players will be loaned out and sold for profit when discussing our squad size.  >The club is also actively trying to cull the older contracts to get players on cheaper wages  That's EA sports FC/FIFA Career 101.....Idk how it's gonna pan out for a real football club. Come back to us when all 15 players successfully are loaned/sold. You say that like its a garunteed anyone will want them. Also people have every right to be outraged about your squad when you are buying 10 players every window. Brighton have 40+ players too btw,  43 iirc. Every single one of these guys no matter the network hate Chelsea top to bottom so you give them a stage to rant about it this is the result. Sky That would add up for one season, if the sold player isn't still being is paid for or is an academy product. They still owe it for the following four seasons. He did Spat at her dad who was being a twat and she got caught in the splash zone. So yes, but he wasn’t targeting her. chelsea are not offering crazy money it is the length which appeals to players. That is crazy job security. It would be a book noone actually reads though. Chelsea players are literally here today gone tomorrow. An ever changing cast of ""who's that?"" players. None of them will become star names at Chelsea as things stand Will?     Wasn't it already reported that that is exactly what is happening The wages aren't even high. Long contracts yes, but the wages are normal. Liverpool offered Caicedo more money than Chelsea. Ok i’ll bite, whats so different when he played and now?     He was doing international pre season tours in south east asia, modern CL format, the FA and league cup format before they were shortened and same 38 league gameweeks.  Some of u r too new it shows Yes but for several seasons and for different managers He means every squad he was in. This can include England too. You literally can. Liverpool: zzzzz  I'm not even mad we did great buisness last summer. But all your eggs in one basket? Jesus!  I hoped Edwards would sort this out What does that mean What do you mean harder?  I think you know He think it's an American sport where you don't get relegate so you can buy the best and make the manager make it work or get fired.... 3 more keepers incoming easy, they can just play at fulham or qpr over the road. Domain Expansion: Boehlyball Time to sign another goalkeeper! I play in goal and I'm starting to get a bit offended by the lack of interest tbh A scouser with a LinkedIn page?! pull the other one! They'll try to sell you if you wear blue, or actually trade you for another colour +10 million and a 7 year contract What are you doing step--transfer policy? And they got it from a Dragon Ball parody lmao 15 yo me listening to my uncle give me dating advice. Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything? Ahh! Got it. This is perfect, thanks for the clarity :) No you’re thinking of United No fuck that rat, why would you want him lol I don't get why people are down voting this. Just as shady a club. Let's not go nuts. 6 with a 1 year option. ‘Wallahi it’s signed’ 'come-in-side' here we skedaddle Their wee lad Lmao long live Olivia Giwoo I don’t get this model though. Do they expect to make money on all these players? If they’re not performing or playing who’s gonna buy them? And surely not for more than they’re paying now. Feels like a situation where they could be held to ransom > banking  Bro please be honest. It’s not banking. It’s gambling. Let’s call it what it is. The fact that making such a gamble is even possible proves that the ""PROFITABILITY and SUSTANABILITY rules"" are completely unfit for purpose because not even Chelsea think this is sustainable and it sure as fuck isn't turning a profit.  Jesus Christ, is it that fucking hard to design a system of financial regulations that is enforced and which doesn't have gaping loopholes everywhere? Everything about PSR is incompetent to the point that you can't avoid thinking it's deliberately shit, set up to fail. >Chelsea are banking on sustained success in 3 years time.  That's a bold statement not backed up by anything they've shown so far. But this seems totally at odds with the whole concept of stability.  Do a thing that means if you don't sell players, who have presumably not played or underperformed, AND win a lot you're going to be absolutely screwed... This is a description of gambling not stability. Hasn’t Todd been around for 3 years already? Where’s the success? Where does this tie in with the club selling off assets for PSR? Or is this being massively overblown?  My understanding is Chelsea football club is selling off assets to Blue Co and banking that money for psr but doesn’t this devalue the club in the long term? It looks like asset stripping 101 from my, admittedly far from professional, opinion. Exactly. They are putting everything on having pretty big and consistent success within a few years. They are kicking the can down the road, but they can't stay away from FFP forever. 3-4 years they'll be doing a Leeds and imploding imo. I really don't understand why an usa investment firm would be ok losing so much money Good job they’re doing then  problem. if they do end up royally up the creek... then what you relegate them? they will just bounce backup and start again. you do a transfer ban ? for how long? they have been stockpiling like crazy...   like there is no real long term consequence to this enless you push them all the way down the leagues. but then PL will have fight a massive legal battle with one of the most powerful investment groups in the world when they already doing one with City....      there is no real good solution that will make people happy. the best thing actually is a forced sale again but good luck doing that they need equity release But aren’t Chelsea basically taking on long term risk with all these long contracts and fees spread out over time? That would indicate that the system isn’t working to avoid the club putting itself at risk. This is why it's rebranded as PSR. It's nothing to do with fair play, if anything it only gives established teams an even bigger grip on their position.  It's all just hidden behind sustainability, and whether teams can do what they're doing and survive long term. Which for most EPL teams, with the TV money alone, yeah they can.  Issue is that the gap between the bigger and smaller club has grown so much, that to keep up the little clubs have to make huge risks which trigger PSR issues...  TLDR - it's all bs to keep the big 6 as the ""big 6"" while hiding it behind stopping things like Bury or Southend etc from happening again. i for one welcome FFP Yeah idk the problem here Over the last two years your net spend is one billion pounds. Didn't forget that with an easier schedule their body won't break down as early so they can also get an extra few years. Chelsea is a great option for someone who's not getting in to top clubs as a starting player The question is good math though. Say Chelsea gives them 8 year contract with total wages of 60M but Liverpool offers 50M over 5 years. That's what betting on yourself means - the next contract will be even bigger and if you wait till you free agent you can get a signing bonus too. They earn more money in a year than me or you will have in our life Not sure it always has when footballers have at points made quite average salaries in many places  It’s weird that people use this as a justification for working for money. When most of you work for money and it never really ever needs to be justified.   People really try to live their dreams through sports players. The long contract is leverage for both player and club. Yes, if you’re a desirable player that someone wants to buy, the long contract protects Chelsea, but when Chelsea are trying to sell you with 6  years left on your deal, it benefits the player who can sit and take home the £30m left on their contract or choose where they want to go or negotiate a payout to leave.  Hence why the players Chelsea are actually able to sell are on short deals - Sterling, Gallagher, Chalobah.  If you’re a 20 year old kid and Chelsea offer you a 7 year £90k week deal, even if it goes to absolute shit, you and your family are set for life, you’ve won. The novelty of that doesn’t seem to wear off. Being a London club probably helps too.   London is an amazing city when you're rich - so a 7-year deal on £100,000+ a week to play football in a nice city is a pretty sweet deal.  Living around Manchester or Liverpool doesn't have quite the same appeal. > It's not like everyone else is paying minimum wage and Chelsea are alone in offering £100,000-a-week contracts.  It was reported recently that the average salary of a player signed by the new ownership is something like 60k. Chelsea are not paying these players that much. Yeah but many of these players are younger guys, they have no idea about what awaits them in their 7 year contracts I wonder if there are diminishing returns eventually. The players they've signed haven't increased in value, so can they rely on the academy to keep raising funds? Because if not, they're in trouble. Take Tosin for example. It is extremely likely that they signed him on a free only so that they can flip him next year. Why in the world would he sign for them? He probably could have gotten a better wage somewhere else. depends Caicedo before moving to chelsea was making like 15k a week wich in football terms is chump change Yeah, 7 or 8 years is a LONG time especially when you’re younger and even moreso when you’re in a profession where you’ll only be active for 15-20 years.  You can certainly understand why they do it but I think Carragher is spot on about signing a normal length contract and backing yourself, especially considering a lot of these players are clearly very talented and would have been welcomed at other top clubs. Yes, they were in it for the money when there was no money to be made and they had to work another job on the side. Brilliant. 2$ in 3 years = 6$  1,5$ in 7 years = 10.5$  Are you sure you will not drop form or injury yourself in the next 3 years? [deleted] Liverpool didnt offer him an insane 8 year contract like chelsea. They offer 4 or 5 years > Liverpool offered higher wages to Caicedo than Chelsea and he still chose Chelsea.  source? Lmao yes all these players join Chelsea because they grew up with Chelsea being good, it has nothing to do with the long valuable contracts they offer. This isn't true, or at least was never reliably reported by anybody involved at Liverpool. Wages were never agreed with Caicedo from a Liverpool perspective as he was waiting on Chelsea's offer. Liverpool only agreed a transfer fee with Brighton.   I suspect that Chelsea offered higher wages or, at the very least, the extra long contracts Boehly loves to hand out were a factor in the decision. This is an incredible lie lol. Cole palmer just signed another contract, doubling his wage to 130k, almost all the new signings have low wages like he did with the ability to trigger a wage bump if they perform. Malo Gusto is another one who’s about to get more money on his contract. They are going to one of the biggest teams in Europe? This isn’t a Saudi or MLS move, Chelsea have won two champions leagues this century ffs. Yeah i originally had a bit more written down. For example how too many young players get brainwashed by agents as soon as they show ANY form of talent.... And to think that there is not clean cut #1 amongst them doesn't help the situation (tbf i'm not a super avid PL watcher, surely some of them are better than the others in certain areas, as per usual). A bunsh of players with the same position fighting for 1 spot and none of them are long term team veterans with any internal standing in the club. Obviously especially hard for GKs since there litterally is only 1 position and that position rarely sees rotation to begin with. Every other year there is some big tournament (Euros or World Cup), so that arguement is just incredibly soft. This isn't a one time 2024 thing. This isnt even just a Chelsea thing. > Palmers new extension got him up to 155k p/w  As a base, not a ceiling. The best player at Chelsea isn’t ’only’ making $155k a week, that’s what he makes if he doesn’t score goals and the team doesn’t make the champions league.   >Why not just get that same wage on a shorter deal  In some cases Chelsea is probably offering higher wages in the first couple of years.  > but the pay ain’t that amazing if you’re good enough to sign for say Liverpool, City or someone else  Liverpool aren’t signing anyone and Chelsea aren’t competing with Man City for most of their signings.   There’s only a handful of clubs willing to sign big money for unproven young talent like Chelsea does. If you’ve proven good enough that Liverpool or Man City really want to sign you, you don’t fit Chelsea’s model. because the best club to have a career threatening injury at is chelsea. those clowns will you pay you for near on a decade regardless You are correct. Lavia and Caicedo outright said they found the Chelsea project more appealing than Liverpool so they're clearly saying the right things.  A lot of these guys have played together or against each other from a young age and probably do feel like with time that the team can perform. The long contract also gives them security and Chelsea have shown with Palmer that if you perform you'll get rewarded too.  The glamour of being in the richest part of London for young footballers is also something you have to account for. What are the Cons from the player's perspective? If they do well they can force a move for bigger money..? An extra 3 years on the contract more than makes up for any wage difference That number is property of a different club. 115 is becoming the ""6 months"" meme of this sub ffs 💀 [deleted] I genuinely feel Chelsea are trying to be Brighton.   I know alot of jokes where made when they started poaching Birghtong back room staff and even the manager at one point.   But if Chelsea and its fans are happy at basically becoming a feeder club for other bigger clubs then fine.   They may end up with a sold first team and make idk top four at some point. The idea is to then sell all those players ( my understanding is they are run by investors? even Eghabli is one? ) for big profit, bring int he next round of young players and rinse and repeat forever. Bought Hutchinson for ~3m, played a season of u-21s then went on loan to Ispwich and was sold this summer for 20m.   Got Diego Moreira in for free from Benfica’s academy 2 years later he’s sold for 8m.   And that’s before we count the sales like Maatsen who joined our academy at 16 and was sold for 38m . Hutchinson & Moeira spring to mind I mean it takes a little time for the value to amortization ratio to become favourable. It doesn’t happen after one season… hence the long deals Actually yes. All of Chelsea's outgoings have been a profit Contract length can be any period. Also amoritzation is for UEFA, not BPL   [Reddit - Amortization Study](https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/15qbuzs/anyone_know_if_this_is_really_how_the/) probably todd's grandmother's knickers too innit... There are going to be some flops like mudryk. It also helps that player wages are very low: its easy to convince them to go to saudi or elsewhere if its not working out.       Players who don't make it into the first team squad likely will still develop a bit, but more importantly have resale value. Just because they're not first team doesn't mean they don't have resale value: they get more PL experience and will mature. Look at Fabio Carvalho at liverpool: acquired <10 mil and sold for >20 even though he was loaned out nearly the whole time, and even one loan spell didn't work well.       They're all super young: so they'll usually have good resale value, and some will probably become quite valuable. Who knows about stars like palmer, but even for other starters: if they reach the last year of their contract, they can do what they did to gallagher, and use the contract rejection as an excuse to sell them. Am I the only one who caught /u/Far-Pineapple7113's joke ? Brilliant pundit.   🤣 So carragher is this sub’s football savant now? Fuck off lmao, the most clueless guy on TV Well 3 of that 28 will be getting exactly 0. Palmer is a nailed on starter everyone else can get anything as they've got a squad stacked with 6/10 Prem talent. And what about when one of those players plays well and still gets dropped next game. And then it happens again. And to someone else. And to someone else. Because he'll only have a main 15 that he starts.  And then Enzo's song gets brought up when he's captain and someone gets dropped again. Honestly, I think it's a ticking bomb that'll go off in terms of morale. 7 years is a long time - what if the saudi league takes off Journeyman? Carra was obviously not that as he played for one European level club. I agree Atleast 5 players (as i can remember) went out during last week either sold or on loan. I think it is fair to say they’re not waiting around on most. They are fairly easy to hate if we are honest still completely disgusting behaviour that doesn't justify spitting at someone though It’s still silly money for teenagers. [deleted] show our owners how, only transferban will make them stop but even then they will find a loophole At a certain point I wonder if people have considered that the Edwards/Data driven approach may have even been part of the problem? The idea that there is only 1 *perfect* player or train someone else to do the job. Would we have Gravenberch and/or Endo under that system? Its not as if there are many players that can improve Liverpool. Don't think there are any players like Zubamendi available > But all your eggs in one basket? Jesus!  God bless the hatchery! Fucking Liverpool could sign zero new players and still ball out like no other. Ugghhh Yang here, why don't Chelsea just sign 11 GKs and carry the ball to the goal line for a touchdown? Chelsea thought Starting XI meant ""start with 11 at each position"" Come on it isn’t Forrest.   I think Forrest have bought at least 5 GKs in the last 5 years and none of them were good. Another 2nd choice goalie, hopefully. They'll probably snap you up in January mate don't worry, I'm sure they've got eyes on you. I'm stuck in the transfer machine, help me get out! Depends if unc got the rizz Have you really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like? Best video on the internet. The shit eating grin at the end like ""nailed it"" Fool me — you can’t get fooled again! Just in case Salah needs resting. Wouldn’t want him starting Rumor is Chelsea is expecting at least a one year transfer ban for the stuff the new owners reported from the Abramovich era so that’s something. >Liverpool paid a £1m settlement to Manchester City after the Etihad club complained that their scouting system had been hacked, Sky Sports News understands. And the option is Carragher’s, not Chelsea’s I am circumcised https://youtu.be/N6Oqib-wMao?si=6SBk29pePpMRuitn They expect to make the same or slightly less on a player with a few increasing their value dramatically.   The long-term, low wage, incentive based contracts would be appealing for other teams to want a player. I don't understand it either,  they're paying superstar transfer fees for prospects and there simply isn't room for that many players to shine, so they're going to either take a massive loss on a lot of players or have to sell the only ones that do work out, more likely a bit of both. > I don’t get this model though  You’re not supposed to. It’s a stupid model with tremendous downsides. They won't, that's where the whole thing falls down. They aren't going to make enough selling the Washingtons, Angelos, Fofanas etc. so they are going to have to keep selling Cobham kids. Sure it's Gallagher and Chalobah now but it'll be Colwill tomorrow.   They aren't even that good at selling. They want rid of Chilwell, Sterling, Chukwuemeka, Lukaku, Kepa, Chalobah, and Madueke but they can't shift any at the moment. The old Chelsea regime bought duds but it was generally excellent at selling them. That's a ridiculous amount of deadwood to have considering most have been there less than 2 years.  And if they keep missing Europe it won't be long till the best players are angling to move to play in the Champions League. If Palmer is still their only elite player in a season or two he'll want out, same with Neto or Lavia or whoever works out.  Their only hope is that enough of these players work out. They look like they've got some decent ones but time will tell if they mesh. As Carra says, they've just got to stop adding more for a bit and trim the fat Not only is this the expectation from buying all these players, but they must know how they are viewed in club football right now.  A) The player is young enough that he can still be fixed.  B) It's Chelsea, he only failed because they are run poorly.  C) Chelsea wins with this squad and the players are part of the group that ""turned around"" a poorly run club.  All of those make enough sense to buy. Imagine the team they could have had if they spend 1.5 billion on 11 players The majority of the players will only need to be sold for 10-20 million in 2/3 years time to not hurt the books. Instead of forcing out youth talent they'll be forcing out talent signed last year. I can see that working ok. There's apparently plenty of PL clubs willing to help each other out  >Feels like a situation where they could be held to ransom  Yeah why other clubs aren't doing that is a mystery to me. Atletico bailed them out, which is probably why Chelsea got shafted with Felix. They think that players will keep getting more expensive I’d say no but for some reason they have a good track record of teams giving them money for players. More than they deserve the secret incredient ist multi club ownership I think it's a consequence of how the market is currently. There is a massive premium on young players with potential.  I think Chelsea are buying up loads of young players with lots of potential in the hope that a few of them turn out to be amazing and they can sell them for 100m each.   Will it work? I'm dubious. You need to give those kind of players a stable team and environment around them to give them a chance to grow. Chelsea don't have that. They're banking in the Ukraine war being over in two years and another Abramovitch coming in and pumping them well these players on such long contracts with relative cheap wages. we seen the market inflate insanely crazy...   so what a is 5 mill player today could be a 25m player in 5 years without actually improving a lot.   So even if they overpay they can recoup there losses and every big hit allows them to buy that much more.   i would not be suprised if in 2 years they sell palmer for 150m-200m wich would give them so much more time again and room to buy new players.   meanwhile keep selling those academy products for pure ffp profit    they are essentially becoming a more expensive dortmund.... Totally. Plus how is that stability. Win or sell players or you're screwed is the worst of the old situation these rules are meant to prevent!!! Chelsea is “banking” we all see it for what it is.  A gamble. To comply with any form of financial regulation for any institution, the people running the show needs to want to comply with the rules. There's no way to operate clubs otherwise. They can only be punished after the fact, you can't stop them making mistakes.  What loopholes do you think they are exploiting? Selling youth players? Take a look around the world. Clubs around the world have needed to sell their youth players to survive forever. It's the best way for clubs to be sustainable in the long term is having a youth academy which can continually attract and develop talent to sell.  The only ""loophole"" they exploited was selling the hotel to themselves and AFAIK they haven't had that approved by the PL so far. Yes.  Salary cap like NFL, NHL and NBA.  But doesn’t work for football due to the international nature of the competition. So much this. What people are describing is the worst of the pre rule scenarios. Gambling on having to win or fire sale the squad to survive is what was supposed to be prevented! They will get point deductions and what not, if they get relegated due to that - that is the punishment. Also they will be making losses at the same time.  I don't know why you would want to punish them further than that? They're taking mid-term footballing risk but not financial risk. The players they're signing now are their transfer funds of the future. For it to be a financial risk, it would have to go BADLY wrong. we're talking relegation. There's nothing to stop a club dwindling, financial fair play is to stop immediate risk really. Yes they are taking long term risk. They are going to have to concentrate every season from now on to water the garden even harder regarding leveraging their standing with FFP/PSA. This summer they sold some youngster for a huge sum and Aston villa did the same thing for the same reason.. yeah but this year it will be 0 When you're young, without that money, it's easy to swallow the 8 year contract and not worry about injury or form yeah but the selling club wont sell him to liverpool because chelsea offering a bigger transfer fee Bear in mind that the other half of the time this sub discusses salaries it's to argue that all of these contracts are generational wealth and pining for even more (Saudi money) is pointless. Some earn more money in a week than the average UK salary will in 5-10 years. Might as well maximize it then for them when they won't be making that money once they retire  That’s because you aren’t in the top 0.01% of your profession. Guarantee those guys make a fuck ton of money too. It's the other way around I think. Sterling, Chilwell, and Lukaku are struggling to be moved because their wages are astronomical, and fixed. So even with 2 or 1 year remaining people won't sign them and they won't downgrade their salary. We were stuck loaning Lukaku year after year for that reason. Gallagher Chalobah have plenty of suitors because their wages are lower. We're doing all these scummy practices to force them out bc we only have 1 year to find them a club and they don't want to leave.  The current contract philosophy is 'sign them on the same base weekly wage as teams a step below us (in terms of monetary ability), but across many seasons so total contract value is the same as the teams on our monetary tier. And they have the incentive to say yes to this drawn out contract because there are performance bonuses on an individual and team level""  So now if the player wants to move for game time, he can easily find a club that will accommodate that because his wages fit theirs If the club wants to move a player because it didn't pan out, they can easily find a player who will match salaries because his wages fit theirs. And we can see players like Angelo are already being shopped and it seems like Besiktas are looking to take a punt despite him being signed just last year on a long ass deal. There are no issues because Angelo wants to play and Besiktas can afford his wages  The only way this backfires is if the player drops so grossly far below his value he's completely unplayable. But realistically someone like Ugochukwu who's 20 and on like 50k a week (according to transfermkt), it's hard to imagine his value dropping lower than that.  The contracts aren't the issue here. Commercially I don't think we've done much wrong. It's the footballing side that has been a total shitshow. [deleted] Realistically players are living in like Cheshire or something, where a ""cheap"" multimillion pound house looks like [this](https://lid.zoocdn.com/u/1024/768/60e015f562d304d2c00ec07da351be09b8d5325c.jpg) I hear this non-stop, do people really think that the player signing for Liverpool, Manchester United/City or idk any fucking club outside of London live in some run down shitty districts?  Im not from the UK, but isn't the UK full of posh victorian age mansions lol. A prem footballer who earns 100k p/w won't have a problem finding a house like that I don't buy that. I never hear about players in London going out and having fun and experiencing what the city has to offer. However, those living in Cheshire are always pictured in Manchester, and if they so wanted to, they could drive their £1 million Rolls-Royces to London at 100mph. The distance isn't that far also. Also, many younger people are leaving London for Manchester. Partly because it is cheaper, but also because the place is on the up and is pretty lively and vibrant. holy PL money bubble.. 60k per week is a metric fuckton for unproven 17 year olds Yeah let me see: get a truckfull of money garanteed right now and the next 7 years which is more or less the rest of my football carreer or receive the same or less for 3 years and risk injurying myself or drop form and missout the others 3-4 years money's worth. I know what i'm getting for sure. They know a fuckton of money awaits them for all 7 years😂 They also won't be failure. All they have to do is just have few runs of form and coast through and if the plan fails, it will be Chelsea's fault.  It's lot less pressure atm than any of the other top clubs. quicksand spectacular vast live gaping automatic point fade test insurance   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Generational wealth though, it would be hard to say another for any young player Theoretically they should be able to rely on the academy for funds forever if they keep investing in recruiting the best kids in London, the staff to train them and set up good loans when they’re 18-21  You only need one kid per year group to become like Reece James, Colwill, Chalobah, Solanke, Tomori, Maatsen, Guehi, Mount, Livramento, RLC, Hall, Gilmour.  Benfica seem to have financed their whole club with their academy sales for decades. Yes.  The whole point of the introduction of professionalism is to make it about money. Making 200k a week over 3 years compared to 150k over 7 years still leaves you with enough money to retire with if you simply invest in no risk investments.   Players don't just reach the highest level of football by accident. The number of footballers who are happy to just sit on their ass and collect a paycheck rather than actually playing football, after they've busted their ass off since they were children to reach that point to begin with, are a very small minority. Once again, look at the salaries. Palmer, after his new extension will make a total of 60m base salary over 9 years. Now compare that to Sancho who will make 65m over his 5 years at United, Grealish who will make 78m over 5 years at City and Havertz who will make 72,8m at Arsenal.  Yes our contracts are long but the total salary over the full duration of the contract is still in many cases less than what other clubs will pay in salary in total for players on 5 year contracts. Lmao yeah because Arsenal, United, Liverpool are poor poor clubs who don't offer big fees... come on man. You must think very low of many players if you think they don't care to win, elevate their career and grow in terms of earnings and recognition. exactly its not like chelsea are signing proven talents that are guaranteed to make it. They are signing young players and basically setting them up for life even if they dont end up good enough. Everyone would take that deal. Yep no one ever joins Chelsea because they want to join it’s only money and sneaky agents tricking their clients. And let me guess, you think Chelsea fan Declan Rice is at Arsenal because he loves you? This makes absolutely no sense. They are long contracts on low wages. If they were in it for the bag, why the fuck would spend 7 years on low wages? Precisely You know for sure players the age of Caicedo didn’t grow up wishing to play for your club    So you're mad Players don't settle for low wages and long contracts. They want to win, earn more and improve. Just like anyone else. My source is that I made it the fuck up A bunch of Chelsea fans seem to be parroting this completely nonsensical made up bullshit. It is always a combination of both. Chelsea has been a top top side for the best part of two decades now and young players do aspire to play for top sides who are also offering them long term contracts, so it is a no brainer Yea but in both those cases the players surely had an expected role and playing time valued into that contract. Last year they both played way more than expected (due to form for Palmer and injuries to James for Gusto), and established themselves as important members of the squad deserving a bigger contract. The Felix and Netos are already at a level where they won't get significant increases. Sure but you have to look at the present situation and the projected near future. It’s a total mess. They aren’t going to win any champions leagues in the next couple years. I’m not really bothered to respond to most of this as it’s just semantics. Most contracts these days offer performance clauses so i thought it would be obvious. Your second point is valid though, Chelsea do offer higher base wages for a lot of young people.  To your last point, Chelsea is indeed competing with City and Liverpool for different players, Arsenal as well. You’re just cherrypicking this window exclusively so that you don’t need to mention Lavia, Caiceido and Enzo. Even with a lot of our youngsters like Estevao and Kendry multiple top clubs were involved. >Lavia and Caicedo outright said they found the Chelsea project more appealing than Liverpool so they're clearly saying the right things.  If you take their comments at face value Easier to say 12 months ago, obviously those guys are going to rate Chelseas talent ID very highly because they identified themselves lol, But if they have another poor season and we have more ugly forcing out players, and the business model starts to shift and they start having to sell the few high performing players to keep PSR happy it gets a lot less appealing as a long term option The Chelsea project involves signing players with seemingly no plan for where they play or how they fit with their teammates.  So either the club is lying to the players or the players are lying to press. I mean, what else do you expect them to say. Chelsea just outprice other clubs for most of these, so there is no competition. You can't force your move though. You have leverage when you have 1 or 2 years left on your deal because the clubs don't want to lose you for nothing, but unless you're willing to go MIA, there's not much you can do if the club don't want to sell you. They also have a much lower chance of doing well there lol since they have to compete with 10 other players in their position and the club has no footballing vision 115 vs 115 round 1 was for us. See them in 2nd round His career didn't do great by having a long Chelsea contract. Him and about 15 others .  Matej Delač was there for 8 years and I don't think he played a game > Remember Lucas Piazon?  Not sure if that example makes the case you think. Piazon was a promising young player who went to a club where he didn't have a starting spot, did the loan merry-go-round for years, never settled, and likely stunted his development. Once that long contract was over he wasn't a hot commodity and went to the Portuguese league, where he also didn't shine.  Piazon is exactly the cautionary tale for these players signing super long contracts. It's much better to go to a stable club on a shorter contract, where you have a greater chance to play and develop, so you're not stuck until you're 29 and by then have no real suitors because you're seen as expired goods. > if Chelsea and its fans are happy     Have you spoken to any Chelsea fans recently? We are trying to buy young players with potential, let them develop and grow together, and try to compete for the title next year. It’s really not that hard to understand. You may disagree with it, but it’s clear what we are trying to do. Oh and we finished above you last year, with more injuries, so it’s not like the process has failed so far  Edit: the downvotes …. Tell me where I’m wrong. You can disagree with the strategy but it’s pretty clear > Got Diego Moreira in for free from Benfica’s academy 2 years later he’s sold for 8m.  Not sure Moreira counts given where he's gone. When Dortmund, ajax and Britton etc does it : FLIRTING.   When Chelsea does it: HARASSMENT > Got Diego Moreira in for free from Benfica’s academy 2 years later he’s sold for 8m.  Haha what horseshit. Sold for £1.7m to another club Boehly owns as a workaround for the 3 player loan limit from a single club.   https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-transfer-news-diego-moreira-strasbourg-b1176885.html You've literally described what every club does.   No club signs a player hoping they'll go down in value regardless if they play. Well it can be a one season thing, look at branthwaite. He played one season with Everton and then Man United were after him for big money.  In fact I can't ever recall this strategy of long term development ever working in football. There are clubs like Ajax, Southampton, Benfica and more but they want to get a young player in a team, establish him and move him on in a year or two.  Dortmund have done lots with buying players like Sancho, Bellingham, Haaland and others and move them on for a profit but again this is 2 years or so.  There isn't anyone doing what Chelsea are doing at all and that gives two options:  1. They have done genius that's never been thought of before. 2. They are doing something stupid.  Until they have some great results with massive gains that cover their $1bn donkey signings, I'm going with option 2. Ziyech, Thiago Silva  haven't been this season. What time span are you talking about?  Havertz has been bought for 80mil€ and sold for 75 mil€, Kovačič bought for 45 mil € sold for 29 mil €, Koulibaly, Pulišić etc.  Edit: probably missed /s  right? I can't think of one... They didn't make money on Havertz or Pulisic for example. When you factor in wages they lost there too, not just on the transfer fees.  Chelsea are selling their own home grown players in Conor Gallagher to settle the books and finance this crazy strategy they are currently on. It makes no sense at all.  And I use the term strategy loosely. Amortisation is for PSR too. It's just spreading the transfer cost over the length, max 5y, so naturally it would count for PSR It's a good point about Carvalho, and Chelsea do seem to be strangely adept at getting good prices for undesirable players.  Still, I just don't see how players like Felix, Neto or Enzo would ever recoup their value. I suppose only time will tell if it works or not. It's a joke? Didn't read like sarcasm to me but I could be wrong, or did you mean something else? I think Rio is duller Those 3 you’re talking about are goalkeepers, there’s potential for 60+ games this season depending how deep we go in domestic cups and conference league, and the club World Cup at the end of the season, plenty of games Not gonna take off in the next 7 years. Almost every player that isnt at the end of their career have rejected them. What do you think journeyman means? Providing context is not justifying something. No the saudi thing is complete bullshit. Liverpool made more from transfers for Saudi than Chelsea did. 3 players went to Saudi last summer from Chelsea; 1 on a free - Kante who was a free agent, Mendy who was sold for £16m and Koulibaly 25m (an ffp loss on him). The benefit of data driven approach is to find ""value"" players that aren't popular, meaning alternatives to the popular players on the market. So ideally there'd be several options. > At a certain point I wonder if people have considered that the Edwards/Data driven approach may have even been part of the problem?   Given our success with transfers, and the fact we've been a successful side while run sustainably, it's hard to argue with the approach. Are they stupid? So that's where the 115 charges stem from. I had to actually run the alphabet through my mind to make sure I was not having a stroke after reading this thread... Vintage sherry this one The confidence is unmatched to this day.  Not a reliable rumour. Lol we'll believe it when it happens, so never. You don't need 30 signings on 7 year contracts to mitigate a one year ban. 114 to catch up to you lot. Cum inside What is the context for this I Think they may also be banking on player inflation They are signing a bunch of youngsters at < 20 M and hoping that the going base Value will be come 25 million. Yeah but they surely wont want to sell the ones who's value has increased? Like logically they will only want to sell the players who's value has decreased?  Otherwise what's the point of all this if you need to sell the players who have improved to make it financially viable?  It seems to me (and someone please correct me if I'm wrong cos I feel like I must be) that in order for this strategy to work, Chelsea will need to sell some of their best players in a few years time. The bad ones will be worth less than they paid for them, so in order to break even they'll have to sell some of the good ones as well? I Think they may also be banking on player inflation They are signing a bunch of youngsters at < 20 M and hoping that the going base Value will be come 25 million. This feels like VC strategy. Have a bunch of small bets, lose many on the vast majority but a handful of dramatic successes still puts you ahead.     Only these aren't small bets they're making. I think the vast majority are going out on loan and are Chelsea's only in name. Average FM save with a top 6 club i would not say they are that bad at selling still dont get how they sold havertz and mount for the ammount of money they did.      and they always could sell there star boy in palmer... everytime they hit a 40m transfer like that its insane how much breathing room it gives them. Counterpoint: it's not going that great at the moment, but if they can make it work it'll be like a free money glitch, getting cash only acting as intermediaries. Because they had a champions league squad and completely fumbled any and all chemistry they had? lol all these words to say it’s not going to work unless it works. Thanks, Michael Owen. And then lose to Real Madrid in the quarter final and get fucked by some random penalty offered to Man City 3 weeks before the end of the season while being denied the exact same penalty 4 months ago.  And just like that they have a net loss that they can't do shit about next year, no one to sell, no money to buy because FFP is watching.   Chelsea's business model is risky but it works. they are shit in the field, but financially i think they are well run. This feels too much like Chelsea are banking on the insecurities of players who have nothing when they're just starting their life, much like traders banking on weak economies and disasters to happen to get their sweet profits. Yeah, it's not weird to prioritize money if you're a player who makes the same amount of money as an average office worker since a footballers career is short. It's weird to sacrifice playing time over money if you're already making 250k a week instead of 350k a week. Whatever, I’m just saying it’s senseless to feel for their financial health for not having a career after this when they are so much better off than you. > Might as well maximize it then for them when they won't be making that money once they retire   You're replying to someone who said players will make more than the majority of people will in their entire LIFE, and your answer is that they need to milk it because players won't make money in their retirement? Then whyvare they not going to the Saudis? But isn’t Jaime saying in the video that the contracts are what’s causing the footballing issues? If you’re business plan is to horde promising young players so you can sell them when they appreciate in value (similar to how a rich person might invest in apartment buildings in London), then you’re completely fucking off any semblance of team cohesion or philosophy. Thus, any manager is disempowered and any player who truly gives a shit is disempowered. Low and behold, the football sucks (and the players don’t appreciate as much as they could) Isn’t the irony in all this is that they are having low value contracts, with the intention of increasing their value sufficiently to profit off them. Yet, their value cannot increase without playing time? Most professional footballers would bite their hand off at Chelsea's 7 year deals. The truly elite players won't sign there because they want money and shorter deals so they can constantly renew for a pay bump.    There's a reason their 3 largest buys have been; a guy with 6 months Euro experience in Portugal, a so far 1 season star from Brighton and a pacey Ukrainian from a league players were allowed to cancel their own contracts to escape because of the war.    Cole Palmer has been the only signing that's lived up to or exceeded the transfer fee and he only took 1 year to get a 50% pay bump and will want another if he repeats last season. Sure, lovely houses out there and that, but in London you have quick access to literally anything you want.   The house you linked is the kind of house a rich person would buy when they want to wind down and take it easy. A young 20-something year old footballer isn't gonna want to live on a country estate. > I hear this non-stop, do people really think that the player signing for Liverpool, Manchester United/City or idk any fucking club outside of London live in some run down shitty districts?  No, no one said other places outside London are run down, shitty districts. You've made this up in your head and chosen to get angry about it.  As I said in another comment, while there are lovely houses elsewhere and nice victorian mansions around the country. 20-something year old footballers are unlikely to want to live in on nice country estates like this, away from the ""action"". It’s kind of like what the Atlanta Braves in the MLB are doing. They are signing young players after 1-2 good years for salaries that look amazing if the player continues to improve but also gives players financial stability for the rest of their lives. I was referring to u/TheGoldenPineapples comment where ""Novelty"" wears off, I was just agreeing with them ... my point is at some point some of them may want to actually do something with their career than ""secure the bag"" Theoretically yeah, but they don't need many failures for it to go wrong with the amount of transfer amortisation. > You only need one kid per year group to become like Reece James, Colwill, Chalobah, Solanke, Tomori, Maatsen, Guehi, Mount, Livramento, RLC, Hall, Gilmour.  To be fair, they've had to sell Gallagher, RLC, Hutchison, Maatsen, Mount, CHO and (soon) Chalobah in the last 12 months just to help sustain this suspending. So they're gonna need a lot more than just one kid per year panning out.   I've no doubt they can keep finding players to sell, but they've nearly gutted the established homegrown (pure PSR profit) elements of the team over the last 2-3 years, so it starts getting harder now. With so many players in their squad, I wonder if there will come a time when talented youngsters start preferring other academies where they have a chance of first-team football. Talents at that level will typically have offers from a few academies. It sure does leave with enough. But what if you want more? You know whats better than giving your mom a house? Giving your mom a mansion. Better than putting your kids in private school? Putting in the top private school. Make your kids don't have to worry about money? Making your grandkids don't worry about money. People always want more.  And are you taking into account that loads of players injury themself and don't comeback at top level? What now, back to lower level salary? Are you taking acount that sometimes people break form and their value drops? How many players do you know that can mantain 7 years of top level, playing regulary? Very few, most fizzle out and are back to lower teams and salaries. What about loans? Have you though that even if you don't play in the club that bought you you can be loaned and still play AND have tons of money?  There's a reason why tons of players are signning with Chelsea. Rejecting top salaries for 7 years is an enormous bet on yourself. You are saying, I think I'm worth the same in 3-4 years. Guess what, most players aren't. Stop with your facts, there’s bullshit narratives to spread here. Most of your post is cherry picked but this:  > Palmer, after his new extension will make a total of 60m base salary over 9 years.   The idea that he's locked into this 60m base for 9 years is clearly bogus given Palmer already had an 8 year contract until 2031, but after one season you upped his wages by another 50k and extended it to 2033. He'll probably get another 50-100k within the next 24 months too. > Once again, look at the salaries. Palmer, after his new extension will make a total of 60m base salary over 9 years. Now compare that to Sancho who will make 65m over his 5 years at United, Grealish who will make 78m over 5 years at City and Havertz who will make 72,8m at Arsenal.  In hindsight, I get the comparison, but the situations with Palmer joining Chelsea versus those players joining their new clubs, minus maybe Havertz (more on par with Palmer), are completely different. Grealish and Sancho were considered top players available in the market in the world when they made their moves. Comparing the breakout of the last season to 2 players widely condemned as failed transfers seems fair. If Palmer doesn't renew for another pay bump in the next 18 months then it's because he's a 1 season wonder or gets a horrific injury. The long deals give Chelsea security in selling for a decent fee but if the players play well then they will keep getting new deals or will force their way out.    Sancho, Grealish and Havertz had all proven themselves far more in the moves your referencing that Palmer had at City so they arent exactly comparable. Grealish was one of the best wingers in the country and went for more than double Palmer cost you, it's not surprise he far out earns Palmer. Yeah I mean Shakhtar’s director even confirmed Arsenal bid the same amount as us for Mudryk they just put harder to achieve add ons in the deal. Sure that’s a difference but it’s not like they weren’t willing to spend on him for example > Everyone would take that deal.  Plenty of people wouldn't and haven't. But I don't blame the ones who have too much. They also bet on themselves to distinguish themselves in the squad, even as unlikely as that might seem to us on the outside. You are delusional  Chelsea arent offering “low wages”  If you can get an extra 3 years of guaranteed money it’s a huge difference  125k a week for 5 years vs 100k a week for 8 years is a substantial difference. 8 year contract is 9.1 million more in wages You’re delulu, it’s only about the money And? I don’t think many teams stand any chance, and probably none that aren’t Real Madrid or Man City. These guys aren’t just going for money. In fact the wages Chelsea are handing out are far less than the likes of United, City or Liverpool are paying. Players are not going to Chelsea solely for money. Who apart from City or Madrid is ? We have been utter shit by our own standards but we reached a final last season and a semi final. But a lot of people confuse the two and will compare 155k a week to someone elses 250k with all bonuses included and say Palmer is underpaid. That is why the distinction is important. I mean, they both literally had the chance to join Liverpool and didn’t, even though the wages being offered were lower at Chelsea i would find project with guaranteed  8 year salary more appealing too Dont go through my search history or will will see me disagreeing about how Gallagher was sold just for money reason to fund more buys.   Yes i have. Sadly its on Reddit so some of what i came across where defending it.   But my Chelsea loving uncle thinks the ownership  , and i sorta quote here, 'a bunch of fucking idiots with no idea what they are doing' . I tend to agree. Does it really count as more injuries if you have 65 players? Anyone downvoting my previous comment about are Chelsea fans happy about whats happening please please refer to who i am replying to.  Some seem to be delighted.     (Edit also this > We are trying to buy young players with potential, let them develop and grow together, and try to compete for the title next year. It’s really not that hard to understand     Really is in response to this > They may end up with a sold first team and make idk top four at some point. The idea is to then sell all those players ( my understanding is they are run by investors? even Eghabli is one? ) for big profit, bring int he next round of young players and rinse and repeat forever.  Ok maybe win the title then sell and rinse and repeat. Your trying to disagree tht i dont understand when i clearly do. ) 1 billion pound squad to get conference league  “guys how can you think this project is failing so far” > We are trying to buy young players with potential, let them develop and grow together, and try to compete for the title next year.    And yet, when you sell players like Mount and Gallagher to sign Dewsbury-Hall it will always be 'next year' when you'll be ready to compete.    > You may disagree with it, but it’s clear what we are trying to do.    Is it? Arsenal bought young and rebuilt the team. It took Arteta 3.5 seasons to compete at the top and we've spent far less than you.    > Oh and we finished above you last year, with more injuries, so it’s not like the process has failed so far.   The club has gone backwards from when Boehly took over, I would call that a success. It has literally been the strategy of chelsea before BlueCo ever existed. During the Roman days and the «loan army» they had more than 40 players out on loan at the same time. The players got the club loan fees, and eventually most of them was sold to turn even more profit.  Sure this strategy right now is a bit off the grid though as the fees they pay for some of the players are completely different to what Roman did. But to say it has never been done successfully before when it in fact is in Chelseas DNA to do it is just false. We literally made a profit on Havertz lol, he was bought for 70m by us and sold for 65m 3 years later. His book value would’ve been around 25m at the time he was sold as he had 2 years left. Moreria, Hutchinson, Maatsen and hall all out this window for over £100m profit with 2 weeks left and many more to come Of course a dumbass like you would bring up players that were bought before the new ownership (or more precisely the new sporting directors). Go sit down somewhere. He’s famous for his spitting He’s *spitting* facts [yes](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12169388.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Screen_Shot_2017-12-26_at_092508-1-copy.jpg) he ain't the sharpest tool in the shed either, yea All of which require registration which is capped at 25 players, hence 3 getting zero minutes. FA Cup is the exception and you might get 1 game in that. Means someone who played for multiple clubs ? Carra doesn’t seem to fit that bill per se. What do you think it means? Players that move around a lot throughout their career Considering it contains the word journey it would imply they move around a lot, which Carra didn't as he didn't do that.    Chelsea's loan army are all journeymen, playing in all of the FL and across Europe until their value hits profitable level and they're sold. Zubimendi is the opposite of not popular. Multiple big clubs tried to sign him Let's sing it together! A Z E T B V D That’s why I said it’s a rumor. I’ve just seen it said on Reddit I don’t have a source to cite. Ohhh. So it's okay to cheat, but only once? I got it. Thanks. It's a safe day There are a number of people on tiktok who are imitating fabrizio's style for announcing football transfers, substituting the ""here we go"" with different phrases such as ""there we land"", ""here we skidaddle"", etc. 100% this. The entire strategy is built on the assumption that market values will continue to see inflation.  I'm guessing they're not thinking about who can do good for their team, i think they're looking at players like financial commodities, buy low sell high would be the plan.  Think about Gallagher, i think they're just happy to get a surplus on him. Maybe they think they're going to make a lot of money on this player market and then they'll just pocket the difference? Or maybe they'll build a big warchest and spend it in say... 10 years? They won't sell the ones like Palmer who's value significantly increased,  but is a locked in starter.  They will sell ones like Madu whose value has increased but he isn't going to beat out Palmer.   Ian Maatsen is a good example of the strategy. They're betting on inflation long term, and with amortization, you don't need players value to increase. If someone is bought for 40m over 5 years, it's 8m less per year needed to break even financially. So if it's 3 years later and the player sells for 20m, it's actually a profit on the books. If they sell them for 40m, it would be 24m profit.  The way amortisation works means that they can sell for less than they paid and still technically record a profit in the year the player is sold. Example below:  They buy a player for £50m. That fee is spread out across a 5 year period when Chelsea file their accounts. So they record an expenditure of £10m each year for this player, and each year the ‘book value’ of that player goes down £10m. After 3 years that player is *technically* worth £20m. When they sell him for £35m it looks to everyone like they made a loss but as far as that year’s accounts go they just made a £15m profit on the sale of an asset.  Why is this allowed? It’s because the cost of footballers is recorded as a ‘capital asset’ and the cost is therefore spread out over the expected life of that asset (the length of the contract) in the same way as when a company buys a van they spread the cost of it over the 5 years they expect that van to last them.  Obviously it doesn’t work this way in reality. You can’t endlessly lose money on players and still expect to remain a viable business but Chelsea are clearly banking on extra money coming in from increased TV revenue, prize money, sponsorships and/or an eventual sale to another investor, where all those losses get swallowed up. My strategy there was always to buy decent players cheap, loan them out for a season or two then sell for a profit. But that only works when you're not spending that much up front. To be frank many of Chelsea signing are young player so most likely their wages got triple or more for many of them people forget that just 1 contract is gonna make them enough money to live comfortably for the rest of their lives. And they get 3 of these at least in their careers. If youre with Chelsea I guess you only get 2 but should be more than enough. He said might as well, not need, ones arguing it wouldnt be a bad idea to maximize their profits, youre saying they dont need to. Those are both valid points that can co-exist Ya why not maximize how much money you can make in the prime years of your life? Boo hoo they make more than us. Are you saying that you wouldn't try to make the most money in the same situation? Shit place to live. They get to live in London instead. I'm not arguing for the philosophy of our squad building and talent hoarding.  I'm just saying I think there's a bit of misunderstanding going around as to why our contracts are structured the way that they are. People think we're handing out generational or disproportionate fortunes to every player when a quick search of transfermkt or the reporting of reputable sources will show to our best knowledge that it's not the case for many of our acquisitions.  The management have (imo correctly) identified that the major bottleneck for selling isn't contract length but wages. Players with lower weekly wage will open up the number of participating teams in the buying market.   There are so many things about the club currently where the more I see it the more I'm like, this just keeps getting worse, what are they doing. On the other hand, the contracts have been something where I was absolutely baffled by in the beginning, but have slowly come around to understanding why they've done what they've done.  I'll take these 7 yr contracts any day over Lukaku for 300k a week on a 4 yr deal, Sterling 250k a week on a 4 yr deal etc etc. The latter is way riskier. [deleted] Quick access to Heathrow to fly, quite literally, to any single part of the world you want.  Also let's not act like Cobham, Surrey isn't one of the nicest parts of England to live in lol. Doesn't beat cheshire though There are tons of players that are young and already have a wife + kids. Not everyone wants to live that party life lol. But in US sports once the contract is signed they are locked in. In Europe with football players can demand a new contract at will, as Cole Palmer has shown. Chelsea are taking the baseball approach to contracts but if any of the players actually live up to their transfer fees then Chelsea will be paying them big wages.    The amount of money they are spending on signings is unsustainable if they aren't top 4 every year. lol they've already made it, against all odds. What more is there to do...? IMO The kids making those decisions are so young (16 for scholars) that they will assume most of the new signings will be old senior pros or gone by the time they get there. Plus by that age most of them are attached to the club and it’s local to them so not much incentive to leave - especially if there’s a whole stream of ex-Chelsea academy kids going for big money to other good clubs. That’s a fan perspective right?   The academy isn’t there to produce Chelsea starters so much as it is there to produce professional footballers and maximize their talent and value.   Easy to argue that over the last ten years going through Cobham is beneficial to a professional player whether they ever get a minute for Chelsea or not.   The leagues are littered with Cobham boys and that’s a hell of a good reason to consider Cobham at 8-11 years old for a local kid.   If I had an 8 year old son living in London and Cobham knocks. I’m jumping on that immediately. Yeah, some people will always want more, nothing stops them from prioritizing money over playing time. But most professional footballers who have made it to the top level of the sport don't prioritize making slightly more money over not being able to play any football at all.  And yes, the people who injure themselves and drop off in form will go to lower league wages. Those wages in question are still several, several times more than what an average person makes unless they somehow go from playing at a Premier League level to a League 2-National League level, which pretty much only happens if it's a career ending injury.  And no, most people don't want to be constantly loaned out, that's one of the worst scenarios a professional football player can be in.  >Rejecting top salaries for 7 years is an enormous bet on yourself  We're not discussing players who reject ""top level wages"". We're discussing players who have the choice to sign for several other Premier League clubs who pay among the highest wages in Europe, but the difference being the contract length. Please stop using this kind of though-terminating cliche. It's a wart on Reddit. It's cheaper yes. But I do wonder how Chelsea players on year 4 of a 7 year deal don't kick up a fuss for a bump. These are the personalities you guys are attracting, one big name guy comes to the club and earns 4x or 5x all the sudden you guys are gonna have 4-5 guys all demand a new deal or be shipped off. 'Facts' require references. I could pull unsubstantiated numbers out of my ass too, it certainly wouldn't make me right, and you'd be just as stupid to agree with me as you are this person. Yes, they will get salary bumps if they deserve it obviously. Personally I think this is way better than a high starting salary.  Palmer is not an exception to the rule, I'm just using him as an example because he recently renewed. If you look at our other signings, you can see that we clearly do not offer base salaries nearly as high as United, City and Abramovich's Chelsea. If that was the case everyone would be in the Saudi league. Yeah because it's an 8 year deal  So more money guaranteed in total Both were offered higher wages at Liverpool and rejected them Eh, online fans barely count. I've had to explain to users here why fans of a club might have a stronger emotional connection to academy players than their latest big money signing. Nobody I know who has actually seen the Bridge is excited about the squad or the signings right now. It does when u consider the majority of players who would’ve been picked first on the team sheet missed basically All last year. Nkunku, Reece, fofAnA, Chilwell/cucu, Enzo , even gusto missed A long spell. We were plying with Alfie Gilchrist out of position because we had so many injuries Make 165 and then it might start to sound funny. Chelsea's squad last season was in line with other top 6 clubs with significantly higher matches lost due to injury. I’m not delighted. But it’s just disingenuous to be like “what’s the plan?” When the plan is incredibly obvious. It’s vAlid to criticize it if it’s not working well, but that is the plan. Because the one billion was spent in an effort to compete for major trophies within 3 to 5 years. Not immediately. We had been spending like crazy for years and never came close to competing for the league against them or Liverpool since 2017. Like we spent over 100m on players that are still in South America lol. We also sold like 300 mil worth of players too Sold Mount and replaced him with Palmer, a younger better player. 60m for Mount in the last year of his contract.   Gallagher refused to sign two contract offers. Club doesn’t want to lose him for free.   Arsenal have spent close to a billion with Arteta and have one FA cup to show for it. In that time frame, Chelsea have won the Champions league lol. If you buy something for £70m, pay him millions in wages and sell him for £65m that isn't a profit 😂 Moreira wasn't a profit, you bought him for £2m and sold him for the same:   [https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/diego-moreira/profil/spieler/655006](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/diego-moreira/profil/spieler/655006)  Maatsen you've had since he was a youth player in 2018, counting someone that was there before the ""strategy"" existed isn't a sign that the strategy is working.  Hall is again a youth player, if you're having to sell your own home grown players to finance this it's not a sign the system is working.  Hutchinson is another that's on paper a profit but again, it's a pre-Todd youth player.  Chelsea have spent over a billion on players and 3 of the 4 players you cite as the spending being an investment and working are from before Todd arrive and the other you broken even on.  I don't get it? Am I missing something...  Chelsea are acting well outside the range of what you would expect a club to do, which means:  1. They are doing something genius that no one has ever thought of doing.  2. They are doing something stupid.  I see no evidence of option 1. Ok so Chelsea have spent a shit load of money on talent with an idea to develop and sell, fair enough. At least we have identified that's their plan...  Which players do you think they will make a profit on based on current form? Wasn't aware of it, fair enough Journeyman actually has different meanings apparently. The American English version is just someone that always reliable but not exceptional, and the reliability factor I’ve always heard applied to people who have been loyal and around for a long time. What I'm trying to say is their data driven approach should show them more options than what's popular on the market, instead of making them focused on the statistically best option, which is evidently whT's happening. Popular but still a value opportunity because of his release clause and no rival bidders in this window. Ah, I see you are French! Hats off to you, sir! >I'm guessing they're not thinking about who can do good for their team  Disagree. The team winning increases the value of their team and players.   They want to win.   Gallagher is a perfect example of the strategy. As good of a player he is, his value is in the money they can get for him. He isn't a locked in stater in a jammed position, so they will sell him to get the profit to buy Felix and Neto on amortization years. how they gonna get value on players bought for so much money that's what i don't get. buy high sell higher? sounds risky Mudryk for 100 mil is buy low sell high? Ian Maatsen was an academy player, not one who they signed. That’s not how it works at all. They still owe the club they bought him from £16m - the amortized fee doesn’t just disappear into thin air. I'm pretty sure they know that, but that they can't fathom that there are people who care about more things in life than making as much money as possible  So many of them talk about how stupid the millionaire footballers are for not chasing even bigger contracts and more money because they themselves would do it. Yeah, no shit you would since you're broke. > Those are both valid points that can co-exist  Said need instead of might, who cares? My point was that the response was irrelevant to the OPs comment - I don't care what the players do. I'm saying your point was an irrelevant response. I don't give a fuck what they do with their careers. Ah I see. Thanks for the explanation I'll help you out a little, there's 72 professional sides in divisions below the Premier League alone, every single one of those players would jump at the contracts Chelsea are handing out. 72x25 is much larger than 20x25 from the Prem alone.    Then we go outside the Prem and there's maybe 10-15 clubs on par with Chelsea and everyone else worse. From all those other clubs, players would jump at Chelsea's offers.    Professional players don't end at the Prem and champions league. Phenomenal services, Cobham. Worth signing your soul to ~~The Devil~~ Eghbali for that alone. I've never been to the place, so idk, but if the best argument that it is nice is that you get away fast, it doesn't sound convincing. Yea, when you have 1-2 weeks in Jan, and a couple weeks during summer you don't need an airport like this.  Not to mention that You can rent a private jet pretty much anywhere in the world. Yeah, players with wife & kids have never been seen acting wild. Sure, no one said otherwise. We're talking about why some players will always be attracted to Chelsea: i.e., big wages, long contracts, and based in London. In theory baseball contracts are locked in but in reality any superstar can hold out and ask for a new contract, similar to Cole Palmer. It just doesn’t happen as often because of the way arbitration works. The Braves are doing things that haven’t really been done before. Win something?! Do something meaningful in your career you can look back on maybe? >We're not discussing players who reject ""top level wages"". We're discussing players who have the choice to sign for several other Premier League clubs who pay among the highest wages in Europe, but the difference being the contract length.  Yes we are. Rejecting top salaries for 7 years in favour of just 3 or 4 is rejecting garanteed money. You don't know if you are getting a same level contract after those 3-4 years and most players in fact don't get them.  And if you are right why do players keep signing with Chelsea? Why players are rejecting Liverpool and other top level clubs to sign with Chelsea? Caicedo? Lavia? Neto? Enzo? Jackson? And so much more. All of them had interest from other top level clubs, why did they choose Chelsea? Maybe reality is going against your proposition no? Cliches still have a role. I hate using “reddit phrases” tbh and don’t often do it but it’s genuinely bullshit how some narratives which are false get peddled and upvoted on here. That should be what you have more of an issue with but ok All football wage and transfer fee numbers are reported by various sources, which will obviously vary with reliability but will for the most part will be reported by people who have links to agents and clubs and so will be pretty accurate. You’re acting like these numbers are gonna be wildly off when that’s just not the case. Also, people love pulling unsubstantiated numbers out their fucking arse when chatting about Chelsea all the time. But more more importantly, the crux of that guys point is correct regardless. Palmer is an exception to the 3 you named. He was nowhere near as accomplished as any of those 3 when he joined Chelsea, that's why he left City for less money and on lower wages.     Signing unproven youngsters on low salaries applies to you signing Palmer. It does not apply to Sancho, Grealish or Havertz. Or they would rather live in London and play for Chelsea like they said But not an 8 year deal Lavia was just pure pettiness I mean tbh im more likeley to trust my uncles opinion then random Reddit user.   He has been a fan since idk the 70s or so.  But my general experience is the Reddit fanbase defending this shite. Dont get me wrong i think its hilarious, and il throw banter all day at yis.   ITs a speed run of the Glazers, so i still feel sympathy ofc.   But that Carra quote of where will he even get changed hits hard. i mean he is not wrong at all. I literally outlined my understanding of 'the plan' in what you responded to. Did you read my comment? ?????????? is that really the plan? It seems to me that the plan is to stack those young players, maybe send them on loan and hope they develop and then sell them for profit. Some of those unkown dudes that were signed last year are already being sold this year. Its impossible to build a young core if you are buying everythig that has two legs. > Chelsea have won the Champions league lol.    Roman won that mate, Boehly has won fuck all and spent billions getting there. That's the comparison being made.    If you want to wank over the bygone days of Roman's ownership be my fucking guest, you ain't getting back there anytime soon if ever. It’s come out in recent days that Moreira was actually sold for 8m, I’m sure there was shenanigans with that one. They’ve been here a year and a half at most. Why would they be looking to make profit on them? But if I have to answer your stupid question then anyone from Jackson to Palmer to Madueke down to Gusto and Petrovic to name just a few. Heck mandem could sell Paez right now for double the fee and he hasn’t even step foot on the pitch for us.      It’s one thing to not understand but there’s no need to talk out of your ass on clubs you apparently know nothing about. I wouldn’t go around chatting shit about whatever tf united are doing cuz I know I definitely do not know more than the fans that actually follow the club and pay attention to all their dealings.      You’re the type to tell the fan of another club that their player or manager is good/bad when they who watch them every week are telling you otherwise but you’re too self absorbed to listen to people that clearly know more about the subject… and you’re not the only genius of this ilk unfortunately. He has 500 league apps alone before he turned 35, if he didn't excel he wouldn't even reach half of that. No it means you get passed around like a pack of cigarettes in prison I just use fmscout. Beret off to you too Very risky, they're gambling on there being a greater fool out there. No, that was light money on fire Still works perfectly well as an example of a player whose value increases over a year or two but still gets sold Just saw this now. I'm pretty sure that is how it works. The selling club typically gets paid immediately. The buying club finances the transfer through a bank. They then pay the bank in installments and it's financed over an agreed upon length of time with interest. That's how it's amortized. Youre exactly right, like sure I GUESS having 1 billion dollars from kicking a football for 4 years must be very fun (like the contract that was offered to Vini) but the glory is priceless (or at least it should be). Need = necessity   Might as well = suggest something with little drawbacks or negatives   His comment was plenty relevant. Why should someone leave more money on the table just because? If they wanted to sign their souls to ""The Devils"", wouldn't they sign for yous lot? Lol Access to the biggest airport in the world isn't a negative lol.  You can live in the best part of England and still want an easy getaway to Dubai/ Greece/ Miami or wherever.  Not exactly the sunniest country in the world lol. Footballers aren't renting private jets lol.  Maybe as a one-off but come on be serious.  Who is paying 300k to fly to Miami and back in a private jet when you can go first class for like 3k?  😂😂😂 They can look back in the rear-view mirror of their 3rd Ferrari. They already play at one of the top club in the world. You know only 1% of the 1% of pro wins the league or euro cups right? They are living the dream, not everyone is Ronaldo or Messi. Theres still a chance they can do that at Chelsea, but also when you have the opportunity to achieve generational wealth, it trivializes any personal ambitions. Offering 200k over 4 years is the same as 100k over 8 years, so unless we know what the actual salaries are then it's a pointless discussion.  >And if you are right why do players keep signing with Chelsea?   Because I said most players and not all players. Some of them believe in Chelseas project, some of them believe in themselves to get significant playing time, some of them just want the long contract. You're literally listening to a former top level player, Carragher, talk about this very thing and he doesn't agree with you. Except now time has passed since your comment and the parent comment has 33 upvotes. Yet this summer after proving himself he still agreed to a contract that will see him get paid around half of those players.  If you look at Nkunku who is a close comparison to those 3 players, he's still paid significantly less than them, while being (I believe?) the highest paid signing under Clearlake. Yeah could be  I mean I don't believe the comments that they were convinced of the project as there clearly isn't one or there is a new one every season We were following him all season and he has a good relationship with Joe shields. For one, you edited the comment after I responded…… and secondly, your understanding is nonsensical and driven by media narrative. We aren’t looking to sell players  as soon as they become good or we would’ve sold Palmer already lol. We don’t have to sell those players because if they are on long, incentive driven contracts. The better they ply, they better they’ll be paid. It just happened with Palmer. The long contracts are given to avoid rudiger / Christensen situation where the previous owners let them walk for free Yes that’s really the plan. See Palmer, Madueke , Caicedo, Enzo , lavia, Nkunku, Jackson, gusto. All very young. aLl important players. Firstly this is reddit, you are very welcome to go round chatting shit about any club you wish.   Secondly, if the strategy of Todd is buying players, developing them and then profiting it's perfectly valid to ask if that's working. Especially when he's put so much of your clubs cash on the table over it.  With the one exception of Palmer, I don't see evidence of this working. You've spent a billion and Palmer is the only player I genuinely think you could have a major profit from and he's a £80m player. You need another 25 of him to claw back that billion. But thats a normal strategy for most clubs. Buy low and young, then sell high. But what of the Enzos and Mudryks if they dont work out? Who is gonna pay back the same value for those players if they dont pan out? These people seem to think that it's just chance that determines who makes it to the highest level of the most popular sport on the planet by a huge margin, and not a result of wanting to play football and win more than anything, and grinding an ungodly amount since they're children. His comment was relevant how? It's a non sequitur. It's shifting the topic from the income disparity between footballers and the average person, to promoting maximisation of income before retirement.  We are also replying to a video which disproves his point about footballers not making 'that money' once they retire.  Also, I didn't need definitions, but thanks. Agreed that footballers aren't doing it regularly, but for 300k you are pretty much looking at chartering a commercial jet.   You can get a small Gulfstream trans-Atlantic for way under 100k, still silly money when first class is less hassle. >Offering 200k over 4 years is the same as 100k over 8 years, so unless we know what the actual salaries are then it's a pointless discussion.  But they aren't beign offered 100k in 7 years are they? To take your example they are offered 150k/week for 8 years vs 200k/week for 4 years. So they are beign offered more garanteed money. That's why they are going with Chelsea, otherwise Chelsea contracts would be terrible (same money but more years) I'm also seeing current top level players keep signing with Chelsea and rejecting other big clubs so what? Cucurella and Caicedo didn't agree with Carragher for sure. Top level players keep saying ""nah I want the garanteed 7 year contract"".  It's easy to say ""back yourself"" when you aren't taking the risks. Carragher definitly backed himself during his carrer but maybe other players don't like to take as many risk if presented with an safe option. And the one that started this thread has over 1000? They don't remember how the club put in a similar bid for him the summer before I edited my response yo your response. I also wuoted your response and mine and yet you still disagree?   And yes the new owners dont want player to leave for free and want to make money by forcing them out.   Its possibly even happening now with Sterling but i dont know much other then the few PR stuff.  The plan that you and I both agree on is to bring in young players maybe get top four or win a trophy. Sell for profit and bring in the next batch that they have alreayd bought.   Same way Brighton does but they have a better scouting network and dont spend nearly1.3 billion on youth players to all have in the squad at the same time.   Brighton replace the players more 'organically' those were all very well known talents and i dont think many people have anything to say about those signigs. Its the uknown kids that they are signing for 20 million with absolutely no path to the first team that everyone finds confusing. You’d have to be dumb af to believe the nonsense you just typed. The strategy is not to just make profit off players. This isn’t some feeder club here. And to say palmer is the only one we could make a major profit on? Stupidity at its near finest. If that’s the case then no club can make profit off any player then cuz there’s not many better than him both in initial price and ability. And I just gave you names that could be sold for a significant profit right now but of course you being a know it all definitely knows more about them than I do for sure.      And then you talk of “a billion spent” like it’s so funny how you idiots choose to ignore any sales that have been made by the club, it’s only what was bought cuz the little change from the player sales every window is all imaginary and doesn’t matter. Don’t worry, by next year it’ll be 2 billion and then 3 billion a few years after that. Man gtfoh. There is still a gigantic chance portion to it. Genetics and environmental factors are just as important as your work ethic. His response was not a non sequitur. Some players want to maximize their income while they can, because they can earn a ton of money. Its irrelevant that they already have a lot of money, if they want all they can get thats fine I assume that price is one-way trip still.  I was assuming 150k for 2 legs but I must say it's very much an estimate as it isn't a price estimate at the front of my mind lol.  Realistically, if footballer is exclusively flying chartered, he is going to end up broke sooner than later unless he is CR7/ Messi lol. We don't know what they're being offered which makes the discussion pointless. There are lots of players who values the stability of long term contracts even if the money is the same or worse. I wouldn't call any of those players top level yet. Carragher's argument is that if you're a player that backs yourself to continue on progressing, a 4 year contract is what you should be looking for, instead of 7 or 8 years at a club whose project I will kindly call unproven currently. Take Palmer, the closest thing they have to a bonafide star whose stock is rising. 2 or 3 more years of him doing what he has been doing while the club doesn't match his ability, he is going to start agitating to go and win shit. Except he will have zero leverage to move. Chelsea will hold all the cards, asking for 9 figure sums that clubs are much more reluctant to spend these days with PSR. That's the level of player Carragher is talking about. Not two lads who signed from Brighton. Well, if we can get back on the topic after dealing with the non-falsifiable waffle, it's still right. How hard is the 7th backup keeper working for his money? Yes, we want to have ready made replacements if players want to leave, that’s just good planning. But we aren’t simply going to sell the players once the team starts to win trophies. Thats where we disagree. The goal is to build a team that can compete for multiple years. Not torn down at the first success to maximize  profit. That’s another advantage of the long contracts, players can’t run down their contracts or push for a move with more than 2 years left on their deal. Chelsea has always let players leave if they want to; but the long contracts preserve their value. So go on , name them. Carney has been good whenever he plays, but struggles with injuries. Santos and ugochukwe on loan. We missed on like 3 or 4 young players. That’s not outrageous You can cry about what I'm saying all you like.  Buy in all your whining you've not proven me wrong. Obviously, that's not what I mean by chance. I mean they don't grab any random person off the street to give a multi million dollar contract to, which these people seem to think when they're talking about how professional footballers don't want to play football and would rather sit and do nothing. > Its irrelevant that they already have a lot of money  Alright, thanks for agreeing with me. What? So a player prefers to receive 10M in 8 years instead of receiving 10M in 4? Why? They can go play in lower clubs after 4 years and still make more money. That doesn't make any sense, of course Chelsea are giving them more money overall.  Also Caicedo salary is around 7.8M/year if you search online. Jota and Núñez salaries (which are similar level players I would say) are around 7.2M/year. Now do the math. You think Nuñez and Jota are renewing with more money that would make a difference? They are top level. They are starters in Chelsea which is one of the best clubs in the world and both are starters for their national teams. Only 1% of top level players get to Carragher level. It's insane to mold your carrer as the 1% of 1%.  I don't necessarily disagree with Carragher. if you want to back yourself up do it. Its a risk, if you can mantain form great if not you loose out on money. But what if Palmer gets an ACL injury? What if he doesn't hold form? Lot's of ifs and players of course take this in account.   Great username btw If you’re a player who backs himself, you sign any deal you want. Clubs will want to sign you regardless. It’s that simple. The 6th and 7th choice keepers are academy lads who are undoubtedly not on much money at all. push for a move no. But down tools and not give a shite ofc they can. Why would they care they have a guarneteed pay day for the next 7 or so years.   There are 6? First team GKs? whats the plans there??? Rotate every few months>? OR hope one performs well and sell him on then bring in the next one? Again Rinse and Repeat for return on investment. omari kellyman was like 25 million and i struggle to see him break into the team when you have 20 attackers. Then you have angelo, david washington, fofana, casedei, veiga, about five goalkeepers,... You cant tell me those arent weird signings. They are assets who will be sent on loan with a hope of securing a profit. We can't name them because you signed so many and they all suck or don't play so it's hard to keep up. Palmer is your only success and that was somewhat expected. You signed Wnzo and Caicedo with everyone expecting you to have a powerhouse CM duo and it's anything but that. How have I not proven the guy that says Palmer is the only person in the squad that can be sold for a profit or that the club is only trying to buy players in order to make profit wrong? Thats not what your point was but if you insist on acting like a knob be my guest I guess You're fundamentally misunderstanding the discussion. If you're a player that backs themselves, you want to be able to come to the negotiating table again in a few years to wither A) Get a pay upgrade with your new contract or B) move to another club because your current club isn't matching your ambition/talent. When you sign an 8 year deal, you lose all leverage entirely. You're at the whims of the club now. Go take a look at what hapoend to Scottie Pippin in the NBA when he signed a long contract. Within 5 or 6 years he was one of the worst paid players in the league as salaries grew around him, despite being arguably the second best. When he went to talk to the club about renegotiating they pointed to the years left on his contract and told him tough shit. That is a realistic scenario for some of these Chelsea players. In this example, the team has just won a few trophies and now players are going to down tools? Even if they get raised wages? Come on now. The GK situation is a mess I’ll admit Angelo is likely going to be sold for a profit, just like Diego Morreira. Fofana was one of the highest rated young defenders in the world when he was purchased lol you can say we overpaid but it definitely wasn’t a “weird” signing.   Veiga was bought like two weeks ago and literally played on Sunday. Obviously he is going to get a lot of minutes this season as he is the backup LB…..   I agree with you on Deveid Washington and the keeper situation.  Casadei again was one of italys best young talents, not a “weird” signing.   Kellyman was obviously a PSR swap with Villa for Maatsen.    So again , we missed on 3 or 4 young players. Is it really that crazy?   And yes, there are some signings that are purely for business and will never play for Chelsea , which is literally what we did for a decade under Roman. We literally had a loan army with 40+ guys, most of which never had a chance to play for us  “We made claims against your club, you asked us to provide examples of my claims, I can’t do that” - you Scottie Pippen couldn’t be bought, that’s the problem. If you truly back yourself, someone will. No club on earth handles disgruntled players well. If they want to leave for more money, they will. Look at an easy example. Cesc Fabregas. Signed a deal with Arsenal until 2014 during the 08 season. When did he leave? 2010, 2011? The world is littered with examples like that. Hell Bale signed a new deal with Spurs only to be sold a year later. And on and on and on and on. Why? Because if clubs don’t let these players go, no one will be stupid enough to sign for them again. Nor do they want a locker room that’s dysfunctional. Nor can Chelsea afford to keep all these players forever. I beg you tp point out when i mentioned trophies. Player power is immense. They have longer contracts then the manger. Sorry for forgetting the overwhelming majority of the 35 players you signed, 10 over the registration cap for the Premier League. I can't name them because I'm not a fan of your joke of a club. I bet you don't know all 35 players signed under Boehly by memory. That's the point, you've made so many joke youngster signings I can barely keep up with the £100million blunders like Mudryk, Caicedo and Enzo.    I'd love to name the players but there's too many that have amounted to diddly squat that their names are irrelevant. It's tough keeping up with those actually getting gametime to think about those nowhere near playing. What is the difference between downing tools on a 5 year contract vs 7 yesrs Easiest way to tell someone doesn’t know what they’re talking about and just parrots media narratives: thinking Mudryk cost £100m and thinking Caicedo didn’t have a good season last year"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Eghbali's ability to dodge the attention and press is impressive Someone else said this on the United sub, but Chelsea have signed 35 players since Boehly and Egbahli took over.   - If you go back 35 signings at United, that’s Romelu Lukaku. - At Liverpool it’s Joel Matip.  - At Arsenal it’s Lucas Torreira.  Edit. Apparently those 35 signings are only permanent signings. I was counting loans for the other clubs. If you include Chelsea’s loans (Felix and Zakaria) that makes it 37 players and that’s;  - Lindelof for United - Gomez for Liverpool  - Leno for Arsenal  Either way, it’s a long fucking time ago. Chelsea have soon spent as much money as us and spurs combined, that's wild He has spent about half of what Ratcliffe paid for 25% of United. Mental. I know this i far from the point of the infographic (and this is a tiresome old man point) but as someone who grew up in the 90s it's still mad to me that Bournemouth have spent half a billion pounds on transfers. Holy shit, to see it like that is crazy. Some moronic Chelsea fan said that Chelsea haven’t done anything other clubs haven’t.  How about spend the most on transfers in English footballing history by £1 billion As a Chelsea fan, this is absolutely fucking disgraceful.  Also, Eghbali flying under the radar again even though by all accounts it’s him sticking his nose into everything and not Todd What is their plan to get a return on investment? They have to change their strategy right? I think everything that Eghbali and Boehly have done since the takeover has been extremely naïve. Like shoveling money into a pit. Spending so much and the ceiling of the current squad being top 4 at best is crazy IT'S NOT FUCKING TODD, IT'S THAT BASTARD EGHBALI You guys don't get it, when they sell Mudryk to Real Madrid for a billion Pounds in a few years it's basically 2 free squads 😁 It’s wild that spurs have spent just about as much as Liverpool snd more than Arsenal and have absolutely nothing to show for it Outrageous. Deduct Everton 10 points. Dont forget inflation. We signed rooney for 600 million and keane for 1 billion so who knows what our real money spent is I am incredibly surprised Brighton is so high even removing boehly's buys under chelsea's total they still come 3rd in most money spent Spurs having the 5th most is actually more surprising to me especially with their underdog act Considering City were poor and shit till 2008, makes you wonder just how they are second to only chelsea. How does Chelsea escape FFP regulations? I need to know if anyone could explain like I’m 5 Map this against combined seasons points table We're 6th because Wenger went 10 years with a positive net spend Also puts into perspective how mismanaged Everton have been... so sad. They should at this point and with their size/fanbase, be battling for European spots. Hold on, hold on.... I thought Liverpool were a small little club that spent no money? And we're built on a shoe string budget? Insane if thiS doesn't pay off for boely. fly serious smoggy towering seed sophisticated selective apparatus hateful elderly   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* “Nothing can stop him!” - FFP Without adjusting for inflation, this doesn't tell us much beyond which clubs have been spending a lot *recently*.  Roughly a full quarter of our total nominal (i.e. not adjusted for inflation) all-time spend (per the chart) has been in the last couple of seasons.  Without breaking spend down by half-decade or something like that, it's very difficult to simply stack up spending figures and say ""look, X has spent more than / as much as / less than Y over their history."" this is going to be so skewed to the modern era i'm not really sure how much it says tbh.   Like they've obviously spent a lot in only 2 years, but I bet if you took any ""elite"" club and looked at the last, say, 5 years they'd be well up this list as well.  its only very recently that the money has completely exploded Weird how city had empty seats at the FA cup final yet have that much money to spend . Eggball's and Boehly's geniuses at display This guy heard it was football and is trying to get 53 players for the squad. What would the net spend picture be like? We are massive I think he thinks having loads of players means he can have more than 11 on the pitch. I wonder if there's a way to get the value adjusted for inflation. Spending 1 billion now as opposed to hitting the billion mark a decade ago will show that the older team has actually spent more. That bottom 5 is also outrageous if you consider how much time they've actually spent in the PL; or in Leeds' case, away from the PL. My real question is why they keep signing so many players. Isn’t half their squad already not registered? Anyone talk about net spend yet? what s the time frame for this ? Bowly and Eggball, Chelsea legends The absolute bizarre part is they haven't got a team, it's just players, who are not even that good, I'd probably say Palmer gets in most teams and Gusto.  You can say James, Enzo, Caicedo etc but you can argue reasons against them.  It's like someone stupid wins the lottery and instantly splashes it all.  From a non fan (barely rivals at this point) it's just very entertaining to see it all, will be even better when football is played, well get weekly memes, let's be real that shit show ain't going to work the way Chelsea believe it will.  Keep going? This is an absolutely wild stat lol.  Chelsea are not getting that much hate (it's more like making fun of rather than hate now) from other team fans because this has been a total failure till now. Things would have been very different if they were fighting for the title with city. City and Chelsea at top is everything wrong with current football Now lets see the revenue generated from player sales Can some explain to me like I’m 5 year old the plan behind Chelsea’s recent spending spree please? Chelsea and Man City should be out of the league That is truly insane and just underlines the level of spending Chelsea have done in the last two years. It’s mad to think forest were the first club to spend 1 million yet were only 19th Boehly whaling irl, gonna pull that maxed out 5 star character any minute now... Soon FIFA needs to fly in Messi as a pity mechanic 😂 They must be dominating Europe. He’s gonna destroy that club Pfffft. Barely top 10. They'll never catch Roman at this rate . . . Boehly will not be pleased with that 10th place finish. Bruh, how the fuck are we 13th?  I know we're a super old club but we never broke 1m transfer until like what? The mid 90's? Then spent most of our time in Championship since then. Can't wait for Chelsea FC to play Chelsea-Under-Todd-Boehly FC  Is this the complete history of English football, or history that started in 1992? 7th spot is up for grabs I'd say Is this the entire history of English football or just the premier league era? Gutted that Arsenal aren't 4th, still top 6 tho so... What makes this worse is everyone around them in England and Europe have all built New mega stadiums or are planning to. Meanwhile, Chelsea are stuck in a championship capacity stadium. All these money should be going into solving the stadium problem. ""Hey we're first on the table"" Didn't Abramovich leave the club debt? >in the history of English football  Being being since 1992 Todd boatly has done wonderful job if you ask me Surely all done perfectly in line with FFP, no suspicious activity right ;-) why is a post about english football using euros? this is hilarious lol Mental. Be interested to see it after sales too. List of transfer fees? Gotta be the top post of the day on r/soccer. Come on Chelsea, buy Joao so you can catch up Wst Ham! Return on investment, you'll never sing that Whoever is in charge over there has to be high on meth, thinking he's playing interactive football manager of some sorts. I can't imagine the headache when he wakes up from the high. When I pointed this out in a city thread I got permanently banned, and they made sure I was also banned from the Liverpool thread Tottenham over Arsenal is embarassing I'd like to see a breakdown by position as well. Chelsea has blown so much money on strikers over the years. Are saints really that high up? On who…? The gap between 3 - 7 is larger than the gap between 7 - 20 I think this American Chelsea guy just loves football. So Chelsea should have a pretty great squad, eh? Would be curious to see this adjusted for inflation and compared to price at the time. As in are there clubs who spent a lot when all players were cheaper but they still overspent I believe Boehly is just laundering American money at this point Ffp when they see this:  oH mY gOd nO wAYYyyGgYy Lol Spurs spending all that to win fuck all todd masterclass Always nice to see old tinpot Bournemouth on a chart. Up the Cherries 🍒 Sad part is we've not even made top 4 once under his regime . And that's why Chelsea win everything. Wait... Honestly I'm just impressed by crystal palace's frugality Oh boy Mid table again ClearlyAJokeLake Capital Maybe we can find some ridiculously expensive former eredivisie players for United. That first spot is well within reach 10th place sounds about spot on for Chelsea under Bohly Guys, does money still guarantee you success? Expected table really pretty much the clubs that have been in the PL most the past 2 decades Seriously, what a deplorable football club it is. It's a joke. Ok so someone explain to me like I'm 5, how is this legal? Man City under pep: 1.29Bn Spurs having a net spend 20 million lower than ours compared to both clubs histories is hilarious City outspending United over the course of the epl is crazy. Chelsea spending the most doesn't surprise anyone in the least Impressive, very nice. Now let's see Pep's transfer fees Boehly is one of the worst things to happen to the English game in recent years, I’d include shitty’s football group aswell Meaningless, add the yearly salary as well for these transfers. So they've spent 5 billion and they're still shit? Would love a before and after Fergie version Are values adjusted for inflation? Wait, how is Spurs above Arsenal ? To be fair, he inherited a very old squad no vision club I think this data would be far better if it was divided by decade to give you a relative idea of spending.  There are teams that would have spent ridiculously in decades gone by but none of that will show up here as significant. No way Chelsea are still 10th on the transfer fee table A good reminder that Transfermarket  isn't a good/reliable source when it comes to transfer fees and so on. The best one can do is to calculate the fees from sources either provided by the club or first tier sources. Transfermarkt being lazy af by not double checking as to who's actually running Chelsea's transfer dealings  currently lol Weird way to cut the data. The daily bash Chelsea FC post. Not great for spurs either having won fuck all in 15 years People need to stop with this ""Boehly’s Chelsea"" stuff. He doesn’t have any involvement in the transfers and football side anymore and hasn’t since the end of 2022.   The man you should be laughing and criticising is Behdad Egbhali. He deserves all the shit that Boehly and more. Arsenal and Spurs combining 4 billion to win 3 FA cups (by Arsenal) is just hilarious You guys are so obsessed with us!  It’s so cute! The man moves in the shadows, preying on unsuspecting Brazilian teens Especially as Clearlake are the majority stakeholders. To those paying attention it’s been pretty clear that this was an intentional strategy - position Boehly as the public face of the club so that he’s the one who is subject to all the media attention.   Outside of the first window it’s questionable how much influence Boehly has had at all. He’s just a figurehead for the ownership really, and it’s worked perfectly. I’m constantly seeing memes about Boehly’s Blues or whatever and there’s very little mention of Eghbali or Jose Feliciano who are the real culprits in charge of our club Seriously, by pretty much all itk accounts, Boehly hasn't been involved since we got sporting directors pretty much at all (not like he could do much with his minority share to Clearlakes 50%) and he even wanted to keep several of the managers that have been fired  This shit show is 100% Eghbali and Clearlake Mostly since Chelsea is not getting any rewards to all these buys. They have become worse off than before. So people don't care. English media are obsessed with throwing Boehly’s name out there, which is exactly what the ownership group intended. I am the Eghbal, I am the Walrus, koo koo kachoo the fact that i have I never heard of this guy till now confirms that fact for me. Isn’t Boehly the face/spokesman of Clearlake? It’s expected that he’d be the lightening rod for criticism Damn, i thought you misspelled Boehly. Schweinsteiger signed in 2015.  Matip signed in 2016  Torreira signed in 2018.  Laporte signed in 2018  Boehly took over in 2022. Llorente for us Idk if you care, but for us it was Aitor Ocio... In 2007 lmao Think someone made that for real Madrid too and 35 signings ago was Toni Kroos back in 2014 Everton’s is lucas Digne, Liverpool’s is Joe Gomez  Me and my mates talked about it yesterday  Batshit mental For spurs it’s Fernando llorente in 2017 I believe Fitting for Wolves, that would take us back to Pedro Neto Schweinsteiger is think, not Lukaku. So even 2 more years. We’re only counting permanent signings, chelsea have signed more (maybe just Felix?) loans too. That's 35 permanent signings. 35 permanent signings for us is Gomez or Firmino Would love to know how much they spent on those 35 players each as well. I think it’s Leno. It’s a difference of nine days though so doesn’t make much of a difference. reminds me of the season fiorentina signed essentially a brand new squad. Think they kept 5 players. Fernando Llorente in 2017 for us Chelsea will be on 50 signings by the start of next season. I don't even remember Gomez at another club Palace is Guaita in 2018 if my counting is correct.  Are you sure your numbers are correct? For some reason it feels that it should be higher. For us I think its Joe Gomez. What about exits though? cause alot of players also left chelsea much more than other teams. There was a point they cleansed all their loaned army Imagine if they had spent it somewhat sensibly and kept Tuchel or Poch. They'd be right up there with City and yourselves. Not much longer until the money spent on players will equal the amount spent to purchase the club. Wouldn’t be far off your respective totals the last 2 and half years alone Typical west londoners No it isn’t… have you seen our owners? [deleted] [deleted] He has less to show for it too. Ratcliffe has at least made some cool stadium revamps. Was their first season in the prem not 2015? Absolutely crazy Spent one more season in the prem than Brighton (just sayin) Seeing us up there is shocking too given we had 5 years under Gao with zero outside cash (banned by the PRC from spending a single pound). So much of that is cash in one hand and out the other. They were man city before the man city era. There was just less noise because there was no ffp. Or just spending over a billion in less than 4 windows. Or spending over 600m in a single season. Or spending over 300m in a single January. Their spending is actually obscene. We got stick a couple years back for reaching £1 billion since Ferguson left (rightly so, it was all wasted). They managed that in 15 months. There was a post about the Neto signing and they were angry at the article because “they used euros instead of pounds to make it appeared as if Chelsea spends more money than they do”. As if its needed when they singlehandedly have spend nearly 1,5 billion in 3 years or so. Can this chart be adjusted for inflation? (just to take into account how much do similar players cost these days) Cheer up. It's time to get excited for Alfie Gilchrist now. Only for him to be sold next summer to fund a 16 year old winger from Brazil. If I recall they had to commit to something like £1.7B over 10 years when they bought Chelsea. Almost there… As a Chelsea fan, I'd be so mad. As an outsider it's kind of funny to watch this going on (and hoping it fails) but imagine someone just buys your club and uses it as a way to flip young players. Also what happens if it all eventually fails? If Chelsea don't improve and Boehly doesn't get the sales he expected and Chelsea is stuck with a huge debt? I think their plan is investing heavily in young talents, hoping they all keep developing and turn into Vinicius Jr-level talents. Then being able to have a world class squad + plenty of talents to sell.  I expect they also think the market prices will keep going up, meaning hoarding early will have to pay off.   All in all it's a huge gamble for a lot of reasons.  - There is no proving these talents will actually become as good as they expect. Especially if you can't promise all of them playtime.  - Keeping everyone happy seems almost impossible, talented players don't want to sit on the bench.  - Transfer bans/FFP. Though Clearlake/Boehly seem to have a decent grasp on loopholes and the system I can't see this working out. A chance that this actually something they expect, and have been preparing for - hence the excessive buying?  - It will be **a few years at least** before these young kids actually reach some kind of potential. Meaning you're likely to be underwhelming for a few more years, which will (rightfully) build more pressure and critisism. I thought their strategy was to tie up young talents on long term contracts to keep their wages low and if they’re successful , sell them off for huge sums. Cole Palmer just got an extension after signing last season a 6-7 yr contract. Increased wages and new contract is for 9 years.   This whole strategy is a piss take because these wages become a mill stone when their players underperform and lose value. I think the idea is that you buy promising young players, lock them into long contracts on decent wages and then turn big profit.  The issue is that they seem shit at figuring out which players will end up being great. I think they looked at Brighton and decided that was the model to make money from football, but have just done it in the most clumsy and scattergun manner The final stage in the commodification of football. Young players bought en masse, in the sole hope of being sold on for 2x/3x/4x in the future. What happens on the pitch is wholly unimportant.  Basically American ultracapitalism putting the final nail in football’s coffin. The expenditures are not a net negative as they have sold a large amount of players. There is definitely a lot of loss but no where near the billions it's obvious money laundering The plan seems to be to try making a profit by flipping players. The majority of the 35 players bought so far will likely never play for the team. Diego Moreira is a good example of such a no-name player who was bought, loaned to Lyon for a fee, and then offloaded a year later.  Of course, they are banking on their hits making up for their misses, which seems ridiculously risky. Never mind the fact that spending ludicrous sums on teenagers puts the club under needless risk of breaching FFP rules without even improving it.  But yeah, they seemingly bought the club to flip players and use it as a store display for their top talents. At the same time, they already started stripping it for assets, like that dual hotel sale that happened in April I think; they sold two hotels that were absolutely printing money to another one of their companies, which they can apparently do despite having a moratorium on selling Chelsea itself for 8 more years.  If they just keep Chelsea midtable, the way TV money's been pouring into the league suggests they'll be able to make their acquisition money back and then some 8 years from now. They'll do their nickel-and-dime act in the meantime and reassess the situation in 2022, I guess. No way that's actually how naive is spelled in English They also happen to be the club with the highest profit margin when selling players. Nobody really likes to talk about that though It's a strategy that's employed by many teams (including Chelsea in the past).  The ""loan army"" has been around in Europe at top clubs, but the difference is that clubs don't pay transfer fees for their young talent.  Or at least not 8-digit transfer fees. It keeps the risk lower, specially as a player with that kind of fee needs playing time to increase their value. Preferably playing time in the EL or CL and the pool of clubs they may loan/sell to gets smaller. I think their main focus is the Copa Libertadores. I don’t even think their ceiling is top 4. I think 5 or 6 is max for them. Aside from Palmer I don’t think their squad has enough goals in them. City, Arsenal, Spurs, Liverpool, United, Villa, and Newcastle all look better sides. Maybe Villa will dip with the CL. Maybe an injury crisis or two for one or two of those teams drops them but I just don’t see Chelsea higher than 5th even with luck  Funnier taking the piss out of a yank tho.    Todd knows you don’t need eleven players for offence AND defence right? It's mental that they've failed to gain any domestic cup or a Conference/Europa. They're never going to be genuine title challengers but the quality of squad/club is absolutely there to be getting the odd cup every now and again but it feels like they always fuck it. I don't really want to defend it, because it is shambolic from us, but club size matters a lot imo.  Liverpool and Arsenal can get better deals with their money because they are much bigger clubs, and can attract players who simply wont come to spurs.  For example, we wanted Mane at the same time as you, he chose you and our backup was Sissoko for more money... Spurs were starting from a much lower point than either Liverpool or Arsenal. If you forget about the 26 trophies they've won, you're right. They have absolutely nothing to show for it. This is also wrong by the way. We are below Arsenal and by a decent margin. Still, we are close enough that it is definitely a failure. And when you consider that we had Bale, Modric, Kane and Son join basically for nothing combined we should have been much higher. Levy is shit at selling players. And we have made some real shit decisions lately.  The good news is that we generate more income than almost anyone because we are run like a business. The bad news is that we’re run like a business. It’s wild that people still think that transfer fees are the only thing that clubs pay when they sign a player Keep the same energy when people claim Haaland cost 500m :) Yeah but none of the figures are adjusted for inflation so it kind of works out? Feels like they've spent most of that this window I mean they had Abramovich right before him so that's not particularly surprising. That's not that crazy though, they have only been under Boehly for like 2 years or something. Our academy being considerably worse than other big clubs in the past plays a decent part I'd imagine Amazing what narratives the media push None of the English top 6 are underdogs, yet we all have to watch them try to portray themselves as such. This is wrong. The actual figures put us below Arsenal in spending. Not by a crazy amount, but still we can run on “point per season” forever to show that we are half decent. We need to win things. In 2008, the most expensive transfer ever was Zidane for £46m. Different times. They were one of the highest spenders in the 90s as well but people assume they weren’t because they got sucked down to league one in 98 City spent more money than 18 of the other 19 teams in 2007. [deleted] It’s not including sales, only buys They also sold ""property"" back to themselves which is another loophole There are 10 teams above us in this list, and for about 20 years we were challenging for Europe. In the time we've been not challenging for Europe we're at a net positive spend, and we've been outspent both net and overall by like 18 teams, including several thay were in the championship for some of that. We only have Pickford in our starting XI that cost any money from the time we were spending and he's our best player. Our team that's been scrapping for survival cost absolutely fuck all Theyre one of the most marketable and profitable clubs in world football, anyone saying that is dumb as rocks Even if they win the league, I have no idea how this ends well for them. It will. [It's still more than twice as much as everyone else tbf](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/premier-league/einnahmenausgaben/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/0?ids=a&sa=&saison_id=2022&saison_id_bis=2024&nat=&pos=&altersklasse=&w_s=&leihe=&intern=0) Yeah, the fact that is almost a league table from last year shows how this is skewed by the recent market prices. Would be a huge effort if you didn't do just the Prem era, but you could do the maths and adjust each year's numbers for inflation. Can't imagine it would make the placings much different though. History of English football so from the start I suppose. But everything done in the 80s or earlier is pretty much a drop in the ocean anyway All time >Chelsea are not getting that much hate  Huh? Where have you been? This sub creams itself with several posts per day about Chelsea.    They are obsessed with us ""city at the top"" narrative with united being £0.16B away. The hate is unreal lol Because the owner thinks this is FIFA. Why? City should be out because they spent £0.16B more than united lol Wouldn't really move the needle much, the record PL transfer until 1984 was £1.5m (equivalent to around £4.8m in 2024)  Even by time the PL was formed the record transfer was todays equivalent of £10m for Gascoigne to Lazio Even if it was just PL era, it wouldn't make a difference.  Bournemouth's spend in this table is likely more than every transfer in English football pre-92 combined It is, just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's not compliant Yet everyone here was cheering for it, you can thank Boris johnson for wanting a quick PR win No the 3.87B includes the stuff under Clearlake Look at the bottom left corner So he bought 4 new squads? Would it have been better if they said ""Since Todd Boehly bought Chelsea""? Because that's clearly what they're getting at here, not who's scouting the players or negotiating the deals. Because them spending so much and still being mid is funny Except they're the only team to break into the top group on any kind of regular basis without being backed by a country in modern football, whilst also building a state of the art stadium. If i want a good laugh i just look at the current chelsea team Forgot about arsenals league titles but continue Real Gs move in silence like lasagna PHRASING And Perez unfairly gets shit for targeting Brazilian teenagers smh Shanghai Todd. Ayrton Senna approves! Boehly did it to himself by being the front of the operation in the media during and after the takeover. He also came out with some incredibly stupid things to the press which didn't help at all like the all star game.  He came out talking way too much being hugely arrogant acting like he knew how to fix the whole sport with his big brain ideas. Completely made a rod for his own back Is the money spending some kind of scam? Tax dodge? Money laundering?  I really don't understand Chelsea spending > keep several of the managers that have been fired  Something about this sentence just made me lose it. Hes only been there 2 years ffs Even the financial press have been covering deals involving his other firms leading with his name, he's absolutely going to generate clicks at this point regardless of the topic due to his reputation  While Toddfather himself isn't that much involved in daily ops, he is still the chair. The current Chelsea story is one of “wealth doesn’t buy success”, which is one that is convincing to people that ignore reality. Position a mouthy American that doesn’t do anything as the one doing the wanton spending, and it’s easy to see why no one is interested in being truthful about who is really running the show over there. Because he fired Tuchel and he didn't even know how champions league qualifiers worked. He was involved at the beginning but due to incompetence he became the face of the media. This only shows Abramovich was a way better owner than him, I hope he buys the club back once this Russia things end so Chelsea can get back to winning titles. Nah he's it a part of Clearlake. He's a minority shareholder. He is the chairman though. Talk about putting things in perspective. You can't even do what Chelsea are doing in video games. If you only include City first team signings, ie not count people who were signed by other CFG clubs and credited to City, then I think the 35th is Wilfried Bony in 2015/16. Is it schweinsteiger or lukaku? Those are large gaps in time WOW Schweinsteiger. That's a name I haven't heard in a while. Didn't even remmeber he played for ManUtd lmao WOW Schweinsteiger. That's a name I haven't heard in a while. Didn't even remmeber he played for ManUtd lmao And that's including an entire summer where we signed literally no one It’s actually Ndombele, I counted myself Im actually surprised it’s only 2007 with Athletic. uff thanks for this cause while I follow the prem, I don’t have the same perspective for those timelines as I would with la liga clubs I was including loans, but maybe without it’s Joe Gomez. The fact we're fuckin' Everpresent FC and we've spent less in our history than Chelsea in 2 years is mindboggling. I also imagine it's surprising for people who forgot how poor we were until like 2016 that we're below Newcastle, Villa and West Ham despite them all being relegated Gomez is our longest serving player as well, that's mental Just looked at ours. Assuming we're not counting loans, it's Harry Maguire from Hull in 2017 lmao They’ve only had two loans in that period, Felix and Zakaria who make it 37. That would be Lindelof for us, but if you only use the permanent transfers then yeah it’s Schweinsteiger. I am amazed the jettisoned Poch after the second half of last season, although a lot of Chelsea fans don't agree. Tuchel I am not so sure about: the decline was already there but who knows. Poch was a disaster. Was absolutely no reason to keep him, if we didn’t get lucky signing Cole on deadline day we probably don’t even finish top half. Your comprehension is off    If you look closely you can see an asterisk after Chelsea's name and then in the bottom left corner it says that Clearlake's spending is included in the 3.87b Have another look at the asterisk on the 3.87B mate. We still have more than you on our own lol Chelsea: 6  Spurs: 2  Arsenal: 13  Id check your math there mate What titles are you talking about here 😂 Arsenal have won 49 trophies to Chelsea’s 36 I would prefer to win without cheating or exploiting loopholes And has bought some exciting players. And made a large revamp of the staff that has allowed the buying of said players  Now if only he figures out a way to stop the constant injuries, so we don't end up playing Evans-Casemiro at CB again. Yeah but this refers to all of English football, not just the Prem. They also got promoted by cheating tbf What’s ffp? That thing that deducts points from Everton and Forrest? And most importantly, the internet was not the same. Noise is manageable without internet. [deleted] And then they kept being Man City during the Man City era. They just haven't got as much out of it They where even worse than City. There was loads of noise about it at the time. There was definitely not less noise, there was more noise. When City started their shit people had adapted to it already. There was plenty of noise it's just new fans take them as more of a ""legacy good team"" because it was long ago enough now, but back in the day people had the same hatred for Chelsea that most have for City now-- and they've been shit for a relatively decent amount of time so its more funny than seen as ""game ruinous"" (inb4 someone points out Arsenal spending a lot in the 30s) Man City before Man City, and Man City after Man City.   Crashed the fucking transfer market on more than one occasion. The clubs a cancer on football. Meanwhile spurs irrelevant before and spurs irrelevant after That's 170m per season(if I'm doing the math right). There's no need for this Just being a part of Chelsea used to have more value. When you're constantly top 4 and competing in the CL then players not being good enough for Chelsea isn't a big sleight after all only the best in the world are starting at top clubs. When you're spending the whole season mid-table for two years not being good enough for a mid-table team doesn't have the same value. There's so much money to be made from flipping young talents (I should know, my club is a prime example of doing just this), but the approach to it from Chelsea has been so painfully naïve. I feel like anyone with experience in club football could have explained to them why their approach was way too risky.  * Players develop into Vini jr on the pitch, not with the practice squad. Players need to be given minutes. Players need to be given patience. Players need to be given proper backing. Players need to grow their confidence and be given a chance to try things. Players aren't like some cookies that you can just slide into the oven and sell when the timer dings. If the players aren't consistently playing, the oven might as well not even be on. * Chelsea as a club is too high profile to be a youth development and selling club. They are not Benfica, Porto, Ajax, Brighton, or Borussia Dortmund. The starting 11 needs to perform immediately, every season, and it's been that way since Mourinho and Abramovich. And in my opinion that's how it should be for Chelsea. You smartly work youth and academy graduates into the team, but it should primarily be made up of experienced players in their primes who want silverware. There's no time to teach kindergarten. The team's job is to win titles now. It's how they grew to be so high profile in the first place. The recent recruitment strategy has replaced nearly every experienced player and much of the identity of the team has been lost. For me, the identity of Chelsea and the club's success was built off players like John Terry and Frank Lampard. I see no players like them in today's Chelsea. And in the past, they already made fine business just by flipping fringe players, academy graduates, and players from their loan-army. I think if nothing had changed at all they'd both make more money from transfers and perform better in the league. * If the squad is 40+ players deep, it's so much more difficult for the manager to work with the individuals and instill their ideas compared to a small squad with a clear structure and hierarchy in each position. It's harder to keep a healthy environment and squad unity, rather that a team made up of multiple friend groups. It's harder to organize training sessions and scrimmages. It was a problem that Potter was vocal about.  * You also can't expect the players to grow into a system or style of play if the managerial position is a revolving door.  * You can't expect to sell all these players for profit if you get them for crazy (albeit amortized) fees and premier league wages. Currently it looks like Palmer, Lavia, and Madueke are the only ones that could potentially give Chelsea a good profit if they sell them on. Also the potential buyers are essentially limited to Premier League rivals in the top 6, the Spanish giants, the Italian giants, Bayern, PSG, and Saudi. The growth of the market is not infinite. The only reason the market is what it is today is because of Neymar to PSG. It will still grow, but it's dependent on the wealth of the wealthiest league, the PL, and how much oil giants will accept overpaying for players. * Sacrificing a couple years to mediocrity hurts the brand, the players, the fans, international appeal, and the general reputation of the club. You can stomach it if the results turn around and the patience is paid off, but despite promises, management is not patient, the team does not look much better than what it was 2-3 years ago, and the competition for top spots isn't any easier, all while there's a billion in the hole. And a struggling team isn't afforded better deals on player sales. * And ultimately, if it all doesn't work out, you're stuck with a humongous mess. Imo Chelsea should be extremely grateful to Poch for managing things last season and happy things aren't worse.  If you asked me, it's pretty much the opposite of how I'd run a club. Even if with the infinite money glitch, Chelsea's recruitment strategy has been so reckless and wasteful, in terms of wasting money, time, and talent. Sorry Chelsea fans if this is harsh, but yeah, I think the post-Abramovich ownership really failed the club and the fans. A lot could have been avoided with some common sense, and top 4 would probably be secure. Looking at Everton and Forest, it seems that FFP breaches will lead to points deductions instead of transfer bans. Though given that they appear intent on turning Chelsea into more of a football hedge fund than club that might not be too big a blow for the owners. Values will already take a hit by virtue of not having room for everyone. Mudryk has tanked and then you have all those guys like Santos and Washington who haven't been heard from already. Clearly everything in moderation is not to be found at Chelsea. Not to mention the yearly amortization for so many players seems like it would defeat the purpose of whatever they are doing. The other issue is that the young players can't properly develop if they aren't able to regularly play since the squad is so big. Having a strategy where WINNING FOOTBALL MATCHES is the priority would probably be a better place to start. Running the club like some hedgefund (invest in ""promising assets"", find financial loopholes, etc.) doesn't seem to be the best approach. Maybe someone should tell them. The thing is that their best chance of this paying off is if they have multiple £100m+ players to sell. And there only maybe 5 teams willing to spend that sort of money on players and even fewer if they don’t want to sell to a direct competitor. So there’re basically counting on Real and PSG buying their players. Another possible risk for their plan is that some kind of harder cap on spending will be adopted in the league.  Edit: I don’t think I was clear but I mean some sort of a cap on salaries/transfers that’s the same for all teams, not relative to the team’s own income. Also unlike real world appreciating assets, footballers are on contracts and their market value can dip to 0 if they just refuse to extend their contract with Chelsea, which also seems a likely outcome for many of these youngsters if they come to realise what a shitshow they're stuck in. It’s funny because a lot of people were acting like signing those long contracts and amortizing the transfer fees over 8 years was some genius loophole. The reason no one was signing young players to 8 year contracts is that it was an enormous gamble, not because they lacked the galaxy brains to do it. Their plan is to start a mini league with in the premier league. Football fans need something to watch midweek. They are going to do the team selection big brother style. Holy shit, Palmer's contract is 9 years? Great player, but that is insane 🤯 Another issue is that you simply can’t put a bunch of talented young players together (no matter how talented they are) and expect it to be a well oiled machine fighting for the top spots. Young talented players thrive when they’re integrated in an already established well oiled machine with leaders, not when you drop a new dozen of them on the training pitch every couple of weeks. The conventional wisdom seems to be that that they're trying to buy young players and then flip them for profit down the line, as you said. However, I'm wondering how do players like Fernandez and Caicedo (and to a bit lesser extent some others, such as Mudryk) fit into that plan - they cost eyewatering amounts and ain't no way they'll ever be able to sell them for profit.   But if the idea is to build a strong squad instead and create value through that, then why buy all these random youngsters? Spending £1.3billion to become a selling club is something else Nice one, didn't see that coming 😂 Also firing Poch and getting Maresca will backfire We scored 77 goals last year which is our third highest ever tally, the bigger issue was our defence, I think we conceded the most we've ever done in a 38 game season, and pre-season has done nothing to show that's been improved. >Todd knows you don’t need eleven players for offence AND defence right?  We have 9 goalkeepers. What do you think. I think Eghbali is also American. WIth the piss poor attitude of the fans and to an extent the players and club, where DOmestic Rivalry is bigger than UCL, you can see why I mean, I do think club size plays some factor but another just as important if not more important factor is that you guys don’t want to compete in terms of wage with the other big clubs. At that point, why would the best talents come to you?  I respect the commitment to keeping your wage bill low but this is the drawback of it. Also we built an entire new stadium, went to a CL final, and challenged for the title twice when before we hadn't since the 60-70s. We came from mid table to do this. At what starting point are you talking here though?   In the mid 90s Arsenal finished 10th and 12th. Spurs outspent Arsenal in the late 90s and still had nothing to show for it. They followed that up with outspending them again, for the entire following decade, and in that time they didn’t even finish above Arsenal once, winning just the League Cup too.   Not sure what excuses can be made for that when they haven’t exactly been a tier below in resources. And? They still have nothing to show for it Well they’re still at a lower point than either Liverpool or Arsenal so what was the point of all that spending? That’s great but we are talking about money spent compared to honors, and the vast vast majority of money spent on transfers for all clubs has been in the PL era, with most of it in the last few decades.  Spurs league title in 1950 and 1960 don’t really change things as transfer spending was a drop in the bucket then.    The sum total of their honors in the 21st century is a league cup in 2008.  That’s a failure when you are this high on the spending list.  Sorry. Im memeing Yeah, Chelsea's success is built on piles and piles of money And this is a big factor in Chelsea being so much at the top, as well. One of the top if not the top academy since Abramovich bought the club. You have to sell to buy. Chelsea sells a lot of players for a lot of money What media is pushing us as underdogs lol. It’s a bit relative to other top 6 clubs Keep in mind, the pound was quite a bit stronger than it is now. 46 million in 2001 is closer to 60-65 now, not adjusting for inflation. That transfer is still the most ridiculous as an percentage of revenue. If Madrid did that transfer again right now they'd be paying over 600m. Which goes to show how pointless these things are. great explanation! thank you! No not really regarding only income being from sales. Chelsea are picking up money from all of the loans too, they add up Correct. They buy someone and pay across the length of the contract (Enzo Fernandez) but the moment they sell Connor Gallagher it’s immediately 40m added in revenue. Interesting to see Spurs at second. Had no clue they’d spent half a billion in the last few seasons. We just stuck out like a sore thumb, plenty have teams have spent loads we’re just on our own planet 19th with a significant positive net spend is certainly something. Less than a third of West Ham with a difference of €350m in our net spends, *far* below Forest (€330m difference), Villa, Wolves, Bournemouth and Southampton, and a fair bit below Leeds, Burnley, Fulham and Brentford even before taking net spend into account. Even if you go back 5 years we're still net positive by a big chunk, and *well* below Southampton, Leeds, Forest, Wolves and not even in the same league as the likes of Villa, West Ham and Newcastle for both overall and net spend.   The reason we're fucked is because 6 or 7 years ago we put ourselves on a borderline impossible to correct collision course with catastrophe with Pickford and Michael Keane the only players bought for any money still to show for it, but you still get people saying we continued to overspend like crazy but still end up in relegation battles. Our current squad was bought for fuck all which is why we've been shhhhhite How are they all ''losing''  money. Can anyone business-savvy eli5 ? hadn't clocked that its just the 22-23 premier league minus brentford at all, nice spot.  would be a dead interesting exercise to do this adjusted for relative spending power, so like, us spending 18m on Rio Ferdinand is probably a 50-60m transfer now, etc. You'd get to see who the actual big spenders were historically rather than just who has been in the top flight recently That's really well spotted. Definitely crazy how fast the market has been blowing up over the last few years. Expect it will just keep going up too. have the transfer prices been adjusted ? We are quite high (as expected) but the delta looks quite huge. Compared to city, Chelsea get significantly less hate currently imo. Do you think the argument would be the same if Chelsea won a PL during this time. Is that more of ridiculing or hate (like city). Remember that City had a lot of catching up to do - their pre-takeover transfer record was 15mil (euros) for Anelka in 02. United already had 12 transfers (Ferdinand, Veron, Rooney, Anderson, Van Nistelrooy, Carrick, Nani, Hargreaves, Yorke, Ronaldo, Saha and Stam) for more than that amount. United have spent silly money on silly players the last decade for sure, but their spending in that time still isn’t close to what city have spent (hence the 115 charges) united is a big club whos earned it tho just proving you are not more than 14 year old? Utd are basically the face of PL, City only became relevant in 1/3 of its tenure and still overtook utd on spending where in reality they should not even have crossed the halfway mark. There is a reason why there are 115 charges which can relegate Man City Tell us you’re a football illiterate without telling us you’re a football illiterate. So you've spent as much as we have in our entire existence, in 24 months and you're still shit? 😉 I think my point still stands, just adjust the figure. >Because that's clearly what they're getting at here  It's not clear at all. This is still insinuating that he's involved, which has been largely nonsense for the last year and beyond.   Look at how many journos on pods and outlets still refer to Boehly as the main head figure. Why should they be given the benefit of doubt here? How dare you. They're 10th (under Todd Boehly (actually Eghbali)). [deleted] he said what he said Are we still doing phrasing? Inappropes Well I think Perez started what we see now. The all-star game genuinely is a pretty fun idea- as unlikely as it will ever be to take place.  But as a Chelsea fan, I will happily say I have absolutely no idea what is happening the club right now. No direction, no consistency, just absolute wild west type of signings. Man gave his opinion and you can criticize him for that but that still has nothing to do with how Chelsea are being run.  Man is simply an employee and the mouthpiece of the ownership group.  It’s the equivalent of blaming the Press Secretary for what the American government does. Nah the all star idea didn’t receive much criticism. It’d be a good idea too As far as we can tell no, they legitimately think this is the best way to achieve the goal of Clearlake (to make money)   Seems ludicrous to me, the speed and size of their spending just doesn’t seem to add up. No, just mba’s and banker bro’s trying to buy young potential at low costs and make their money off loan fees and the transfer fee if they aren’t good enough. Sometimes you get lucky and find a Cole Palmer.   But this happens to cause a multitude of problems with psr/ffp, the clubs finances and having to move properties to balance the books, selling academy products for “profit” Yeah pretty much everyone except seemingly Eghbali hates that we've gone through Tuchel, Potter, Saltor (interim), Lampard again (interim), Poch, and now onto Maresca in the span of 2 years Exactly… *he* didn’t do anything, definitely not on his own ever. I can do it in FM alright (without the still playing like shit part) It's basically the ideal strategy on FM Found the lucky guy who never played FC24 Wild Matey must have changed his post.  If it's Lukaku then he signed in 2017. I made a mistake with Chelsea’s 35 signings. I thought that included loans but 35 is the permanent signings.   Chelsea made two loans. Including loans, 37 signings back for United is Lindelof.   Only including the 35 permanent signings then it’s Schweinsteiger. I saw Llorente on r/coys Did you count loans? Since they only sign basque players, the pool of potential signings is very shallow so a lot of their first team player end up coming from their youth system.   Sign 'em young and develop them is their way. A Rodgers signing btw Hard to consider loans, Kabak and Arthur weren’t really loaned into the first team. They were loaned into the infirmary. The 3 closest teams above us have seen relegations and multiple seasons in the lower leagues in the last 10-15 years aswell as playing in the lower leagues for periods throughout history   We’re the longest serving top flight team in England and we’re not even top 10 biggest spenders thanks to a nutty American with all pockets no sense Yeah, that’s what I thought. But atm you included only permanent transfers for Chelsea and permanent+loans for Utd, so it’d make more sense to normalize it some way Saul was a loan too actually. Technically Kova too, but we signed him so he doesn't count towards that. I still think Tuchel would've been better than everyone since, but what he really needed was a break.  He had that hell of a season and his divorce at the same time, and then he didn't take a break in the summer.  He looked absolutely frayed by the end.  Telling, I think, that the next place he popped up after they fired him was on an Ayurvedic medicine podcast at a health spa, lol. [deleted] Trust me Poch was really really bad last season. I was actually shocked.   From the outside I thought he did great work at Southampton and Spurs, and I kinda hand waved his time at PSG cause they’re a bit of a mess of a club.   But after having him manage us for a season I was genuinely surprised at how poor he was. So many of the same issues he had later on at at Spurs were still present, and this time he didn’t have a top 3 PL striker to help carry the team.   It’s a shame cause he seems a nice enough bloke, I really hope he takes some time to reassess cause otherwise I fear he might be done at the highest level. Really interested where he goes next. You’re being generous there too. Chelsea are on 34 and City 36. Like to insert yourselves into things More grenadier sales True, but how much of pre-premier league spending is insignificant on this list? Yes. FFP is Financial Fair Play, applied by UEFA to any club in a European competition (UCL, Europa, etc.).  PSR is Profitability and Sustainability Rules, and must be followed by all Premier League clubs. This is what was used to deduct the points from the clubs you mentioned.   But people commonly use ""FFP"" to stand in for either set of rules, since that is the older and better-known term. Nearly everyone hated them back then. They've just been 'saved' by Man City doing it better. They’ve spent 1.32bn in 2 years at a time when the PL transfer record is £105m. This is worse. I would argue they have. 5 premier leagues and 2 champions leagues. they weren't, look at how much manchester city has spend, they probably haven't spend more than 50 mil before 2008. So thats 2.6 billion in 15 years It's also worth bearing in mind *where* City bought players from. They specifically targetted players from their rivals for Champions League qualification to weaken them. Barry and Milner from Villa, Lescott from Everton, and Adebayor, Clichy, Toure and Nasri from Arsenal At least we didn't suck off a warlord in our stadium. But Enzo and Moises Tbf they spent only one season in the mid table and managed to creep back into a ""top 6"" finish last year.   In retrospect it was a pretty incredible job Poch ended up doing to turn around 12th into 6th in a single season *after* they axed all the experience apart from Silva and Sterling, their injuries being insane and the team having all just met. The team seemed like if they left it as it was at the end of last season it was in actually in a great position to grow together.   Owners then reward that progress by changing it all up again immediately lmao. Tbf they spent only one season in the mid table and managed to creep back into a ""top 6"" finish last year.

It looks like only Barca and Atleti are in Spain (although we know Real will for the right person it just doesn’t seem that they have lately), Bayern can spend but typically don’t go excess either. So really it’s Saudi or PL at the core and by selling your top players to other PL sides you cement yourself as a mid table team. Dortmund are the exception not the rule for this with everyone moving on to Bayern  Few things make my eye twitch more than our fans trying to claim that Clearlake is simply too knowledgeable to fail. Every decision is some genius idea that somehow every other owner hasn’t tried Iranian-American a quick Google search says.  Completely unrelated but my brain keeps reading Eghbali as Eggball. We're more likely to win the Europa than UCl though. Arsenal also did this, but just over a decade before you.  They were in a much better league position though I'm talking about the point that 95% of this money is from, the last 15 to 20 years, and the period of not winning Spurs are critcised for which is basically the same timeframe. I don't know what going back 30 years to pick a couple of outlier seasons where Arsenal finished below Spurs due to A) being depleted by 2 successful cup runs and B) their best midfielder being in rehab and their manager being sacked due to a bungs scandal midseason and going into a tailspin proves to serve.   We could go back to the early 60s and say Arsenal started lower because Spurs did a double with Danny Blanchflower and Cliff Jones, but most of that period isn't much effecting either the transfer fees that this post is about, or the last 17 years for which Spurs are being criticised for not winning,. aren't they? Why add genuine context when you can just words. [deleted] To vastly improve their position, whilst building a state of the art stadium? They were perennially 14th, now they're the only club since the Premier League began to regularly mix it with the fortunate elite without state backing. Ok well the fact remains, they're 5th on this list and during the time period this list covers theyve won the 6th most trophies which is very clearly not ""absolutely nothing to show for it"". But believe whatever makes you happy mate 👍 You're not funny. They won 14 trophies pre-Abramovich takeover (98 years)  And 22 trophies post-Abramovich takeover (21 years)  I know he threw shit loads of money at them but also fair play to him that's quite an impressive turn around. So is Manchester United’s and Liverpool’s and Arsenal’s…… Every successful team has success built on piles of money. And I love it. We are putting a new meaning to Hollywood fc. Everyday I log into reddit to find a new episode is out. you are by far the best selling big English club outside of maybe Man City, but do you worry about what might happen if your academy dries up and you have a few years without talents you can flip for profit? This spending is reckless now but at least there are considerable sales that offset a portion. If you dont have any pure profit to sell I fear you might be PSR fucked Mainly the English media Oh no! We only spent 150m this summer, not 200m! We're underdogs.  That's what they all sound like. The prices inflate because of the teams spending money like this. I mean selling hazard in there would make the numbers change pretty good by itself Solanke’s recent purchase is included (valued at 64m), otherwise they’d basically be tied with Arsenal  I think the more interesting part is that Chelsea has 30+ more arrivals than other big 6 teams. Usually top teams only buy players to replace outgoing ones or to specifically strengthen an area, Chelsea seems to be buying wonderkids for the sake of it.  Also lol Liverpool with only 27 arrivals. If FSG weren’t so cheap Klopp would have a few more trophies probably we've wasted a lot of money but 100 million pounds of that is gray and our record signing solanke, neither of whom have played an official for us yet as they just got signed. Bit harsh to say money wasted with nothing to show for it about players who havent touched the pitch yet Goes so under the radar people constantly bring up our spending under Arteta when they have spent basically the same amount It doesn't say anything about adjustments so don't think so Even adjusting by general inflation, player's buying fees skyrocketed between the 80s and 90s.  To give you an idea, John Charles' 1957 transfer from Leeds to Juventus broke the record for a British transfer fee with £65K. According to a £ inflation calculator I found online that would be just £1.3M today, barely enough to buy almost any first tier player today.  Also, back then most players barely transfered at all or only did during the ends of their careers. And many of those transfers were actually free transfers. So even adjusting all those transfers by inflation I don't think we would see any noticeable change. 115 charges, literally cheating. They probably pay pep 30M a week off the books, they've lied since day 1 with their accounting They claim that they hate us or ridicule us but given every other post on this subreddit is about us I’m starting to think they have a crush on us and don’t know how to say it Oh I’m plenty literate.  Answer the question for me then Well if by shit you mean only 5 points off you in one of your best seasons in recent history then yes lool. Jokes aside it’s actually crazy how much we’ve spent to be at the level we are in the last two years If this was about ""Since FSG took over Liverpool"", no one would be confused about what it means. Google it > The all-star game genuinely is a pretty fun idea- as unlikely as it will ever be to take place.  All star games sound better in theory than they actually are. Just look at the NBA/NFL the allstar game/pro bowl mostly are just plain boring to watch. It's just not. I don't want to see Liverpool players playing alongside United or City players under some corporate banner. It devalues the rivalries which have already lost their edge.  It's different for England because it's something we all support. But playing alongside rivals under some soulless all star team, in an era when there is far too many games anyway, is not what I want to see. Especially when it'd inevitably get exported to America or Saudi.  It's just another example of foreign capitalists moving the game away from its local roots I'm not saying he's the day to day guy but he is co-controlling owner and chairman. ""Mouthpiece"" and the likeness to the press secretary is wide off the mark. That's an absolutely ridiculous thing to say, he's not just an employee or a press security. He is the co-controlling owner and chairman. He probably has the greatest shareholding of any one person, and the majority shareholder Clearlake appointed him as the face of their side of the investment and chairman of the club, meaning he leads the board meetings and the administration. Press engagement was just one of his objectives and it's another one he failed miserably at.  So in terms of operational decisions, as a co owner and chairman he actually arguably has more say than Eghbali, who is co owner and a board director therefore gets a vote like any other board member, but as chairman Boehly has precedence. It's clearlakes money that they've trusted Boehly to manage and we don't know the details of that agreement but I'm certain it's contractually stringent.  Yes he is implementing the strategy agreed with Clearlake, but they are clearly equal partners and Boehlys role is to front the decision making and running of the club. His early role was also incredibly involved in the actual day to day stuff like transfers and contracts which he was clearly unqualified for and took on out of pure hubris whilst letting Marina and Cech go.  If he was just an employee they'd have sacked him by now. But the reality is he was the one with a sporting background and so was clearly the instigator and leader for the takeover but sought investment from elsewhere because he doesn't have that kind of wealth. He deserves maximum criticism for every decision made along with Clearlake. Shat an absurd comparison > Man gave   > Man is   The world you're looking for is ""He"" people nowadays gonna criticize you for everything, talking too much, talking too little, can't win So is he like Woodward for United who had actual control but needed approval from Glazers or just the secretary of the CEO of a company. He put that group together, he wanted to buy a club for a long time, he chose to bring them in, he chose to have his face as the leader, when shit hits the fan he can't just say he is doing nothing now. The only reason Eghbali is here and owns us is because of Todd, so ultimately Todd is responsible for everything that is happening and will happen to us. Infact it's actually amazing that Todd can just pass off all the shit blame to Eghbali so easily.  That's a clear strategy of that group, they will try to put all the blame on Eghbali and others now in turbulent times, and will bring Todd back in good ones, but I am glad Public know who made this deal and who was the face. They want Todd's image to be as the good guy, for when he buys another thing, he is the face. For all we know internally Todd is still as much involved ever, but just acting he isn't. The snake thinks he is very clever. And astounding that our fans eat all their shit up and act how good a guy Todd is, when he is in bed with Clearlake all his life, knew these guys too well and yet picked them to buy us. That snake has always been like this, like when he acted he is has a lot to do with Dodgers success when in fact he got no fucking big say in their strategy or rise. Glad that all of this is stuck to him and his good cop bad cop routine isn't working.  Todd isn't the good guy, he is actually the worse one. He's the bad cop. Not English I presume If you do it how the Glazers did their glazernomics at United it becomes more clear (sadly). By adding the transfer fee + costs for wages over the contract to the lists of assets for the club and it inflates the valuation of the club.  Combine that with the amortization done in football - and an expectation that the revenue will always go up (supplemented by player sales) so they can keep doing the same thing over and over, while kicking the can down the road until the decide to sell (and thus put it square in the new owner(s) lap).  This is on top of dividends that they might take out, and the steady increase of value of any PL club as it is currently. Damn, it really sets in when you put the whole list together and the time frame. Bad news is imo Maresca is a fraud and will be gone before Christmas Not that it makes it much better, but Maresca hasn't actually managed a real game for us yet, and it's technically over 3 seasons. Having said that, it's entirely possible that the list will have grown by the end of this 3rd season... He fired Tuchel, stupidest move he did so it's a good thing he moved out of the way and put somebody as incompetent as him. This list when used is revisionism. The only person here that’s a stupid firing is tuchel. Potter deserved to be fired, Poch didn’t agree with the policy of the club, didn’t deserve to be fired its so funny It happens in FM because I get into a new season and suddenly 40 18-year old Brazilians arrive who I signed three years ago then forgot about. Yeah if I drop 1b on a team in FM, you bet your ass you're going to be winning 5 Champions Leagues in a row. I vote for you to replace Maresca once he inevitably gets sacked in Feburary. Basically the entire 8 season, 18 trophy, 4 league titles in a row, treble winning, domestic quadruple winning Guardiola squad cost what Chelsea have spent in 2 years. Ok im getting 3 names now. The person you replied to is now saying its lindelof. No, and I didn’t count youth transfers either like Devine or Paskotsi but then it would’ve been someone even more recent That really does put it into perspective wow, lmao  fuck Chelsea Well I counted Jack Butland for United so I’m afraid you’re going to have to take them. Ben Davies was transferred to the cupboard under the stairs They were both under Abramovich. Tuchel famously didn't want a say in transfers, just wanted to coach. Boehly wanted Tuckel's oppinion on every transfer. Its one of the reasons they fell out. I believe that the falling out had more to do with the sacking than on field performance. Poch may have wanted to keep both Gallagher and Chalobah, which made a mutual parting all but inevitable.  The entire club is suffering at the hands of 2 muppets in the Sporting Director role, and even then the majority shareholder (Clearlake) keeps backing them. Wasn't his choice at all, TT was very happy at the club. I think Poch had a different vision and wanted to retain players like Gallagher and recruit experienced players at odds with Chelsea's buy anyone vaguely promising under 21. I'd be amazed if any manager can sort out that runaway train now. Mate he inherited a shit show that somehow he managed to make functional. You need to stop blaming the latest manager that gets dropped into its steaming pile. I just counted them on Wikipedia and it said 36, might be including a couple weird ones He directly spoke about Arsenal what are you talking about I don't mean pre-Premier League. They might've spent a decent amount in the Championship before getting promoted in 2015.  ETA: When I say a decent amount, I mean they spent a lot It was a joke man, not that serious. Yes, I'm old enough to remember it, but in 2003 Facebook didn't even exist and the iPhone 3GS was 6 years away. That puts things in perspective.  Chelsea was bought in a different era. I still think Chelsea did it better, it was such an instant impact while city had to spend for years to gradually get better and reach the top. Obviously chelsea weren't that far away to start as city.  I think the feelings around it were different too since nobody doubted when City got bought they'd be ultra successful if they spend insane money, people kind of thought it would be harder for Chelsea since there wasn't the precedence [deleted] It all sucks, particularly because Chelsea were the first club to more or less make losing money a normal thing. A plaything for an oligarch. Sure you can argue that it's sour grapes from an Arsenal fan, but I think that globally, football has suffered for it. City have won the league nearly twice as many times while being rich for less time and have a CL of their own.   I'd love to see both clubs disappear forever but of the two projects I think City's has been the step up from theirs. No, because City didn't spend like Chelsea relative to the other teams. 2003 Chelsea spending is the most we have seen in the Premier league relative to the other.  https://tomkinstimes.com/2014/08/how-chelsea-ruined-football/  And they where even starting at a better position than City. They spent more than £50m in 2007 alone lol They were. When Chelsea were first taken over, transfer spending in a summer was nowhere near what it is now. These days the entire top 8 are spending around £130-200mil per summer each so spending £250mil is still a massive window but it's not that far ahead of your competition.   Back then teams in the top 4 were averaging around £15-30mil spent per summer and United were sometimes spending around £30-40mil. The three seasons before Abramovich came in, United had spent £85mil, Arsenal £55mil, Liverpool £55mil, Newcastle £60mil. That's over 3 years though. And that was Champions League level teams as well. The rest of the top 10 were spending less than half that unlike today with West Ham or Villa spending £150mil.  Roman came right in and spend £120mil his first season in 2003. Then another £95mil the next year. It's the equivalent of spending £700mil in a season these days and then spending another £500mil the next year as well. You have to factor in the inflation in transfer fees from the period where Chelsea invested the most money without return 2004-10 and now. Non of those where as big as Torres or Ashley Cole. They also bought from English teams. They also went after Gerard in his prime and could have probably gotten him if it wasn't for the threats. Stones from Everton too If you think roman was a warlord you're delusional, he was a quick PR win for boris after he got caught with his pants down with his covid parties. But whatever keep coping I phrased it as spent most the time at mid-table because as you said they did creep up to 6th but they spent quite a bit of the season around 10th. Not sure where mid-table really starts and ends though. Traditionally I took it as just not big 6 and not relegation fodder but things are changing. Ultimately I don't think it changes the point that the perception of Chelsea has changed so being a bench player struggling to get minutes is held against a player much more than before. The team ended up clawing to 6th but not many players have been rated highly (by us public idiots at least). Remains to be seen if that will have any true lasting impact or if Chelsea course corrects and that all changes. Who knows what happens now they tore it all up again. Did you just say Real don't splash money? Yep. I do battle with these morons everyday in our subreddit. I've aged a lot during the Gallagher saga. and thats why you wont ever win the PL in a decade! Building the new stadium probably affected us more than it did for Spurs as well Which is precisely why I asked “At what starting point are we talking here”, because there’s only so long you can get away with that “starting at a lower point” excuse if you’re continuously spending more than your rivals anyway.   There’s very few reasons why Spurs shouldn’t have been doing better than Arsenal by the end of the 00s, when Arsenal had quite literally no new investment and were financing the stadium, the same reasoning your putting down to Spurs failings now pretty much.   Spurs have underachieved massively, but tend to play this off by acting like they’ve always been closer in resources to the likes of Villa, Newcastle and Everton. Given the difference of 1 trophy between Spurs in 6th, Villa in 7th and Everton in 8th, literally every neutral is picking Villa’s 7 titles + UCL or Everton’s 9 league titles over Spurs’ domestic cup haul. Nah haven't you heard fuck spurs haha meme club haha nO tRoPhIeS lol upvotes. Since 2000 they have spent more than 10m euros on 78 different players and have a single league cup.  If that is the definition of a successful club then I guess we all have our standards. Well the meme is more in reference to this nonsense you tend to hear around our expenditure apposed to me being a standup comedian Well, it pays to be the first one. And he was the first to dump hundred of millions of his own money into a football team. Don't forget the season where Chelsea spent about as much money on transfers as the rest of the league in total It's really not that impressive when he just hoovered up all the top talent in world football. He was also ahead of the pack, the other clubs couldn't really compete with the spending, there was noone to drive up the price. And don't forget that 1 mil could buy you much much more when Arbamovich took over.   It also helps that the team he got when he took over wasn't as far of the top, they had been slowly rising trough the table. Where did you get 14 trophies from? I'm sure you're including non-majors. So what Sheikh Mansour did is also impressive right? And he spent less than Roman inflation adjusted Nah, for most team it's:  Success > Money > More success > More money  For Chelsea it was:  Money > More Money > Success > More Money > More success Nah, most teams aren't pumped full of external money from owners before success like you and Chelsea have been [deleted] Yup. The difference in accounting for buying Caicedo vs selling Hazard is a good example of what’s being talked about here. They’re buying so many players because they want to flip them for a profit later. It’s really strange to see a strategy like this unfold in real time. Liverpool is crazy tho, they’re below the likes of West Ham, Villa, Newcastle and Forest. I know they had a lot of world class players in the squad already before that time period but Klopp really does so much with so little comparatively People do that with Chelsea players too. It’s harsh but there’s still a lot of money being spent there Since Arteta’s first full season they’ve spent 20m more than you and are also second only to us still. Crazy how they get away with accomplishing nothing despite spending huge just because the standards are so low for them. Birmingham and Wigan have won trophies more recently General inflation doesn't exist. Inflation, by definition, is general. It's like saying ""non-gaseous, non-solid, non-plasma liquid water"".  Because of this definition, Inflation cannot be used to adjust for price changes in individual markets and there is no reason whatsoever to expect them to. It's like comparing global pirate numbers to greenhouse gas emissions and expecting a correlation. If it happens, it's a coincidence.  Presumably what you meant by ""general inflation"" is CPI inflation. This is a particular scheme for measuring the general price level; similar to how you could decide the ""most successful team"" based on points all time, points per game, trophies won or whatever other metric. CPI stands for ""consumer price index"" and is generally thought of as capturing the prices that the average household is exposed to. Due to its instrumental uses, the CPI should not be used for measuring the prices that households are exposed to (anything with an interest rate must be excluded from the CPI) and instead a HLPI used instead (household living cost price index).  There are transfer fee adjustment schemes out there. For example, I've seen Tweets from, iirc, the University of Liverpool academics that used such a scheme to do something ages ago. Either their indices aren't publicly available or I did a very bad job of trying to find them. True but 80s and 90s and even 2000s transfers in 2024 money will be quite a different: £15 million for Shearer in 1996 would be the equivalent of £35 mill and Pogba £89million in 2016 would be £121 million in today money. Ronaldo's transfer to United (from Sporting) would be almost like £25 million in today money.   Anyway I wasnt trying to say anything controversial, just that the deltas looked off. Haha finally someone on Reddit that can banter! Hopefully we can both be fighting for CL spot this year.   But yeah, it's baffling how much you've paid for some fairly mediocre players too. How do Chelsea fans feel about Gallagher leaving? I can’t say I’ve ever watched one in all fairness. But I can definitely imagine that certain players would not be totally keen to play alongside other players- not to mention clubs being wary about players getting injured in what would be a glorified friendly contest. *Lots of ppl agree with you I'm sure and I think it wouldn't produce anything ""exciting"" or high quality but ...   I hope you realize that no ""all star game"" has anything to do with fans ... And is entirely about selling the ""product"" for more TV money? For example, once players in the NFL and NBA recognized this ... The quality of the ""game"" has gone to complete shit ... The players still participate because their salaries will drop if the games not hosted (cause there's one less product to sell to the TV suits). It's simple as that truly lol.   There's one all star game that matters and it's the MLBs because they assign home field advantage in the World Series using the all Star games results (if I remember correctly).   *I'm struggling a bit because it seems you're basically assigning a common business practice that granted is foreign to European football should be attributed to ""Todd Bohely"" (a business man who was asked about how he'd run a business) ... It's a bit silly and senseless to take it any other way ...  but I get (and agree) that it's probably a shocking thing culturally to wrap your head around.* What if your choice is between [insert derby here] in New York, Abu Dhabi, Beijing or wherever and an ""All Star Game"", which is pretty much always played overseas? >is wide off the mark.  like Chelsea strikers Id agree mouthpiece is miles wide of the mark, think he owns about 10% give or take, unfortunately for him hes the 1 thats taking the bullets right now untill another takes the public spot. You do realise co-owners and chairmen don’t have complete authority over the club?  Same way the President can’t sign a bill into law without congress.  The people with the real power in all this mess is the people with a controlling interest.  And last time I checked it was Clearlake co-founded by Boehly…oh no that’s right it’s Eghbali. Have to goldilocks it and talk just the right amount. I’m not American. A north vs south game at the end of the season would be a pretty cool to watch. There isn’t anything wrong with that I'd say what you wrote appears to be exactly what they're doing ... But nothing like the dividend piece (so far maybe lol ... ). You could also argue that Abramovich did the same at Chelsea.   He booked to the club funds due to a related party for all the $s he's invested (at 0% interest and said he'd never actually call the loan ""due"").   He effectively gained a lot of leverage during the sale by doing so, which included requiring the new owners to spend 1 billion (within 10 years) ... On reflection they've easily blown that requirement out of the water.   So what's next is anyone's guess on how they plan to keep churning talent through the squad to eventually turn into annual profits. I guess it's true that it's always the ""next person's problem"" from the ownership perspective anyway you slice it.   Also before people jump in to mention it. Yes it's likely that he earned that 0% interest money and more back if he were to profit from the sale ... But that's a different topic. Yes, but the first year was undoubtedly a shitshow. Skews the metric. [deleted] Always funny when I get excited about a young player. Bummed that he already singed a contract with a future club. And happy again when I realise that club is me.  Happened more than once. -Sign Brazillian  -Loan back to end of next season  -forget about it  -2 years later: Who the fuck is this guy and then you complete the chelsea route because in the meantime you've gotten some homegrown wonderkids you've developed very nice but you have to make space for those sweet brazilian youngsters. I can do it in Fifa while spending $0 in transfer fees by simply signing every good 16 year old free agent Lol so he's probably just guessed.  I only went off his original post. Lmfao Very frustrating that as soon as tuchel left we implemented the exact structure that he would have wanted to work under https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_football_clubs_in_England_by_competitive_honours_won I just went off this one which removes any obscure ones.  So the only thing Clearlake have achieved is taking the 4th most successful club into 5th. They were big spenders to get out of the championship We're not on this list because of our spending in the Championship, we're about to enter our 8th season in the league at a time when prices have sky rocketed, our Championship spending is miniscule comparatively to the amount spent in the Premier League You comment or FFP? > i looked it up just to get the numbers right, they spent £280m NET when the PL transfer record was £29,1m  It was £120m net in 03-04 and £90m net in 04-05. £210m. I assume you've fallen for transfermarkt's notoriously bad figures that are translated from euros.  The issues will also be in this thread's main graphic, but much smaller since the exchange rate hasn't fluctuated near as much since. Pointless argument really, but they're basically similar levels of spend. It's objectively correct, and the only thing I think Spurs and Arsenal fans can agree on. I would take an extra UCL in exchange for those league titles in a heartbeat. Not an accurate comparison, Chelsea were already an established Champions League and title winning team by then. They weren't trying to climb the ladder by weakening the teams above them, they were just a world class team trying to sign world class players like any other That was years later though, they'd won titles and been in the Champions League for years by then. They weren't signing Stones to intentionally undermine Everton. Signing Lescott was an intentional attempt to weaken a Everton team that was a potential threat to them Yeah, he is simply a war profiter that sold his country's resources to the highest bidder. You lot keep defending him even after all this time. It's pathetic. I think looking at how the season went, they got one of their highest scoring totals ever but shipped goals far too easily.  So the attackers and midfielders who played significant minutes should be rated well but the CBs and Gks who played a lot should not be.  (With the exception of Chalobah who turned the defence around when he came back from injury at the end and is way underrated in general) I think I specifically said that we all know Real can and will splash cash but right now it seems far more likely they just have a player run their contract down. Which I guess is 5D chess from Chelsea with the 10 year contacts.  Maybe I'm not online enough, but I've literally never heard anyone claim that Clearlake is genius. Even people who dont absolutely hate the new owners think its a gamble. They just are more hopeful it will work out than most of the subreddit. I don't support either team, so have no bias either way.   If we go off the infographic, Spurs have spent the 5th most. I would imagine their average position over the period in question is probably 6th. I think at best, that's probably about where you'd expect (particularly with the stadium), and at worst is slightly underachieving.   I think the job Wenger did during the stadium financing years, until the last couple where it started to unravel a bit, was genuinely incredible. And a lot of the criticism he received for ""settling for top 4"" or not winning trophies completely disregarded the financial constraints he was under. One of my absolute favourite teams of all time is the 07/08 Arsenal team that definitely played the best football in the league whilst United and Chelsea were probably at or around their peaks in the history of their clubs. And that was with players like Fabregas, Flamini, Adebayor, Van Persie, Toure, Clichy etc playing incredibly well, who cost absolute peanuts. That's half a title challenging team that cost less than £10m.   I just admire that Tottenham have been able to establish themselves amongst the big teams without having state backing, which really no one else has done. And I don't think Arsenal overachieving in one era should mean Spurs have massively underachieved in another.   I know Arsenal are below them overall, but they've had points like now where they've been able to compete at the very top with transfer fees (e.g. Rice), and the early 2000s where they could do the same with wages (e.g. Sol Campbell being the first £100k/week player in the league). >  but tend to play this off by acting like they’ve always been closer in resources to the likes of Villa, Newcastle and Everton.  The only reason we're not is that we're much better run. [deleted] Have they got ""absolutely nothing to show for it"" or have they got 26 trophies? You're not a meme. I've supported Charlton since the 80s. In the 90s we were bouncing back from oblivion, and thanks to Alan Curbishley, were able to piece together a low-budget team that was consistently in the Championship play-offs. When he eventually got us up, we yo-yoed and eventually achieved mid-table football in the Prem. At that point our budget started going up and we were able to compete with mid-table Prem teams for players. It was all going in the right direction.      And then Roman Abramovich came along and fucked everything, completely transforming the landscape. Once he started there was no going back. For teams of Charlton's ilk - today perhaps Luton - the chances of being able to build a team in the Championship that could compete in the Prem without massive investment are long gone. I wouldn’t say that’s the case.  It’s not as if we went out and bought Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar et al. Their wikipedia page.  That was all their trophies, probably included some charity shields and whatnot who knows I just added them all up. City are an exceptionally well run football club, yes.  I personally consider both what they did and what Abramovich did to be cheating, but they did a good job of it nonetheless.  Some teams spend an absolute fortune and are still shit (current day Chelsea for example) For Arsenal, it was:  Be shit in south London > move to north London > money > more money> success > more money We were plenty successful in the 1990s and 2000s which is what made us attractive for a wealthy owner.     Sorry, I don’t think football success should only be achieved by teams who were successful in the past. So your club is fine because you had money bags 100 years ago? You guys even cheated your way out of getting relegated back then with money.    All those big clubs are built on money. Byern won the league for a decade. Clubs like Stuttgart can't sustain that success once they can't afford to pay their players. Money clubs always win in the end It's how the game has worked for my entire lifetime. Europa league isn't really relevant to this but even Europa league teams have more money than Conference league teams   in this case they were referring to money thats been spent without a trophy over the last 5 years and theyve taken expenditure for a year that hasnt happened yet. If you take the 5 year span that excludes this current window we're 5th. If / when we dont win one this year you can come back with us being in 2nd place It’s so funny because if you listen to the media and fans they constantly say the owners don’t back the managers but then they’ll say about how much Arteta has been backed. In reality we just made better signings than them and they waste a lot of money on a larger amount of small signings that get more forgotten. Hope so too, I’m not optimistic about our chances for top 4, our midfield and attack could be good but our defence looks set to be poor. Not happy about losing Gallagher, realistically I think he wouldn’t have started for us anyway but he still is a useful player, and his whole family bleeds blue. It’s a disgrace how he’s being treated  Yeah, the reason we’ve spent so much is overspending on mediocre talent, which led to more overspending to compensate. On the side, they’re trying to buy and sell youngsters like they’re down at the local market which also adds up. > ""The people with the real power in all this mess is the people with a controlling interest. And last time I checked it was Clearlake co-founded by Boehly…oh no that’s right it’s Eghbali.""   It was literally mandated during the sale that despite having more than 50% ownership, Clearlake could never have more than 49% voting power when it came to the running of the club or else the club wouldn't have been sold to them Right but you said he has nothing to do with how the club is being run. Which is absolutely ludicrous considering he's the chairman and co owner and all the other reasons I said. He's the most influential man in the club, arguably alongside Eghbali but that's it. There are too many matches scheduled as is and nobody would give a fuck Abramovich did a lot of things as well as you rightly point out, but at the same time the rules were completely different back then and he was a trailblazer in the money revolution game in the PL.  An owner with that kind of money is never a saint, but compared to how many other owners are in the PL today he was one of the better ones.  Yes his legacy is tarnished by how it ended with the sanctions and the forced sale for sure - but how much damage did the way the club being sold that way actually do and would have been avoided if it was a normal sale?  And I literally can't believe I am trying to defend Abramovich, considering the grief he and Mourinho caused for a fan of the red side of Manchester lol. Leicester had the best squad in Championship history last season, and were widely expected not just to win the league, but to challenge Reading's points record (106).  On top of still having the remnants of a Champions League qualifying team, it had enormous investment, to the point that they were in breach of Premier League PSR standards. However, Leicester's lawyers were successfully able to make the case that breaches taking place in the Premier League couldn't be used to punish a team in the Football League.   Furthermore, they achieved a blistering run of results in 2023, being a monstrous 12 points clear going into 2024.  And then Maresca's tactics started to be figured out. Essentially, a conservative passing style where they pick apart the opposition's defence, and then hold back and defend once they have the lead, attacking only to exploit chances on the break. There was no plan B when teams set up to counter this approach. Leicester were just going to play their game and bank on the superiority of their players making it work.  Usually this was enough, of course. Leicester did win the league after all. But their twelve point lead went down and down - there was a period starting in February where they got 10 points from 10 games, an abysmal return for a side that had hadn't dropped that many points in the whole season up to that point. Because their tactics had been figured out. Even teams scrapping to stay up like Plymouth, QPR, and Millwall found ways to beat Leicester.  His substitutions were invariably too little, too late - in a game during this period, Ipswich went 1-0 down shortly before 60 mins in a home game against Bristol City. McKenna responded with a quick quadruple substitution, basically swapping out the entire attacking line, and turned that game around to win 3-2. You won't find a comparable story from Maresca, because he would hardly ever make subs before 75 mins, and usually after 80, no matter how obvious it was that a change was needed.  He didn't respond well to this turndown either on the pitch or on the mic, truly like a budget Pep he would sing the praises of the worst players on the pitch and blame random bullshit for losses instead. Infamously he complained about the long journey to Plymouth after losing there, which is not just something every team that goes there has to deal with, but a problem he made worse by insisting that the squad travel back North to Leicester from Millwall where they had played a few days prior.  They really looked dead at the end of that run, but basically pulled themselves together just in time to profit from a classic Leeds late-season collapse (their 4-0 capitulation to QPR probably being the most astonished I've been watching a match) and win the title by one point.  Most owners would have sacked Maresca before that late revival. Chelsea's owners DEFINITELY would have sacked him before it. I basically give him no credit for getting the team to turn things around. That team won the league despite his tired tactics and awful game management, not because of him. ""Of course I know him, he is me!"" You could also just sign every superstar with 6 months left on their contract. You can pre sign an entire world XI of free agents in 2-3 seasons (assuming you have the wage budget). I didn’t guess. I didn’t realise the 35 signings for Chelsea were only permanent ones. I thought it included loans so I counted them for the other teams. I’ve corrected it now. Thats my point ¿Por que no los dos? They where not a champions league winning team wtf.   Kind of hypocritical to say it's not a fair comparison. City where weakening the competition to climb the ladder, but Chelsea weren't weakening their competition so they couldn't catch them after spending like no one before? City where getting premier league tested players to win the league from the same teams where buying premier league tested players to win the league.  Don't know how you can have issues with what City did and not Chelsea who did the same or worse. Yeah that’s a fair point You brought him up you muppet, how's your billionaires ethics? Genius might be putting it hyperbolically, but far too many people are putting these dickhead owners over the players—especially our senior players who graduated from the academy. B & C tier European trophies, and a title count that pales in comparison to Everton and Villa, like I said no one’s taking Spurs 1 extra trophy. [deleted] Are you going to compare attendances to billionare sugar daddies? Please  No one would complain if Chelsea got their money from a bigger stadium You mean that claim that there has been found no evidence for and that to my knowledge, no one called foul play at when it happened in 1919? I'm sorry that Arsenal have managed to stay up since then, would have been much better if we also got relegated like every other club from that season so people wouldn't bring up this over a century later. There's plenty of big clubs from that era that failed because the difference in money wasn't as big as it is today thanks to team like Chelsea inflating the prices with external cash Ok I get what you’re saying. And we’ll see how you do this year  But on our side lot of the money they invested in is youth, some who got injured and are only fit now, and a large portion has been spent either on players that aren’t here yet, or whose sole purpose is to be sold later for a profit and potentially never play for the club.   So we can criticise that aspect of it for sure, including massive overpays on players who are in the first team. But if we’re gonna break it down in that way I think what I’m saying is fair too. Still, I know we’re on a level of our own that’s clear Tbf with how Palmer was playing toward the backend of last season, you're gonna score a lot of goals. It's just whether you can keep them out or not.   Shame about Gallagher, he seemed like one of the ones willing to fight for the shirt when I was watching your games last season, has an insane work rate.   Tbf Chelsea helped us with PSR so can't knock you too much! No no. Don't let reality get in the way of this guys' defense of Boehly. They were an established Champions League team and a title winning team  And Liverpool were nowhere near Chelsea when they signed Torres and went after Gerrard, and City were nowhere near winning titles when they signed those players, their target then was 4th  I never said I don't have issues with Chelsea, but I do think a team using new found wealth trying to get from mid-table to Champions League by specifically trying to sign key players from the 4th, 5th and 6th best times is particularly gross Spurs are self-sustaining, not reluant on some billionaire's cheating graces. You can't have a conversation without name calling? How old are you? [deleted] lol Highbury’s capacity was 38,000 So if Chelsea bought their place 100 years ago it would be ok? Out of curiosity, What titles had they won? So are Chelsea you muppet Why are you trying to compare a vote to a billionare pumping in hundred of millions of his own money into a team until they started winning? **The** title, 2 years in a row. I'm guessing you mean Cole cause it was first, if you meant Torres then 3 times They are clearly not, you donkey. Read the thread. So only the big clubs that already have money should be allowed to compete? Dude, just stop. Chelsea wasn't just leveling the playing field. They leveled the playing field and then build a huge skyscaper on top of it So you're just mad that they spent money and you have more competition now? Nah, spurs also spend more money and is in the competition now, except they did it without a rich sugar daddy like Chelsea and I can't complain about that Didn't Man United have a sugar daddy when they got big? Why specifically is it Chelsea that is the bad team? Who are you refering to? Weren't they called Newton Heath until a group of rich dudes bought them and then they won the league a few years later? I mean now you're just grasping at straws here, those guys saved from bankruptcy, hardly the same as investing hundreds of millions to win titles. But I'm down with your clownery now, good bye"
"Borussia Dortmund have received all the bonus payments(€43m) from Barcelona for Ousmane Dembéle. Total transfer fee: €148m.","2024-09-12T11:05:20+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fezubv/borussia_dortmund_have_received_all_the_bonus/","[No textual content]","6333","kibme37","https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/barca-acabado-pagando-148-millones-108042999","It has cost around 800 thousand euro per match played. One of the bargains of the century. Thanks, bye! Nobita Bartomeu’s legacy lives on. Watzke played him like a fiddle by telling Barto that he had a plane to catch and if Barca wanted Dembele they would have to pay double the valuation of the Spanish club which was  $193 million.  Any sane man would walk away but Nobita agreed immediately to pay it. Galaxy brain move. One of the worst transfers of all time easily. We were offered to sign Mbappé at that time and Barto rejected it 🤡 Good business ! Dortmund and Benfica are elite scammers lmao. How are Barca so bad with money? Bartomeu legacy still lives on [deleted] What were the bonuses which got activated for Barca to play 43 million?   I can understand certain appearance related bonuses and winning the league but surely they wont add upto 40 million something.  what else?   A 100 million player scoring against Barcelona in the champions league quarter final clause? Ching Ching! The gift that keeps on giving When I watched Barcelona and Dembele play I could see flashes of what was possible for him, but from my perspective it seemed like he has less football IQ than his abilities needed. He'd move faster than his brain could think of what to do, which sounds worse than I mean it too. I could see what he was trying to do at times, but he'd run himself into corners or see a pass a second too late and it'd look awful when it was given away. He'd fluff his lines as well....perfect example being that miss against Liverpool to make it 4-0 at Camp Nou.    His time was interrupted by injures, although he did have a couple good seasons and did have a knack for popping up with important goals at times. His second season 18/19 was probably the best of the lot, which is also an indictment because he didn't really improve on that.   People remember this transfer because even though Barcelona did win the league a few times while he was there, he was part of the teams that collapsed in Europe.    It's one of the worst transfers in Spanish football history and for Barcelona well.....either him, Griezmann or Coutinho.    It's not the worst ever in Spanish history though, for that you only need to look at Eden Hazard. For all the faults of the Barcelona three, you could at least see flashes of what was possible when they played and while Griezmann (for example) didn't live up to expectations he did play relatively well. It's just that their decent play didn't live up to their monstrous fee. In comparison Eden Hazard became a complete irrelevance and it is a credit to Madrid that they were able to overcome the complete albatross that was that transfer and be able to keep winning. Sweet sweet money The thing is at the time this was seen as an acceptable price especially with the cost being so spread out. It was years before covid and the club's projectory for growth was high and expected. Most importantly, Dembele's ceiling was judged to be close to Mbappe's. He was absolutely phenomenal at Dortmund, consistent, no major injuries, noone expected things to go this way. He did what vinicius was doing at a lesser club while being younger, he just didn't improve as much and couldn't stay injury free Still better than the Hazard trade for us [deleted] We made it! 😭🙏🏽 And when he's tearing it up in MLS you'll say it was worth it. It could be 1.48b and Dortmund would still claim they have no money to buy players. Worth every (third) penny. Deal of the century Thanks for the Bartonomics lessons. Now it’s to complete the Ferran deal, I guess ! noobbb You mean that transfer that happened in 2018? Man Barca really went through the rough Barca can afford it Don't remind me of that fraud😭 How do Dortmund not have huge money to attack the transfer market with all the money they have brought in from sales on Dembele, Sancho, Bellingham and Haaland?   Or have they spent it and they are just bad in the market too? The best thing about this is that the nonsense of ""pull"" takes a dent and clubs will probably stop paying ""whatever it takes"". Reasonable amount or keep the player. This made me lol Wait... BARCA??? Lil late for that innit? Lil late for that innit? Thank you, come again. No tip? Fantastic bit of business. Another banger of a deal for them worst transfer ever, stupid thing to put a bonus on performances at international level where it doesn't help the club in any way Mental. Wow After the kind of stunt Barcelona pulled during the transfer, the whole thing being a gigantic loss for them is pure karma. man barcelona made some all time stupid transfers all in a very short period of time Well, it was worth every euro. He is a core member of Barcelona's attack, and has scored numerous important goals for them in the UCL. Coutinho,dembele,griezman robbed barca. This might be the most useless transfer from a big club in history   He wasnt even that good to be worth so much and still isnt Dembele and Coutinho combined is one of the worst uses of money the game has seen. Almost €2.4 million per goal or assist. More than twice as much per g/a that PSG got out of Neymar, and that was hardly an unmitigated success Fucking hell, is that considering his wages or just the fee? Athletico Madrid look at that and wonder how they could get such value out of Joao Felix. After wages easily €1 million per match Absolute steal, considering Jean-Kevin Augustin cost us £800k per minute. Didn't they get 50 million for him though?  Excluding wages that's about 500k/match. Obviously even *more* of a bargain. That’s cheap though, Madrid payed €2M per match for Hazard. So you guys must have a pretty big warchest at this point? What did y’all do with this money ? see you in december  Watzke played a simple negotiating tactic using time/deadline as a driver, you think an experienced businessman such as Bartomeu would not fall for such a tactic.....funnily enough Dortmund would have been happy to walk away with a £70m deal. You are getting sued mate. RIP Watzke took our club from the brink of death pack to the elite of Europe   One of the best club managers in recent football history  Handing out money like you don’t have a debt of 1 billion  lmao this is literally how i used to barter with vendors at the market, except the other direction obviously. absolute jokes if this is true. Hey don't insult Nobita like that. DORAEMON! Nobita? Gian? Suniyo? Shizuka? https://i.imgur.com/mnRl99a.jpeg Tbf Dembele looked like an absolute world beater at Dortmund. Honestly thought he had Ballon D’Or type upside. Shame injuries and his alleged poor professionalism stood in the way.  FACTS! Nobita? Gian? Suniyo? Shizuka? [deleted] And yet, not only was it not the worst of Barca's 100m+ transfers, it might have even been the least bad of them The cherry on top was that his form finally turned around under Xavi, who was hoping to build the team around him. There were times when he looked like a genuine world-beater, and he left for PSG moments later. Not for Dortmund A certain hamburger enthusiast you sold us was a bigger disappointment. Dembele at least played and when he did was an insane baller, shame about the injuries. i’ll keep saying this he was a pretty good player for Barca. in his first and third season he was mostly injured but in the other 4 seasons he was mostly good especially with Xavi. Sure the transfer fee was too much but he’s the least bad out of most tham (antony, Hazard, Groezmann, Felix, Coutinho…. were all worse) That summer had 4 of the top 5 worst transfers or something   Hazard > Griezmann > Coutinho > Dembouz from a sporting perspective? definitely   from a football meme perspective? *vamos dembélé* The mid to late 2010s is filled with some of the worst transfers of all time. Disagree. One of the best transfers Zorc ever did for us ( : Dembele isn’t even close to being as bad as what your clubs transfer’s in the last 2 years have been. Not only that but I think he was gonna be cheaper than Dembele too. Mbappe and and his family even gave the green light and decided Barca was the move for him. All for Barca higher ups to say “what has Mbappe even achieved” and picked Dembele who was seen as more proven at the time. Why even want Mbappé, he’s so washed /s > We were offered to sign Mbappé at that time and Barto rejected it    Is that true? I never heard of it. What kind of transfer fee would it have involved?  So there might be an alternative timeline in which Barca signed Mbappe and have enough money to sign Haaland from Dortmund and end up with a front line of Mbappe, Haaland and Yamal? No joke if Dembele had half a braincell, he would consistently be one of the top10 players in the world.  Absolutely gifted on the pitch, absoluted cooked outside of it and a lot of stuff going around off the pitch to be ready FOR the pitch. Tbf, the Dembele deal was under Bartomeu, and there were a ton of bad deals during that time. Bruv he was signed 7 years ago Because it is a popularity contest, you will only run the club if you are popular with the fans, fans will  like you more if you sign the best players… All those levers and no instruction manuals. They at least got €50m for his sale. They only got £17m for Coutinho. Him or Coutinho they just competing with themselves This was a bit shocking from the start, there were also very bad outcomes in transfers like Hazard or Coutinho, but they were experienced and established stars by the time, whereas Dembele was just a talent. Big one, but not near 100mn. Probably not even Barça's worst transfer of that summer - and with that flair you should know that particularly well 500k per hospital visit Wouldn’t say nothing. He’s had a very good career, playing at the highest levels of football. Perhaps he’s ok with not being the best and all the sacrifices that come with that. Some people value work-life balance more than greatness. Have you seen Sancho at United? he doesn't care, some people are in just for the money. and a lot of people are like this, no matter the job. it's just a job, not a passion. Colorado Rapids legend Including that type of transfers they still fluctuate around half of Bayern's revenue (sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit less, depending on transfers). Not all profitable transfers are this huge so it's not revenue they can expect every year.  They still need to pay their players solid wage (again, around half of Bayern's) to stay at the top of the Bundesliga and they also have to   get new players in to replace those who left. And after those big transfers other clubs know that they got more of a budget to play with so the money gets used in some way and is not just pure profit.   Sometimes they make good transfers, and sometimes they don't. Overall still rather good (or they'd not be playing at that level and in the CL). The club is at a level where the transfers they get in also cost a lot so they can't rely on only cheap transfers (or their quality would suffer) that might develop into once in a lifetime players. If one of those transfers doesn't work out it still cost a lot of money. And that's money that's not necessarily coming in regularly (but depends on them hitting the jackpot occasionally).  The club is overall debt free, or the debt they have isn't holding them back like it did before (like over a decade ago) when they essentially had to give players cheap release clauses to get them to agree to comparatively low wages so the club could slowly improve (which meant that they lost a lot of good player for cheap).  These days the club is way more stable but they can't rely on the volatility of their super transfers for consistency. Those occasional big transfers are outliers and can't have a too direct effect on their transfer strategy.  Something like that is what caused their financial difficulties in the past (late 90s). In short: The club bet on continued CL success for increased revenue and more big transfers (to become better fast). It didn't work out and led to the financial difficulties they had until somewhat recently. They are probably trying to not repeat that part of their history. COVID and some bad transfers I reckon. We don't splash like 50m€ on one player, but rather 25m€ on 2-3 players. If oyu think about it, our biggest transfer in club history is 35m€, 15 of which were paid by Puma directly. So without Puma our biggest signing was Haller with 30.5m€ thats incredibly low if you think about it. Even Wolfsburg and Leipzig already paid more for players than we did. Oh I think Barça got the tip… 😏 Dortmund haven’t done anything either except continue being trophyless Hazard had 4 goal in 54 app for Real Madrid when he was supposed to be Ronaldos replacement, he didnt get sold unlike Dembele and even after his retirement Real Madrid still had to pay addons to Chelsea. Nah, Hazard takes the cake for worst transfer I dont think anybody received a demonstration of how Dembele did without his injury record Eden Hazard existed to take that mantle I may be wrong but antony costs 7.3 million per G+A Malcom did barely anything too but they were lucky that some club splashed the money on him again Barcelona were using the Neymar money. They didn't think they would have egg thrown at their face. Dembele was a panic buy; nearly last day of the transfer window. Liverpool also didn't want to sell Coutinho. Hold my beer: Boehly maybe Dembele wasn't bad for Barca. Overpriced? Yes. But Dembele's biggest sin was that he wasn't Neymar, who he was directly replacing that summer. Just the fee lol Madrid paid Chelsea £5 million after Hazard had already retired. Value transfer that They're still stuck with Lemar, who goes under the radar when people talk about failed la liga transfers Athletico... just say Atleti man ""Athletico""  How to piss of 2 fan bases with one word. All these transfers are cause some rich club came by and spent silly money on one of their star players. Wasn't Felix signed cause of Griezman or something? Barcelona paid 110 million for him. That money went to Felix. There was just an article in Kicker that Dortmund made in 10 years a little over 1 billion from selling players and spent on buying players ~900million. Idk they couldn’t even afford ian maataen. Perpetually selling players for 80m plus yet somehow perpetually broke Bottle a couple Bundesligas. As much as I hate to admit it at least Liverpool did something (lot more than something) with Coutinho's money. I dont think Dortumnd would have sold for 70 - I dont think they wanted to lose both Auba and Dembele in same year. That said Barca should not have paid up for Dembele. Some combination of what they already had should have done the job. Imagine dortmund the last five years missing that 60 or so Million. Hans-Joachim knows ball. Once you’ve racked up that big of a bill what’s another 100+ million? To be honest this time they had the money. They had too many money even A 1mil debt its ur problem. A 1b debt its the bank’s problem But hey, you can get into a bigger debt, and pay that old debt. Infinite money trick. Laporta is miles better lmao. He doesn't even have to be particularly good to be miles better. He is, in fact, A LOT better. It almost certainly was. Certainly was miles better than the Coutinho transfer. Did they have to pay the bonus for the CL win for Coutinho? No Griezmann was better Honestly which 100M+ transfers are considered a success. I feel that they fail more than they should, or maybe the expectations are waay too high Griezmann and Coutinho were worse for sure I think considering their stats, for what number they got sold and what happened i think the order from best to worst is Griezmann>Dembele>Coutinho He left for us, and to really take the piss even more he decided that being injured was not worth it anymore and that playing somewhat of a leader role was actually quite nice. Still plays like he's always flipping a coin but that's actually quite a useful skill to have to break down low blocks, hard to predict what he's gonna do as a defender when the attacker has no fucking clue either. The whole comment subthread is just dramatic to be honest. I mean let's be serious. Dude was still sold for a high fee six years older, and went on to play regularly in PSG and get a lot of praise in Ligue 1, just as he did in La Liga in several seasons.  He wasn't the best in the world like some had hoped and of course a disappointment, but please can people read that description and be serious... There was obviously a TON of transfers that went worse than that. If one of the world's biggest clubs pays to sign the guy after 6 years, it's not close to the WORST transfer evel lol. Not worse than Hazard Still a great signing compared to hazard. Is the meme ""Dembélé 11 minutos tardes' used in Spain? I have seen it used in non football related french discord server. Certainly one of the decision of all time It was in 2017 when neymar left. Him and people around him would accept the move to Barcelona.  I dont know exact number he would cost back then but he was cheeper than Dembélé but Bartomeu rejected him due to not being much proven and chose dembele instead.  [here is short article about it](https://barcauniversal.com/barcelona-were-close-to-signing-kylian-mbappe-in-2017-reveals-former-director/) It's not like it's that much better now.   Got olmo instead of a player in a position they need. Signing Vitor Roque early for 40m euro in january then spending all window trying to ship him out. The not so small fortune they are paying lewandowski is baffling to me. And it's only getting worse as he ages What do you mean? Barto was a legend. He was treated so unfairly by the fans.  Truly a generational president. There are a ton of bad deals with Laporta. They're just as bad now. Constantly borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, all the while mortgaging off chunks of the club's assets. All because they won't accept 2/3 seasons of not competing for La Liga (I would say the CL but they haven't competed for that in ages). It was the last Bad signing right? ... Right? So that's where Chelsea got their inspiration. I wonder if this is more so the international Barca fan base This happened before the levers era Barcelona only got like 35M of that 50m, the rest went into his and his agent's pockets Half of that sale was pocketed by Dembele Dembele also had much more of a positive impact than Coutinho ever did, at times he did seem like Barcelona's best performing winger  Coutinho would have been a net negative even if he came for free, his biggest legacy in his time with Barcelona is scoring twice against them to make it 8-2 Hazard was worse so na. Coutinho was not a summer transfer. He came to barcelona in the winter of 2018 lol [deleted] Participation award Or Ravel Morrison lmao  Or Balotelli... dortmund and barça's ambitions - especially at the time the transfer happened - are not of the same stature Dortmund didn't go broke at least When you put it like that i guess he is worse but atleast Hazard at the time was sure to be a sucess while dembele was one of many supposed promissing players and to this day he's just good at best Alisson cost Liverpool £16.7m per g+a what a fraud Calculated it and it’s ‘only’ 5.9million.. 🙂 Sure, but you can’t put a price on aura Jean-Kevin Augustin - £42m total outlay for no goals and no assists Truly the goat. That’s why he’s the goat 🐐 Pretty sure that was all lined up before hand. Bartemou did some shady shit to move payments around to meet FFP regulations.  Coutinho was one of the best players in the premier league. No one thought that was even an outrageous deal. It might have been 20% over what they'd like but many clubs would have been in for him. he was injured Blimey. Not even their worst 100m+ signing either At least Hazard didn't beat Real 8-2 while he was still getting paid by them [deleted] In here we just call it Patético.  Funny how often people botch either Athletic or Atletí, although makes sense with most users being anglos I see. Considering most big clubs have negative net spend that’s really good The on field success of that 900m, particularly relative to their domestic competition is pretty disappointing tbh The question is, why dont you keep the players? You could've had the best team in the world, but you sell and do what with the money? That's what happens when you don't have an Oil Daddy to inject money into a team lnfao German clubs don't print money as easily as the EPL does. BvB made less money from their TV deal last year than the teams relegated from the Prem.   What they do have is a massive stadium, so the loss of all those ticket sales during covid was a huge deal they are only just now really climbing out from under.   They also had near financial disaster not that long ago and are now publicly traded so they tend to behave rather conservatively when it comes to taking risks with money.  Which is all a long way to say that the profit from those sales wasn't pure extra cash to spend on transfers like it would be to lots of other teams, some of it had to be used to cover regular expenses. Don’t win anything too most of the time so prize money is less too Other way around. Auba threw a tantrum and was sold because Dembele was sold (Watzke had promised to Auba to not sell Dembele) What’s the old saying? Owe the bank a million and you have a problem, owe the bank a billion and they have a problem *Much money Not to rub it in, but my favorite part of the Coutinho transfer wasn't even the money. It was how seemingly prophetic Klopp's statement was about how things would turn out. He said that he told Coutinho: ""Stay here and they'll build a statue of you. Go there and you'll be just another player."" Not only was it largely accurate performance-wise but, even worse, he won't even be remembered as ""just another player"" but as the symbol of how disastrously Barca has been run for much of the last decade. Of course, since we improved so much without the rest of the squad depending on Phil to do something, maybe he wouldn't have ended up getting the statue, either...? No they didn't have to pay the bonus for a champions League win because it only counted if they won it. There were rumours that they would but the contract specified barca winning the cl not him. Griezmann carried us to COVID CdR but ehh. Dembele was great during 22/23 and we actually won La Liga and Super Cup. Bale was 100 millies on the dot. I think that one can be safely considered to have been worth it, if for nothing else than for the fact that his goals were the decision makers of two CL finals Kane to Bayern seems to be rather successful  Mbappe I'd say Bellingham was worth it for Real Madrid. Mbappe, Rice, Jude, Kane seem like great transfers. Bale was still important for Madrid so I would jot that down as good one, similar to Ronaldo to Juve because his transfer had weird timing (as juve was on the down) even if he gave them 3 good years. Grealish was not a disaster at least since he went on a heater in business end of treble winning season but seems like a bad transfer outside of that.   Bunch of disasters tho - Dembele, Hazard, Lukaku, Couthino,... Lmfaooo. I actually love how delusional a lot of you fans who have never kicked a ball are so comfortable trash talking one of the best wingers in the world. Sure he’s not as decisive in the final third as vini or even now yamal, but to say he’s clueless is just fucking dumb. You dont start on France, Barca or psg having no idea what you’re doing on attack. There are many top teams he could walk into no problem. undoubtedly, which is why madrid didnt sign any 100m+ players for five seasons after him  meanwhile barcelona signed two even more expensive players within a year of dembélé, and somehow both of them worked out even worse >olmo  I was skeptical but he has been fantastic and the way our game changed from the minute he came in tells me he might have actually been needed. Barca spent closed to 450m for 3 players who flopped by all standards. They are much better now. It's way better now. Olmo has been hugely helpful, and they did need him. And acting like that is anywhere near the disaster that was any of the Coutinho/Greaseman/Dembele transfers is ridiculous. Olmo has been fantastic so far, and Lewy wages are high but he is always a worst case top 2 scorer in the league Lewa is in his last year of the deal and already got 4 goals and an assist in 4 games, Olmo is looking like a great signing and all 3 of Yamal, Raphinha and Olmo can switch to Left Wing only Roque is baffling trying to get rid of him but atleast we let him on loan to Betis. Its mile better now, its not even comparable. Anybody who tries to argue the opposite is just ignorant on the situation Do you actually think anything they're doing right now is anywhere near as bad as Griezman, Dembele and fucking Coutinho for 400 million euro back when that was even more money than it is now? Eh, I'd say they're slightly better, but there's still a ton of room for improvement. There hasn't been another deal quite as bad as Coutinho or Dembele under Laporta, but the borrowing & the 'levers' did raise a lot of questions. From the outside, it still looks like there's a lot of financial mismanagement, but I guess we'll see. No but the ratio of good/bad signings has improved in last few years Depends. What do you think of Barca spending its entire summer budget on Dani Olmo?? How many international members are there? 25, it was 50% Coutinho's greatest legacy is his sale funding Liverpool's rebuild I'd take Hazard not doing anything during his stay here rather than loaning a player out and have him contribute to 3 goals in the worst defeat of Barça's recent history Fair enough actually, thought it was in the same market No way did he contribute more than Dembele. Dembele was our best winger, finished top assister of 21/22 La Liga season. And several other trophies in 3 of the 5 big leagues and National team. He isn't Neymar, he's baffling in many ways, but a lot of top coaches have seen his value.   There aren't any wingers of his profile and the fact he can be so effective whilst being so technically inconsistent is testament to the value of genuinely being ambipedal. And not much has changed since then Easier not to go broke when you’re a selling club and a feeder for your biggest rival. All those “sales” and jack squat to show for it except for being a punching bag with zero trophies Exactly he's trash that's why we got mamadashvili to replace him Let's see. Most other keepers are undefined. God Allison can't even be undefined like the rest of them. What a scam. And with deductions it's only 1, so you can avoid sanctions Don’t forget all the legal fees. Probably an additional million or two lmao. He thrived in a team that was built to get the best out of him. He was never going to be the main man at Barcelona with Messi, Iniesta  still there.   Similarly with Hazard. Madrid bought him to replace Ronaldo and Hazard was never a renown goal scorer. He was a 10 who played out on the left and with freedom. He wasn’t known for assisting like De Bruyne either. He could create space for other players and he was a good dribbler. But again different skill sets that suited their previous teams.  He was overrated. He wasn't worth anywhere near what they paid for him. But hazard 8-2 much during his time at madrid. Or 8-2 This isn’t r/madridistas Pretty much outside of Real Madrid, and the known development clubs like Dortmund, PSV, Porto, all other big clubs have a really negative balance on the books. Let's not forget that Dortmund had a pretty nice team built under Tuchel, and then some psychopath decided to bomb our team bus forcing a chain of events that led to that entire team leaving Dortmund over the next couple of years and Tuchel getting fired for handling the media poorly after the whole situation. It takes skill to be this bad consistently. Eh, some of that money went into transfers for Bellingham, Kobel, Schlotterbeck, Hummels, Brandt, Haaland, Sancho, Füllkrug, Sabitzer. Sure we also had a lot of expensive flops, but overall we're doing fine. Clubs have spent their money worse. I mean that 900m or not, we were still battling an all-time era from a team that had almost 3x operative budget still.  So believe it or not, mathematically we shouldnt have won domestically despite that income. because they almost went bankrupt 20 years ago Plus, you know, just had to buy Nmecha! they waste a lot of their money too tho Why do you need cash injections to buy players, with that sort of transfer revenue?  Dortmund surely also have a decent commercial revenue, and not a very high wage bill?  Where has the money gone? fair enough but even before covid they were selling players like lewandowski, auba etc. for a lot Yea, I could be wrong. Dortumnd did sell bunch of players years before, so it might be that they didnt want to lose spine of the team in back to back seasons. Anyway I remember them being like ""we are not selling except for unreasonable sum"" and then Barca paid an unreasonable sum. lmfaooo exactly, if you're gonna go in debt, go so deep down that the gov has to come rescue you In for a penny, in for a billion pound Pool should still build a statue for him. Man single handedly revitalized the club with his transfer fee. That quote was proper bullshit. Suarez is now more of a Barca legend than Liverpool legend. Mascherano and Alonso too. Coutinho had the stage set for him at Barca to shine, but he flopped. If he played well in Barca he could've still be there even today (he's only just 32) and could have been a Barca legend like Suarez. Personally that quote from Klopp never made any sense to me. Plenty of players such as Mascherano, Suarez, Alonso and many more left Liverpool and went on to become legends for their future clubs. Coutinho not succeeding was more down to Barto chasing a big name signing that never fit in Barca's lineup. We reportedly sold the last debt and obligations related to that transfer to a bank for few years ago anyway, before he went on loan to Bayern.  The club wanted the cash immediately and were worried about Barca's financial situation.  There was like €15m of add ons left that we sold to a bank for about €10m to get guaranteed cash in. Bale was crucial in winning a CL and a CdR final, that’s money well spent right there. If by success you mean transferring the curse and Bayern going trophyless a whole season since god knows when, sure I guess. Considering that Mbappe was signed to win the UCL with Neymar I wouldn't say he was a success. The success rate is pretty bad. Hopefully Rice and Bellingham keep balling  If we adjust for inflation to get 100m pounds then CR7 easily counts and that is arguably the most successful transfer of all time especially considering they got like £88m back   Seems like the pattern is only spend that money if they’re highly driven, professional and not injury prone Maybe I'm being stupid here but I feel that's still way too early to call considering the money spent on him. So far obviously absolutely worth it and very high chance that this will not change even like 5 years from now but it's not guaranteed. 100+mil transfers should be judged on more than 1 season. Nobody said he's terrible or anything, but he's still not playing like a 150m player, he's still inconsistent, he's still not effective enough in the final third, and at no point I would have named him at a top 10 winger which was the minimum expectation for his potential and price (really if he lived up to his talent he could have been the world's best winger).  That doesn't mean he's trash or not a useful footballer, but he's a definitive disappointment compared to the money paid for him (transfer and wages) and his potential. I literally praise him for being very good at destabilising low blocks in my comment. I love him as a player and am glad we bought him, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna turn a blind eye to his weaknesses. He's an instinct player and you can see that by the fact that he very often dribbles to dribble and not with an actual idea behind it besides beating his man. Think somebody needs a reminder that criticising a player is perfectly normal and happens in every age group in grassroots football because that's how you get better. You can count the number of right sided attackers in the world who are better than him on one hand, and even a couple of those would be debatable.  i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about dembele. u wouldnt say this shit to him on the pitch, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol The problem with Olmo ain't his level, is that he has lots of injuries Maybe transfer wise, but that’s also because they’re limited by La Liga’s wage limitations and UEFA’s FFP rules.  The stuff they’re doing selling of chunks of their revenue generating arms (to companies who then didn’t even pay them), might be even worse long term. They could have just spent a couple years building out the team from La Masia without spending massive fees and leveraging their future earnings. Instead they just…built the team from La Masia while doing all that anyways lol.   It may be a few years until we see how it unfolds, but they’ve basically built a house of cards that is fully dependent on massive TV deals coming and that may not come to fruition. It’s very possible they end up leading the push on some really fucked up things like super league etc bc they need to massively increase their revenue considering they’ve sold chunks of Barca Studio etc 450m would have been better spent on public housing in Barcelona for local residents - so that they don’t have to flip out at tourists for taking over the city when they’ve got a statue of the biggest fucking coloniser in history right there on the waterfront, oh the irony - than on any of those 3 bums. I think it's actually on a similar level given that of the transfers I mentioned, 2 of them were your only major signing that season.  You could afford to fuck up for those players because you still had a billion more to spend. You now don't have those amounts to spend any more. his deal finished in 2026. At which point Barca will be paying him 33m a year. To me thats mental Yes because they're selling off chunks of their long term assets, which will cause just as much damage. The previous deals were stupid and lead the club to where they are now but a serious club would accept the need for a few years of austerity and poor performance on the pitch to right the ship. Barcelona are not a serious club. yeah let's not talk like you don't have Lewandowski on massive wages despite an obvious decline Dani Olmo for 47m + 8m is great business. He’s a great player. Did Barca really need him? Idk but it’s a much much better deal than Dembele for 140m (!) ""entire budget"" makes it sound so atrocious. For instance, we paid the entire transfer budget(whopping 5.4M) on Romeu last summer. Pissed me off Laporta agreed to a clause like that on his contract when no club in Europe even wanted that guy anymore his stocks were rock bottom Atleast coutinho was good for 6 months, hazard contributed absolutely nothing and was on larger wages than coutinho and barca did unfortunately for us lol end up being able to sell him and as you said loan him to recoup some money, the were already getting absolutely destroyed when he came on anyway. Only one of those two teams reached the UCL final since then https://i.imgur.com/rtcaxsc.jpeg That was good. lol I forgot how bad it was I edited it What. Bayern is insanely rich? They literally paid of their stadium 2 decades before plan. With the exception of 2023 they really dont spend a lot for how much they make. Bayern is known to have an absurd amount that they dont put into buying players. What about RB Leipzig? ""How did you know i was american?"" Is there an account if that entire saga somewhere? I am a Chelsea fan, this is a skill we excel at Bellingham handed yall the Bundesliga and yall fumbled it so hard in fact, the actual trophy was at your final match.  Made a ton of money on him though guess it kinda makes up for it. That doesn't explain how Neverkusen won last season. That's a tiny drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things compared to the money tossed around by the clubs that do have Oil Daddy's and can afford to sign flop after flop   Meanwhile BVB can barely afford a bad signing once every 5 years still crying at that wasted 30 million. would have been useful Not really, no. There bad transfers in the past 5 or so years don't even total to the disaster of the Dembele deal for example. When Dortmund makes a bad decision, it's for 30 mil - when other clubs do the same, it's for far more.   There's 2 glaringly bad transfers in the past 6 years (Nmecha, Schulz), another few that 2 that are less terrible (Hazard, & Haller - though I don't think it's fair to assess it as a waste of money due to the circumstances) Actually BvB chose to keep Lewa for one more year and then let him go to Bayern for free rather that get a transfer fee.  The large signings are flashy and get attention. What doesn't get as much attention is BvB turning around and spending the money on many smaller transfers. A) We didn't sell Lewandowski. The club specifically asked him to stay for the last year.  B) There is more to selling players than ""sold for X"". A lot of money gets lost in the process. Indeed, both Hummels and Mkhi left the year before I think, so the plan was to not sell anyone. However, as you say, then Bartomeu happened The Spanish government isn't going to rescue Barcelona lmfao Tie it all together when him miming out his ""hurt"" back in the statue. Eh. That revitalization was already well under way between FSG, Michael Edwards, and Jürgen. We'd already set aside the money for Virg (part of the same ""wait and only spend for the players that we actually want"" philosophy that has returned with Edwards; see: Zubimendi) so that was happening, regardless. The Coutinho money went for Alisson, Fabinho, and (sigh) Keita. The Alisson buy may be the best thing we've done in the past 20 years, so that was definitely an upside of that sale and Fabinho was worth every penny. Keita... well, yeah. So, I don't think that sale was as transformative as most think, but it was still very positive because we landed the best keeper in the world who's going to be here for several more years. We were already a great team playing great football, we just didn’t have the results yet so other teams didn’t see how formidable the squad was becoming. I don't think Coutinho was going to be a Suarez lol that's a bit much Whaaaat he's only 32 Since you've named him I am religiously going to watch again his compilation of goals for season 15/16 and think about the good ol' times before Neymar fucked it all up He talked about coutinhuo not suarez lol Good thing he didn't say this about Suarez, Alonso or Mascherano then... I don't think Klopp said what he said just because the player was going from Liverpool to Barca. He said what he said because he knew Coutinho as a player and he knew that Barca team. He understood that Coutinho would not fit in. Not only that, but how Coutinho (and after him, Griezzmann) was going to shine with Messi having the spotlight at CAM/RW/false 9 Disagree - Is Xabi Alonso a madrid legend? From the outside he is just another world class madrid player who won loads of trophies. Not everyone can be a legend. And that was Klopps point. Yeah, I'm a Liverpool fan and it's annoying how so many seemed to have misinterpreted that whole situation or been revisionist about it. Klopp was not chasing Coutinho out with that quote, and actually got the most out of him in the half season after he twerked for Barcelona.   And the statue thing is such hyperbole that it's hilarious how many take that literally. Klopp himself is a legend but likely won't get a statue. Even bigger legends like Rush and Gerrard don't. Coutinho could've stayed the rest of his career at Liverpool, but unless he suddenly became Messi level and led them to 10 consecutive titles or something, he was never getting one either.   And Coutinho was a great servant for the club, other than that bad back nonsense in the summer of 2017, after which he didn't down tools either.  He was our one true world class player for a few seasons between Rodgers and Klopp, and made us a huge profit when he eventually left. It genuinely pisses me off when top Reds defend flops like Keita while shitting on someone who was one of our best players throughout his entire time here.  Scammed Barca and a bank, I respect the hustle. Mbappe is their top goalscorer of all time. Regardless of their lack of a UCL title, Mbappe had an incredibly successful stint at PSG. Mbappe and Neymar were absolutely crucial to PSG becoming a much more globally popular club, which is what is the main influence on their revenue.  Along with the sporting success, but it's not like ""win CL = all money, no win CL = no money"" lol. Tbh winning CL doesn't really change much for any club. FC Porto won it and it changed very little overall in what Porto's position in the world is. I'm not sure they even jumped Benfica in terms of budget for one moment, so ""signing a player to win CL"" is worth around zero euro compared to just any transfer you'd do anyway. Considering it's PSG I doubt their signings during that era focus on sporting achievments. I believe it's more of mimicking the first Galacticos with their lopsided frankensteinian squad building based on popularity too. They sign washed Buffon too during that year as their UCL GK. Eh I think Neymar was the one who was really signed to win the CL. If you start with the assumption that Neymar would miss so many games, especially in the latter stages of the CL, I don't think PSG could say Mbappe failing to win the CL makes him a disappointment. Still worth it It definitely should. But if you asked Perez would he spend another 100M for a Liga & CL he would do it every season if he can. He is not a 150m player for PSG, and he brings so much more than goals to the team Crazy to claim Dembele was never a top 10 winger. In his final season with Barca he certainly was. By that logic, clubs in Spain, Portugal, England, France and a few others should ideally liquidate like tomorrow and states should forcefully seize the money and use it elsewhere because colonialism if theres some monument honoring anyone/thing in their city connected to that era. Stupid ass argument lmao It seems like you just don't like Spaniards lol. On brand for r/soccer. Try as you might, you're not going to square this circle. Signing a good player for a reasonable price is never going to be as bad as signing a worse player for an absurd price. Only if he plays 55% of games this season. Also he will ""only"" receive 26M in the 4th year. The 32M this year are because he deferred 6M from the first year.  Still very expensive, but wanted to clarify. He's not even their highest paid player. That would be Frenkie De Jong. > Yes because they're selling off chunks of their long term assets, which will cause just as much damage. The previous deals were stupid and lead the club to where they are now but a serious club would accept the need for a few years of austerity and poor performance on the pitch to right the ship. Barcelona are not a serious club.  Mate, your club is 100% owned by Gaming International. Which as far as I can tell makes pokie machines to rob poor and old people of their money. Putting aside the size of the clubs since I don't think it's important, Barca is owned by the people, by the fans. Until Barca sell every last thing they own to Lockheed Martin or some shit I don't think you should be talking about how them selling some media rights makes them an unserious club. Lewandowski has been great so far this season? yes it's actually great business if he can stay decently healthy I'd suggest it's average business given his track record. Can easily be good or poor business, impossible to tell right now obviously but injuries have to be taken into account when there's a clear history of them Shame there is no trophy for that Infinite Warchest probably. Daddy Red Bull turns all red Numbers black. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia\_Dortmund\_team\_bus\_bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund_team_bus_bombing) Comment only someone would make that didn't watch a single buli game that year Yes it does. The exception vs the example.  Leverkusen did EVERYTHING right, at a time where Bayern has done a fuckton wrong. And it all lined up.  We were a missed pen for capitalizing that too the year before. Our 2019 window set us back years  For the oil clubs it would just be a regular day at the office what are you on about, we are affording bad signings every other season now.  In the window we signed Dembele we also bought Andre Schürle for almost the same amount.  17/18 we bought Sancho but in the same window also Yarmolenko and Philipp who were twice as expensive together.  19/20 we sign Brandt, Can and Haaland in winter break but not before splashing 51m on Nico Schulz and Thorgan Hazard.  Covid Years are quiet but once its running again, back to old patterns.  Haller (unfortunate) & Adeyemi for a combined 62m and lets be honest, we have higher expecations when we pay 30m because that's basically our transfer fee record range. Malen also doesnt play like a marquee signing.  But we're not done yet:  -Nmecha for 30m because of that one no look assist against Hertha and even though Sabi is one of our leaders now and everything worked out well in the end, the deal was virtually Guerrero+20m for him.  On top of that Guerrero was the missing piece in central mid which he proved second half of 22 season.  This year's transfer window is one of the odd ones out because it's almost perfect and nothing totally unreasonable.  [https://www.transfermarkt.de/sven-mislintat/profil/trainer/13009](https://www.transfermarkt.de/sven-mislintat/profil/trainer/13009)  Good to have him back. Look at his employment and Dortmund's transfers in the respective seasons.  The 50/50s started when he left Dortmund. The problem is Barcelona doesn’t have an oil daddy and that’s what has been fucking them over for years now. Is Hazard really considered a bad transfer? I know he ended up more of a squad player than anything else but still, you need some players like that i mean, if it's going so deep that the money lost is posing a genuine national risk then probably. Maybe they'll get sanctioned or something but idk man, at the end of the day they're fucked That's just hindsight talking. Its not that he was gonna be Suarez like for like, but he was certainly a top 3 CAM in the world at the time. Could have run the Barca midfield for a long time, had there been any reasonable plan in place for him other than just tucking him on the wings When you signed him he was scoring bangers for fun and when you factor in the fee, there was absolutely an expectation of a world class player or else why'd you pay that for him Barca certainly hoped he would roughly be that level when they paid that sum This sounds like speculation to me. I don't remember him ever saying it because of Coutinho's position being non-existent in Barca's lineup. He said that if you go to big clubs like Barca, Bayern and Madrid you're just another player but if you stay at Liverpool you'll become a legend. That never made sense since plenty of players have gone to those clubs and gotten recognized as legends. it is a bit weird tho  he won 2 league titles at Barca, then went to bayern and won a league title and CL I’m not going to delete my comment like a coward but most of it wasn’t meant to be taken seriously. FC Barcelona spending very wastefully is stupid. Barcelona residents spraying water on tourists to the city is stupid. Having a big statue of that cunt Columbus is stupid. I do feel quite strongly about that last point, but making connections between the three was only an attempt to say shit for upvotes. I’m an idiot but not enough to actually think that.  My reply to the other guy was completely sincere though, I stand by that. By far the worst of the lot, Portugal a distant second. I don’t like Spain for being rapacious colonising butchers who haven’t expressed or demonstrated any remorse for it. Got no problem with the average Spaniard, though - where did you get that idea? But it is, when you can afford 200M because you have 1B surplus but now have 1B defecit and spending 40M on player you have no need for(not accurate numbers but you get the gist). He's their only striker and started every game so far. He will easily reach that number Cheers, I wasn't sure on the exact deferral numbers. No it's not. It's owned by a consortium of wealthy fans and the supporters trust is on the verge of buying 25% of it. Actually do your research properly rather than get all pissy because someone criticised your incredibly poorly run club. 2 years left on his contract , 36 years old , 32 millions a year.   And by **his standards** he was poor last season. Even if he misses half his games it's still a much much much better deal than Dembele for 140m.  Dembele cost three times as much and was constantly injured anyway lol At least there was ambition for it Thanks I understand Bayern had been falling in points even though they had 11 years of reigning and it was only a matter of time, proven last year. Still though the trophy was already with them. Schurrle was a bad move, but I had to pick an arbitrary length to look back at - and started at 5 years, but realized it would be distortionary to cut it at 5 years given notable bad signings that happen right outside of that range (so I went with 6). But if we want to go 10 years, i dont see a bad signing every other season (though clearly we have vastly different assessments of players)  14/15: was a flop of a transfer window, with Immobile failing to settle in and Kampl not quite panning out for BVB. 30M poorly spent between the two. However, both players went on to be sold for amounts rather close to what they were bought for, which also factors in IMO.   15/16: Saw minimal spending, nothing worth writing home about.   16/17: Schurrle was a terrible transfer, no argument there. Hardly any value was recouped as well.   17/18: I have a different assessment of this window. It was not particularly good, but Philip was eventually sold for exactly what we paid for him, so not a disaster. Yarmolenko was bad as well, but also went on to be sold for 20M of the 25M we paid for him - so again, I wouldnt class it as catastrophic failure.   18/19: Nothing glaringly bad, Delaney was somewhat disappointing maybe though he ultimately featured in nearly 90 games for us so not like he was unplayable shite.   19/20: We agree though I class Schulz and Hazard as somewhat different in the degree of which they failed.   Haller was a bad signing because the dude got Cancer, not because he was a bad fit. Even when barely fit after returning from chemo, he clearly \*FIT\* the squad, he just wasnt the same player. I personally cannot count this as a failure.  Adeyemi is not a failure, regardless of whether he's not quite grown into the player her could be. Same for Malen. 30M being our arbitrary cutoff for what we're willing to spend does not mean we should have outsized expectations for a 30M signing. You can't expect them to be perfect players when we're ultimately - not paying anywhere close to what such players go for on the market.   Both Adeyemi and Malen have featured heavily as starters and contributors to the near title wins in the recent seasons. Do they have potential to be more? Yes. But neither of them are bad signings IMO. Karim is 22 lol. Malen has literally carried the team during stretches in the league.      inexcusable signings: Schurrle, Schulz  Bad signings: Hazard, Haller (with all of caveats in the world), Nmecha  I include Nmecha as a bad signing rather than inexcusable, as there is still a world where he isn't an unmitigated disaster and can play well enough to recoup even 20M of that fee. Which still sucks, but can change in the next year. They don't have one, but spend like they do   BVB doesn't have one but is realistic about the financial realities they must work within He went from being a nailed on starter and a strong performer throughout our really difficult European fixtures, to spare parts in the Dortmund squad I think it's more for the money they spent, it feels a bit bad in hindsight  He's the 12th most expensive incoming transfer in BVB history, I think in that context - the expectation was a starter & regular contributor.   Had his transfer been maybe 15-20 mil I wouldn't think much, but 25M was steep for what they got out of him I don't have deep knowledge about their finances so take this with a huge grain of salt but considering their stature and global profile they'll probably be able to service their debt if they stopped spending money for a few seasons. The 'levers' being activated means they've limited their future earnings potential immensely but that doesn't mean they're likely to go under or anything just that they'll have a hard time competing with the truly top teams financially. That's the issue. He was primarily an attacking midfielder but was shoehorned into an interior role without a coach or tactical plan necessary for such an assimilation to be successful. There's a reason why his first half-season was seen with the most positive eyes than the rest of his tenure because he played in a more wide midfield role.  He played on the wing at Liverpool previously too but his role and movement was entirely different. It was a tactical misfit of a signing based on name value and a naive assumption for him to adapt. What made everything worse was that his workrate wasn't good (so he wouldn't try hard to win the ball back etc) and then when low on confidence his output and decision-making dropped significantly. I say this as someone who loved Coutinho when he played for Liverpool and followed the leaks of his signing etc heavily.   This may seem like hyperbole but Denis Suárez was who we wanted Coutinho to be in terms of adaptation to our style IMO. He had some very similar traits and better workrate, but didn't have sunk-cost attached to him as much as Couts did.  It goes to show that aside from the rest of the stupidity involved, proper tactical planning is key. This is why Olmo could've been a misfit signing if we signed him previously where he likely would've been shoehorned into some rigid unsuited role in the previous system rather than the freedom he plays with in Flick's one. Coutinho was what Foden is now no? (Not playstyle but numbers) I don’t think he was ever a top 3 cam or world class. He was a highlight reel player that looked great in youtube compilations but he had so many flaws to his game and was so inconsistent. Maybe Klopp knew it wasn't going to work out for Coutinho. Barca at that time were still a very 4-3-3 team. It's a bit obtuse to say it doesn't make sense. It makes perfect sense. Yes, you can become a legend at another club too - but Barcelona is a club filled with legends, and the team he joined was full of them. Take Mascherano as an example of a successful transfer. Do you think, in 20 years, when talking about the Barcelona of the early to mid 2010s that anyone would mention Mascherano despite him being a legend? No chance. They'll talk about Messi, Iniesta and Xavi. But for other clubs it's obviously different. Leicester City fans will never forget Jamie Vardy, for instance. It was pretty obvious that he wouldn’t fit in at Barcelona and I’m sure Klopp saw it. Coutinho never had the positioning discipline, consistency, defensive, or pressing abilities capabilities to replace Xavi or Iniesta in midfield. He didn’t have the athleticism to replace Neymar on the wings. The only thing he could do well was play as an inside attacking midfielder, but there was no space in that team for a role like that, since that was the area Messi occupied. I specifically remember them trying to sign a winger and they chose Coutinho and Klopp coming out and being like “wtf? he isn’t a winger… he just plays on the left sometimes” or something like that Individual players can't be judged for team awards without context. Not my club mate. Sorry for the error, your club apparently changes owners and goes into liquidation so much (not a poorly run club though?) that it's hard to keep track of which rich wanker owns it. Still, incredible hubris lecturing other clubs about financial matters considering the state of your own club. That is all true. I have faith he will be good under Flick though. If he can just have 1-2 more good seasons in him we can get a replacement in 2026 hopefully. let's be honest. Barca overpaid tremendously for Dembele, but he wasn't considered injury prone before transfer, and people saw Mbappe levels of talent in him at the time.  Speaking with benefit of hindsight on Dembele is pretty funny, considering Olmo could get hit by a car tomorrow and never play again. Poof he's suddenly worst transfer ever considering that! We have plenty of that in the league, Dortmund not so much. I didn't pick an arbitrary length, i linked those transfer windows to a designated position responsible for those.  The difference in assessment of players becomes obvious in contrast to other players we signed and the expecations the club vocalizes itself.  What we can't really afford is signing young hopefuls who remain young hopefuls for an extended period of time.  I agree with Haller's situation being unfortunate but this is one of those cases where football becomes second nature so it is what it is. The rest i stand by.     Agree to disagree I obviously take personal credit for Adeyemis performance tonight. Never doubted him one second etc etc Relax bro, dont forget where you come from haha he was very good in his first season, then slowly became spare parts that sounds reasonable, but them going under would be so much funnier Oh no they sold off 5% of their revenue whatever shall they do. It always gives me a laugh how misconstrued this whole situation has been by the average redditor. He was young and off the back of 2 individually quite stellar seasons at Liverpool.. Yeah he may have had some flaws but he was undoubtedly a better player than whatever he showed at Barca..   He didn't stand a chance in the weird 442 setup they had when he arrived. Not to mention, they tried for a long time to turn him into Neymar, playing on the left wing He absolutely was world class by the time he left us. He had consistency issues until Klopp, but that final 18 months he was phenomenal and easily world class. People forget that before our front three got all the praise in his final season, it was ""The Fab Four"".       His final 18 months: 57 played, 26 goals, 17 assists. I don't expect a Leicester city or a Sheffield Utd fan to remember that Mascherano played for the club. Obviously when they think about Barca they mainly think about the players you mentioned and not Mascherano.   However to Barca fans he'll always be an important and unforgettable player for us. Same with players like Paulinho, Luuk de Jong and Aubameyang. Neither of those three are club legends but Barca fans are not forgetting them anytime soon. Of course if you were to ask a Watford fan then yeah he won't remember those players playing for Barca. >Leicester City fans will never forget Jamie Vardy, for instance.  Lol this is absolutely wild to think of Leicester City as an example here.  You know that Liverpool is one of the biggest club in the world right? Administration not liquidation. You keep making mistakes. Is there anything in that comment that suggests I'm not relaxed lmfao? Yeah shame they can't have a billion owner like every other club...you guys are clearly the moral high point. They sold off revenue streams and will have to compete with clubs who are in compete control of their finances. If the whole situation was misconstrued Barca would be in a great financial position and not struggling badly. His best performances were in that 2nd half of the season when he arrived under Valverde in that formation. He was garbage after that I never got the hype, personally. I don't think I've ever been more frustrated by anyone as much as Coutinho watching Liverpool. 26 goals looks impressive if you forget that he took about 10 long range shots in every game and spooned most of them over the bar.  He killed a lot of our attacks by needlessly shooting from anywhere when simple passes were on. Hyperbole is a frequent rhetorical tool used to underline a point. Klopps point is even clearer if you use Leicester as an example.  You also gotta remember the position Liverpool was in when Coutinho left. Coutinho could've easily had a higher status than Salah has today, if he didn't leave. Well run club... lol wtf are you talkin about lol Right like the rest of their whole league that took a worse deal from CVC. Just admit you know fuck all about the situation. I mostly agree with your general point but I don't think there's any way Coutinho would have had a higher status than Salah does today. There's no world where he has the type of seasons Salah went on to have. >Hyperbole is a frequent rhetorical tool used to underline a point.  That wasn't a hyperbole, just a dumb and frankly insulting example lol.   An hyperbole is something like ""I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse."" See the difference? Conflating two separate things to make yourself sound informed is funny. He obviously wouldn’t score as much, but he was brilliant his last full season with Liverpool (16/17). Remember that he came to Liverpool in 2012. At one of the lowest points Liverpool has had for many decades. Had he stayed, and kept his level, he would’ve been a club icon just like Salah. Didn't Barca win a title in 2023? They're struggling badly? Damn if that's struggling badly I'm not sure what you'd call the situation at United lol You clearly have no clue what you're talking about and just talking shit on here for the sake of it. On field performances =/= Club's financial condition. And bringing up United is just stupid because United is the perfect illustration of this. No one, not Barca fans and most importantly their sporting directors who have access to their finacials unlike you thinks their finances are in good shape. Bringing up irrelevant shit like the CWC and United won't change that fact nor will it make your opinion any more valud lol. The fact you think I'm talking about the club world cup and not the league wide deal with CVC is fucking hilarious. Not wasting my time explaining to a clueless idiot.  Barcas finances are nowhere bad as you think they are. It's only la ligas strict rules that hamstring them and they aren't the only club that gets shafted by the league in that sense. But once again you'd have to have a clue to understand any of it so I'm not surprised it's lost on you. > The fact you think I'm talking about the club world cup and not the league wide deal with CVC is fucking hilarious. Not wasting my time explaining to a clueless idiot.  Of course you will say this because I didn't grasp the correct abbreviation of an irrelevant point you were inserting into a discussion about Barcelona finances. Like, even if I accepted your assertion that the rest of La Liga settled for a less than ideal TV deal... that is relevant to Barca's poor financial condition forcing them to sell their revenue streams... how exactly? You didn't even put forth an actual argument connecting the two. It's the kind of argumentation style you see in YouTube comments.  >Barcas finances are nowhere bad as you think they are. It's only la ligas strict rules that hamstring them and they aren't the only club that gets shafted by the league in that sense. But once again you'd have to have a clue to understand any of it so I'm not surprised it's lost on you.  Barca's financial condition is quite bad and they're also hamstrung by La Liga's strict financial fair play rules. You talk in absolutes like you've looked at their confidential financial statements..."

Chelsea have spunked so much fucking money. Who did Barca buy in 19/20 besides De Jong and Griezmann? I so expected man utd to be there Real madrid being 9th when doing it in 2009/2010 is kinda insane What's really crazy is that if you factor in inflation, Chelsea’s windows in 2005 and 2006 under Mourinho, they would be numbers 2 and 3 on this list. So depressing Al-Hilal spending $350.000.000 to earn $1.000.000 prize from Saudi League championship.  Does anyone in the world even watch the league other than an occasional highlight when Ronaldo scores? Nothing selling a car park or 2 to yourself can’t fix. Not a fan of using absolute numbers for this to be quite honest - revenues keep rising significantly year over year, after all, so it's probably smarter to look at it as the percentage of revenue spent by a club.  Real Madrid's revenue for the 2009/10 season was about €440m, while in 22/23 it was about €830m. Their Summer window in 09/10 was thus *significantly* more expensive than their 19/20 summer window, despite being a lower total sum of money.  And that's completely ignoring the outgoings, either: Much easier to spend mad money when you actually sell players for equally mad money. Chelsea also spent €174m in 03/04 (equivalent of €366m today) and then followed it up with a €162m window in 04/05. I’ll never forget how half my school dropped Ipswich to start supporting Chelsea around these years. 19/20,. Hazard, jovic, miltao, mendy.   Either incredibly good or incredibly shite That city 17/18 summer window is an all time great summer   Apart from mendy who tore His acl/ Achilles all were hits The damn red cartel strikes again !! PSG 2017 summer? Mbappe and Neymar 180M and 222M? Spending €330 in the winter transfer market is next level Padme: And Chelsea won the league after that right? Transfer the window must be the most exciting time for Chelsea fans. The club takes transfer windows wayy more seriously than the season. I would love something like this adjusted to inflation too :) Chelsea are playing real life career mode Chelsea at over a billion spent inside of two years.      Lmao. Madness It's always been strange to me how much more hate City receives compared to Chelsea. And to be clear, that's not me defending City. They deserve it all.   Chelsea deserve much more hate. I don't think any club helped normalize this modern trend of sportswashing and blood money more than them. Chelsea don’t get enough hate for this. I mean, we all fucking hate them. But they don’t don’t get enough hate. Spent a billion on potential. That same billion could've gone to world class proven stars. Chelsea are reckless. And that’s before inflation. Chelsea’s spend in 04 or something was closer to 500m with inflation Wait, I thought everyone said we were the biggest spenders? 330 m in a winter window.... bw two other massive windows. Chelsea are idiots (no offence) Not surprised to see Chelsea there. If you made a similar list 15 years ago they would've topped the list as well. Are people just finding out about transfermarkt? Why is there a sudden rise in posts from transfermarkt? I remember THAT Real Madrid summer window. Will never ser something like that again i think. How have Chelsea not accumulated 1150 charges at this point??? How do one spend 330m in winter window 300 million in Winter and still being ass is funny You’d think United would be in there for sure, 330m in winter window is crazy 🤣 PSG and Chelsea under Clearlake spent this much and almost no trophy to show for it. Aston Villa might actually get into this list, they'd spent something like €179M before selling Diaby (€60M), Duran (€45M) and potentially Ramsey for €30M. They're absolutely going into the market for more attackers.  Activate Goncalves release clause and Villa would be 8th on the list.  I think maybe only loans and free transfers are left for us though. By Real Madrid standards…the 19/20 transfer window was bad because of 2 duds (Hazard and Jovic) who cost 200 million and left for nothing But lets give everton penalty points 🤦‍♂️ That Madrid window with inflation would be one of the top 3 I hate city but I hate Chelsea more. It's just what humans should do I'm a certified Chelsea hater. Fuck this club fr would rather see my local rivale team win a trophy than them. Again, fuck you.. Respectfully Who did real madrid sign in that window Where citeh? Only Winter window there 💪   And the summer is included in the graphic too. And we only finished 12th... Didn’t psg get Neymar and Mbappe same summer Poor Chelsea lol Lol juve literally made the list by buying cr7 😂 that was half of their spend I might be a bit biased, but Madrid 09/10 is surely the best. Bought two of our top scorers, a ballon d'or winner (didn't work out that well but still), and a legendary midfielder along with some good squad players. 🥳🔵🔵🔵🥳 19/20 season transfers were overall a disappointment and saved by some key players that arrived and a decent amount of sales. Earned 130m from sales, but paid for Reinier 30, Jović 60, and Hazard 115. Won the league that year nevertheless and the positive transfers (Mendy, Militão, Rodrygo) have been crucial to the trophies that followed Sigh, we are crazy It's amazing how few actually really good players Chelsea got for that. Maybe in five years we'll be singing a different tune but I can't think of a single top class signing. The midfield two could be really good in time, Enzo and Caicedo, but nothing revolutionary. Buy some pound shop players and go all in, a little FOX trot play a few long balls then BOOM prem winners .      We LCFC, come get us 265M is absurd, we could've had the best midfield in the world with that money Hey guys, I'm new to football. Wow, this Chelsea team must be really good! I bet they win the league every time. No way puny Manchester City can put up a fight against them. They've got a load of expensive players but they don't have a team and that's why a succession of managers have failed. What sort of pound notes does Chelsea get for a 4 / 5th spot in the prem and what average pound notes do they get for sponsorship ,ticket sales and so on in say a season ,don’t  that cover the shite they spend Chelsea buys literally everything, I bet they’re the ones who bought all the marmite this morning POV: Why Champions League will forever be joke because it's literally all about money and UEFA doesn't give a shit about anything else. As a United fan im a bit surprised not to see us on here. Now do net spend. Some nonsense math, because why not:  22/23 Chelsea ended with 44 points in the PL. With a little investment of 464M euros, they SKYROCKETED to 63 in 23/24. That's almost 24,5M euros per point. So now, considering you need 93 points to win the PL, they only need to spend around 735M in this window to have a chance to fight for the title. Summer and Winter 22/23? Cheslea wtf lmao A lot less Madrid than I figured, I guess spending really kicked into overdrive recently Good job Chelsea, good job. You’re number 1! Spent*  Usually I wouldn't care to point it out, but it's literally in the infographic. Disgusting The summer of 2019, had 2 huge busts. Could explain why we try to sign more free agents now. Mendy and Militao worked out though In my mind the summer where Madrid brought in Alonso, Kaka, Benzema, Ronaldo & others is always burned into my head as a huge splurge but it's probably barely in the Top 20 now. Why don’t they just say the year of the actual transfer window. There was no 23/24 summer. It was 23… One day they will ban Chelsea. One day. Chelsea under Boehly is so bad It's funny isn't it that when you're owner and entire team are forced to leave, and you have to do a full rebuild to simply compete in the same league, let alone make top half of the table, and people have a whinge when they've spent so much money jesus christ, chelsea I always thought Zidane or Figo transfer window would be most spent in a season ever. Of course adjusted to inflation.  Figo was 60 million in 00. That's 24 years ago. Yet people complain about City and their spending Chelsea.. no vision, just $$$. All I see in media is ppl complaining Man Utd spending a lot. We aint even in all time top 10 lmao. Suppose Chelsea finishes outside the Top 4 this season. That would be an incredible achievement for the new owners. Let's be honest there are more chances of Aston Villa, Toon, and Pool finishing in the Top 4 than Chelsea this year. For all that money PSG still plays France terrorball. *spent Always find these stats meaningless if not adjusted for inflation. It's not the size of the spend that matters, it's how you use it. Chelsea are a clown show under Boehly. This is worthless without inflation but yeah clearlake are clowns Are Chelsea just a tax write off for these billionaires? That's exactly the reason why I believe all Chelsea fans are plastic fans. Having a winter transfer window 5th all time is incredible. Even more incredible is the fact that season ended with them in 12th Do u guys think Chelsea has a big future with these young lads. I'm not a Chelsea fan so I probably don't know. Bt we know American's don't invest on something that has no return profit. Either the best way for the club success or seeing it as a cash cow club. In terms of business Glazers is a role model. Bt what with this Boely? They are running like Fifa manager career mode, finding future gems, only raw & young talents except paying release clauses and hard-core money... [deleted] BlueCo are bozos, nothing new Man City only once in this and at the bottom. American Money is ruining football. Proud of my team Shouldn’t psg be there in the top 10 twice?  I’m sure they spent €222M on just Neymar’s transfer fee alone in 2017, not to include other transfers Spending in the 2020's would've been much higher if covid didn't hit. God I hate Chelsea Still they’ll hate on City Todd Boely and Egbali Masterclass And yet, people only shit on Man City for spending a lot. But but but man city are ruining football uhhhhhh well , Neymar did not won any ballon'dor or UCL after he joıned PSG but he left a huge mark to football history probably bigger than Ronaldo and Messi. Are these adjusted for inflation or flat dollar amount at the time? If the values were normalized to average transfer values for that year, Chelsea and Real would probably be on the list more. All that money Chelsea have spent and nothing to show for it. Joke club Where’s Arsenal😭can someone from Saudi just buy our shit club already Where’s Arsenal? Where’s Arsenal? Yeah that’s easily the #1 most expensive window considering the time period Single most crazy transfer window for a club  Ronaldo + Benzema + Kaka + Xabi Alonso + 3/4 bench players Seeing Real Madrid 09/10 on this list is like seeing Titanic (1997) on the highest grossing movies of all time list. It sticks out like a sore thumb how something from an entirely different era still holds up against current contenders. its honestly crazy to see it so far down the list, that summer was historic. even the fans were stunned, we were expecting ronaldo but getting kaka benzema and xabi as well felt like a dream It was worth it.  It brought us our #1 & #2 All Time Goal-scorers & our #1 and #2 All Time Assisters in Club history. The early Chelsea windows after the takeover were even worse. The money they spent and the wages they paid pales in comparison to anything ive seen since, not counting saudi league. Disgusting really  With normal inflation it's €400M  Add Neymar inflation and easy to argue its comparable to €600M spend today It's so ridiculous, they literally show up twice in same year and then the year after  What the fuck A billion € in a year... And now they're having to do creative accounting to pass FFP  Time bomb waiting to blow Chelsea is just the designer version of us They've spent over a billion pounds in the last two years, just on signing new players.  It's genuinely hard to even wrap your mind around it. And for what? Two of our most disappointing seasons since the late 80s/early 90s.   This upcoming season should be make or break for the big brain sporting directors. No CL and we’re in trouble. There’s no more car parks or hotels to sell. They also tend to sell players well. Instead of going on their spending spree, Chelsea could have used that money to make over 200,000 fresh water wells for villages in Africa, supplying 40-50 million people with a reliable, nearby source of clean, uncontaminated drinking water for 20 years. One Wesley Fofana costs as much as several thousand wells for a couple million people.  There’s so much fucking money in this sport, and for what? So a billionaire’s play thing can finish mid-table?  Edit: lmao people taking this so seriously. It’s just a hypothetical to give perspective on how much €1 billion is when it’s not spent on football players but on shit in the real world that affects people in a good way.  Maybe it’s time to delete reddit. Ikr could never be my association football club They paid 75 mil to replace Pulisic with Mudryk lmao ...  They paid the price of an elite player money to downgrade to a much worse player Cheaters. SO CRAZY Which is why seeing them in 10th was so satisfying. That’s 1b in 2023 But they sell well. Neto, Pedri and Firpo Neto 26m, Pedri 23m, Firpo 20m, Braithwaite for 18m, Matheus Fernandes 7m and Cucurella 4m We’re always 1st or 2nd on net spend because we barely get any money from selling players. Total expenditure though we’re below City and Chelsea. They don't normally spend more than £200m in a window, do they?  I swear it's normally somewhere between £100m and £200m, depending on what they spent in the previous window. We always show up under the ""Spent X in Y years"" because we consistently spend decent amounts in subsequent windows. In reality however, we hardly ever spend that much in individual windows [deleted] Adjusted for football inflation, that one is definitely up there. Huge window. It's probably the greatest transfer window by any  club seeing they got Cristiano, Benzema top 1/2 scorer and assister in their history along with Kaka who had won the ballon d'or the year before, xabi Alonso who was incredible for them and easily one of the best DMs out there, albiol was kind of underwhelming but came around in later seasons and some bench players.   Obviously a ridiculous amount of money but probably the most well worth transfer window any club could have seeing the amount listed here. The market was SO MUCH cheaper back then I feel like Chelsea lucked out by investing so much at the cusp of the PL starting to become the main league, that they managed to avoid the stigma that Man City has by growing a fan base early on, if that makes sense I've always wondered how much our guys that we bought in the early 2000s would go for now. Rio, Wayne and Keane in the 90s 03/04 would be pretty crazy as well. Parker,bridge, Cole and Johnson all for around 10/15 mil all good young prospects in the premier league so you’re doubling/tripling all of those.  Crespo was 28 and had injury worries but today would be significantly more than 26mil.  Makelele was 30 but undoubtedly the best player at his role in world football. Closest recent comparison I can think is Casemiro which was 60ml.  Duff again is in the premier league and one of the best wingers in the league so I can’t see that being less than 50 mil today  And still have mutu, veron, geremi and smertin   That would have to be at least 350 mil in todays market Inflation is one thing but it's even crazier when you factor in how much the teams they were competing with generally spent in those days and scaled it to today's league.  When Roman first took over Chelsea spent as much as the entire top 10 in the league combined in the first summer. And spent a similar amount comparatively in the next summer. If we scaled that to the modern game it would be the equivalent of spending over a billion in a transfer window Does this add inflation to the other numbers too? Those windows worked though unlike clearlake's Not really though - if you factor in inflation for Chelsea you'd have to do it for other clubs too which means some of our spending seasons for example would be higher on that list. And I imagine many of the Italian clubs too. Gotta be some kind of reverse alchemy to spend over €1b on a Champions League winning squad and somehow end up with a worse team 🤦🏻‍♂️ They’ve even managed to make the transfer window an unenjoyable period as a fan lol and if you have any qualms our sub just berates you for not wanting “the best for the club” I remember being so excited after the 2023 transfer window and pre-season.   However, reality squashed that delusion fairly quickly. Boo hoo your club is only relevant due to outspending the rest of us How about that Enzo case then eh? Might not shock you to know that Saudi Arabia isn’t in sportswashing for the money i’d imagine middle easterners and arabs do, but even so, european football is very popular in that region Google ""soft power"" At first I watched some highlights because of Ronaldo, but the level of football there is so low that whatever he scored  was so meaningless, and many of his goals looked so ridiculously easy, so I stopped watching altogether.      I think Saudis invest all that money because they think it improves their chances to host the world cup I guess?  Don't know why it is so important for them.     But honestly it's just ridiculous to spend so much money on washed up players, instead of trying to invest it in something beneficial to humanity. Like maybe instead build some roads and some schools and try to feed some people.   To compete with 3 other teams with the same ownership, and 14 other teams with affiliated ownership. Pretty clear that the purpose of the project isn’t the competition. The real prize is the sponsorships for most clubs, not the national league organization's prize Good, the less money those Arab slave owners have the better Idk about that but al hilal ronaldo kit is everywhere i bet the sponsor paid a shit ton of money. It's all sports washing baby. It's allowed under IFRS Standard due to how much owner the equity has in the business. Anything less than. 10% it straight investment in the business, no influence in decision-making, its non arms length transaction. Anything over 10% now we are getting into complicated Accounting standards IFRS. But then you wouldn't get any of these teams here, unless you put a constraint of having at least spend 100M. Very small teams will dominate the list, or teams with some shady tactics. Few that come to my mind are Nottingham Forrest spending almost 200mil like 2 years ago, to make sure they wouldn't relegate.   Or even Belgian team Molenbeek. Who spend 28 mil last summer on Nuamah, but their revenue is probably not even close to that, since they are a 2nd tier club (at the time 1 tier). It was mostly some financial magic for Olympique Lyon.   But cases like that would dominate the list if you would do transfer spendings compared to revenue. Yeah those years cemented them as the 4th most supported English team outside of the UK. The “traditional big 3” were United, Liverpool &amp; Arsenal, but Mourinho’s first term spiked their popularity amongst people who didn’t really like any of the Big 3. And Rodrygo.  The cheapest 3 turned out to be the most impactful. Rodrygo and Reinier also Sometimes maybe good. Sometimes maybe shit. It really was. A testament to that is the fact nearly all those players are still there. And city has yet to reach that number again while maintaining dominance Yeah it was Mendy's injury history that was what really brought him down.... Mbappe was bought next season. It was a loan that season. Mbappe was a loan with obligation to buy, Neymar was paid by Qatar as a Sports Ambassador and paid his own release clause fee iirc, didn't he move there for ''free'' as far as FFP is concerned? It's hard to do that because football inflation and actual inflation are not the same. So like a 20m signing 20 years ago might have been sorta like a 200m signing based on football transfer inflation, but it's not like 200m in actual money. Since they don't align, it's kinda pointless really to compare like that. Like, a team spending 20m wasn't actually like them spending 200m now. It was like them spending like probably 25-30m in capital. But then a player going for that at the time was crazy. But the sport still made regular old money, not made up football inflation money. training agi chatGPT 4/5 cost less than assembling chelsea's abysmal 11 people hated chelsea way way more early on, then they just kind of became part of the furniture 6 league titles in 7 years is the reason. Hate back in 2012 wasn’t even close to this. I think (currently at least) it's largely down to the relative success levels. Since City are having far more success, then they also get significantly more hate, as rival fans feel the need to explain their own teams' shortcomings, but also because it gets tedious if one team wins all the time (kinda like Verstappen in F1 currently).  On the other hand, if Chelsea were currently dominating, then for sure they should get a lot more flak for the past couple of seasons' spending, because by any measurement, that's been insane. However, currently in these parts they get more of a free pass (in comparison to City - and even PSG - at least). It's because City has been very successful while Chelsea have become a joke (injuries + manager changes every full moon). When Chelsea starts dominating again, there'll be more haters. We get hate all the time. How often do you actually see positive comments about Chelsea? Every time a hotel or a car park gets sold, or we buy another player, we get an influx of hate comments.  City get more attention because they're at the top now. In 5 years, if we switch positions and City are inconsistent but we win the title, we'll attract the attention. Doesn't mean City won't be getting hate too, just means the spotlight would be on us.  I get why people hate, and I don't. Roman took us over before FFP. Takeovers happened all the time. We just happened to have an owner that spent more than others. Without clubs like City and Chelsea taking over, the Premier League would be just like Laliga with Real, Barca and Athletico. Removing my Chelsea bias, I like the fact that there are more big clubs than before. Yes City have dominated in the relative short term. But on a grander scale, United, Arsenal, Liverpool etc may dominate once Pep leaves. At least now there are more than those 3 clubs. Makes the league a bit more exciting having more good teams.  It's the reason I like the fact that Newcastle may challenge in future years. A historic club who's fans may actually get to see success for the first time in their lives.  Even as a Chelsea fan, I hate where the money comes from. Chelsea, City, Newcastle etc. But I like the competition it's brought to English football relative to other European countries. I'd find it so boring if the same 2 or 3 clubs dominated for 20 or 30 years. At least in England, someone else could take the mantle from United or City in 5 years. It isn't gonna be those two forever and always.  That's why the thing I hated wasn't the takeovers, it was FFP. It shut the door behind the big clubs. Made it a big 6 and big 6 only so other clubs couldn't keep up. Obviously it was intended to protect clubs (mainly smaller ones) from bad owners. But a big side effect was creating a gap between the big 6 and other 14. I honestly don't have a problem with owners investing in their clubs, but I'd like smaller clubs to at least have the option of joining the current big ones. Now it just feels like we have spending rules that are dependent on revenue which was established at a fixed point in time. Meaning the clubs that were big when FFP was introduced will always have an advantage over the others. I don't see that as fair. One of those things where the active witnesses to Chelsea's rise are tired of complaining about it and they're not good enough to where they're credible enough to care about as a benefactor of wealth. theyve been around too long and they impressed themselves into the top 4 before it was a top 6, there quickly becomes not much an Arsenal supporter can complain about  Chelsea having money when there's a world of football underneath 4th place that could only dream of being in a position of such envy. Oh I certainly hate chelsea, they definitely ruined football I think it's because they existed for more than 15 years They don’t win to be hated. All that scouting and billion dollar spending and their best player is a city academy youngster... yikes Ooo please don't hate us It's more like you're one of the worse spenders. You're selling is sometimes just depressing. if you made it 15 years ago the team on this list from 2009 would top the list no? Because they don't pay under the table. Good old fashion selling hotels to themselves Enzo, Mudryk, Badiashile, Madueke, Gusto, Santos, Fofana is how We are consistent. Probably the next 11 windows in that list. Explain how the full rebuild was necessary because the owner was forced to sell. No players were forced to leave because the owner had to sell.   Also, that wasn't exactly Chelseas first shopping spree No one knows. We could dominate the next 15 years, or become something like Tottenham, Europe regulars but not challengers. Reality will probably be somewhere in the middle. 2 or 3 out of the top10 is 'American money'. But sure, there are ruining it lmao Mbappe was a loan that season Because somehow city won the luck of the draw twice with aguero and halland No, they're just the more recent plastic club.  Everyone hated Chelsea between 2004 and 2012 when they were seriously successful.  Now they're just a farce and City has become the real 'artifical' threat. The financial accuracy is incorrect hence why yall are charged for 115 charges. Adjust Citys early spending spree after Mansour took over the club for inflation and see how this list looks then.   Besides, City can be a blight on football even if Chelsea is also one He did not win Ballon d'Or before joined PSG as well so how did he make a mark bigger than those two? It's not a dollar amount at all. Zidane in 00 was bought by a figure that was half their revenue that year. That's like them spending 550M on Mpappe now Alonso, Arbeloa, Benzema, Ronaldo, Garay, Granero, Kaka, Albiol.  Tbf, that's a pretty spectacular transfer window. Early Abramovic windows at Chelsea would be up there when accounting for time. Insane numbers. Adjust for player inflations today and it should be by far and away at the top. They brought in Benzema, Cr7, Kaka, Xabi.   Young CR7 easily 200-250+ in today’s market. We won't see anything like it ever again, that would cost over half a billion in today's market. Considering how all the others are post Neymar inflation, it's not so surprising imo. The galacticos 2.0 but this time they actually won shit, now papa flo is obsessed with Brazilian children lol. I think i will never feel that way again as i did that summer. Wished Kaka panned out, but Xabi, Arbeola, Albiol were good (later one) to great servants as players. I wouldn't say it was bad. However since it was a huge success, people rarely talk about it like Chelsea or man city. That is so stupid to think about haha. Chelsea fans might not like to hear this, but they're nowhere near successful enough of a team compared to how much money they've spent over the last 2 decades. They've spent the MOST in world football by QUITE a margin during their most successful period and yet they fall decently short of many clubs while those were in their glory years.  Even City have overtaken them for major trophies now, a club over which they had a headstart of about 4 years. Chelsea is everything that’s wrong with modern football. why couldn’t klopp have such ridiculous backing? i wonder what he could’ve done Hilarious, really. Does it count sold, as well, this number? And because of it, Fernando Torres has been lost to history as one of the worst signings in modern footballing history. Mans can analyze an infographic ! Three consecutive transfer windows in the top 5 of all of Europe and the results show how wasteful it can be to throw around that much money at once.  A club needs to spend money on players that will fit their needs but when you overhaul the squad completely, you have no idea what you need and what a new player needs to fit into. They've spent close to $1.5bn in a year on transfers alone.  A new world class stadium in London will cost slightly more than that. Chelsea fans, is the stadium still happening even after so much money being wasted by Blueco? don’t worry, Everton will get another bunch of points deducted, AS Roma will get a transfer ban, and Inter will be sold another 57x before Chelsea is even brought up in a FFP meeting room It's funny isn't it then when you're owner and entire team are forced to leave, and you have to do a full rebuild to simply compete in the same league, let alone make top half of the table, and people have a whinge when they've spent so much money Not really. The new PSR rules basically wiped out our spending from those seasons. They’ll just do some bullshit like selling another hotel to themselves. They’re cheats to the core and I doubt they’ll ever face any real consequences They should be sacked if we don't get CL let's see how the season pans out. Literally big brains, think they know it all. Next level horrific asset management  Like paying 75 mil to swap replace Pulisic with Mudryk ...  100 mil for Mudryk has to be one of most absurd, non sensical moves ever.  It didnt make any sense at the time either. Those transfers last season only less than a handful have had any impact I feel like people have been saying that for the past 2 years yet you find more assets and more loopholes... i'll believe it when i see it And hotels! This doesn’t make a lot of sense. That money isn’t gone, it went to other clubs. >So a billionaire’s play thing can finish mid-table?    Lol would it have been any more meaningful compared to the things you mentioned if we had finished top 4? You could say the same about any of these teams because to paraphrase Ancelotti, football just isn't that important in the grand scheme of things. What an insane comment Big r/im14andthisisdeep vibes are you 12 years old? Please take a break from the internet good lord LMAOO well done Jimmy, now go show this to your mom and you'll get a cookie. Football is a business at the end of the day that creates thousands of jobs per club and entertains millions, get over yourself.  If you want to go and cry about something at least cry about something that pisses away money and doesn't impact anything in a positive way. You think an investment firm that thought spending 4 billion on buying any football club is a good idea cares about wells in Africa ? least insane bvb fan Nah. I didn’t need that to enjoy watching them fail. Thanks. I know. Selling two hotels to themselves for basically pure profit to balance the books is a great way to handle business. Neto was for cooking the books, Matheus transfer was super shady I always thought Pedri was La Masia, not sure why What happened to Firpo? Cucurella? He was already at Barca. He was on loan to Getafe that season. Braithwaite was in the winter tho so that doesnt count towards this figure Idek what Matheus Fernandes looks like to this day Buy high sell low. Buy, give big money, player regresses, release on a free. Weve only ever broken 200 million pounds in a summer once and that was ten hags first season  Euros i think weve done it 3 times 2 being under ten hag >We also very rarely spend in winter.  How is that related, given that it is a list of money spent in a single transfer window(Summer or Winter) Chelsea manages to do both! Definitely a masterclass in how to spend big money Madrid really stumped kaka's career man, but that transfer window was legendary asf Not just the cusp of the PL becoming huge, but also before everyone was terminally online. We had that stigma. We were always called the money or oil club after the Roman takeover. And everyone hated us just as much (if not more) than they hate City now. People just have short memories.  Judging by how attitudes to us shifted over time, in 10 years, the hate for City will have died down and they'll be seen as ""established"" because a generation of kids will have grown up having watched them. You sure about that? One of our nicknames is Chelski. I don’t believe people have forgotten, it’s just that Chelsea are shit now so it’s more funny than annoying. They didnt avoid the stigma. Everyone knew they were/are a plastic club. Its just time goes on and the newer fans dont see it that way. In 10 years, newer fans will forget city is an oil club Also the fact that City take the oil club label takes the heat off Chelsea 03/04 and 04/05 would be at the top with a huge distance to 3rd. They spent as much as the rest of the league combined during those seasons.   For comparison, the total spending of all PL clubs in 2022 was 3 billion. So those seasons would be today's equivalent of them spending ~2,5 billion per season I don't know if Makelele's price inflates that much. There's a lot of 20/20 hindsight about how valuable he was then. Real Madrid considered him expendable in their Galacticos project. If his price were to increase, it would only be because the price of the stars they were pursuing increased and they needed to raise more from sales to fund their purchases.     The role he played just wasn't valued then, and if you're revising fees based on present knowledge, you may as well just say that Barcelona, Man United and Real Madrid should be on top because Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are the two greatest players of all time and should have cost €1b when each of those teams bought them. Age, injuries and contracts expired The way they themselves constantly mention the sportswashing as their strategy kind of tells me that it's not just that, which makes them go on a moneyspree. These billionaires simply enjoy treating the world's biggest sport as their own little plaything. The sportswashing part just makes them seem more competent and business savvy rather than just outright childish. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/21/mohammed-bin-salman-says-he-will-continue-doing-sport-washing-for-saudi-arabia  From the devil’s mouth Sure they're in it for the money, they're in it because they have too much of it. The main reason for ‘sportswashing’ is to make the country seem like an attractive, popular place for (primarily Western) tourists. People say ‘well if Ronaldo and FIFA and Neymar go and play there, surely there must be something attractive to being there?’. What goes hand in hand with making it more attractive is to effectively make people forget about the disgusting and repressive human rights that those countries have. Lol, you know sports and entertainment contribute only  1-5 % of any Countries GDP. > But then you wouldn't get any of these teams here, unless you put a constraint of having at least spend 100M.  Could at least throw in the proportion of revenue as a third column, even if you're sorting by absolute monetary value - that way at least you're getting some reasonable historical context. Yep , I remember the reception some of those moves garnered at the time , ppl were uncertain about paying that much for a keeper like ederson and spending 130 ms on fullbacks Obviously you have the legal issues and his poor performances but when you sign a player and they immediately suffer a major injury i find it hard to grade that transfer Yes.... It was...  His criminal proceedings wasn't until he was crocked and coasting on the legal laurels of his contract. He was unfairly good too before he became injured, and was perfect for the deep attacking third possession City played. it just didn't last very long because he was injured I think in the first half of his first season. Thx, I didn't know this The 23/24 numbers can't be right then because Gonçalo Ramos' buy option was activated in the winter. > Neymar was paid by Qatar as a Sports Ambassador and paid his own release clause fee iirc, didn't he move there for ''free'' as far as FFP is concerned?  Nope. Neymar was paid by PSG (not Qatar) because LaLiga refused to accept the payment from PSG, saying release clauses are only valid for spanish clubs.   We know that this is the case, because the finance minister was investigated because of that incident. Because PSG had to give Neymar the money to buy himself out of his contract, it technically counted as a ""salary payment"" and would've been taxed way more. But since it really wasn't a salary payment, he waived this tax as the real salary payments Neymar got ended up being 24M in taxes per year   TLDR: Neymar's transfer is in the psg books as far as ffp was concerned It has to be as a percentage of revenues and/or total value of all transfers. I saw an excel chart like that, and it has the Zidane transfer as still the most expensive transfer in history. “Small” transfers like Henry are up there too. I think if chelsea actually did something with all that money in terms of consistent success everyone would be louder about disliking them. But in reality they are overpaying for players like crazy, leaving them with a super expensive windows but a mediocre squad that they struggle to do well with.  They havent done anything in the last three years so everyone is kinda whatever about them. The tone will change quickly if they start winning. There’s also a difference between a state run club and Chelsea even if you don’t like Chelsea.      Plus, Chelsea bends the rules, in the open and people get upset about that but it’s still within the rules. Then you have City who break the rules and act like they’re the victims. People even hated United when they were dominating. Chelsea will be hated when they start winning. City is actually older than Chelsea by several years. City has won far more than Chelsea before they had money Spurs were a bigger club than Chelsea in 2002 100% the ones that left did so because they all felt the future of the club was in jeopardy. Jumping off a sinking ship. Most of you people would have done the exact same thing if you heard your job was in danger and you may not be getting paid What a big ownership shift.. I love that unpredictability of Chelsea under Roman. But 3 consecutive off-season without a trophy is kinda scary. Lmao chelsea is literally sitting at the top and appearing 3 times among top 6 spenders and dudes here saying ""2/3 out of 10"" Sure!  American Money is ruining football and that's a fact. Period! Ahhh my bad Man City was a much more attractive club by the time Haaland was looking for his next move. That isn't luck. Aguero can be attributed to luck.   But both transfers are mostly to do with timing.  Man City got mugged off by spurs and could not land Kane. Instead of settling for less, pep just dived headfirst into the season without a proper 20+ goals a season striker.  This + Benzema being too good for Madrid , Barca being broke and Haaland prefering PL over Bundesliga played into City's hands.   So a bit of luck + alot of resilience and alot of money. So change the graphic completely to fit your narrative ok economical wise. He's third biggest brand after these two but no one on earth could buy Ronaldo or Messi in their primes. It was impossible unless they want to.  Neymar was one of them too. He wanted to leave , They paid for him humongous amount of 222 million euros and football changed forever. Fair. My American came out. Half of Madrids revenue wold be 415M€, but yeah that was insane. It was only possible by selling the old training ground in the middle of Madrid which now has multiple sky scrapers on it. Probably the greatest in history But that spending actually delivered value. It closed the gap to Manchester United, who had a domestic stranglehold at the time. Chelsea went from a cup team who occasionally qualified for the Champions League to the best team in the country and a perennial contender in Europe.     I'm not quite as pessimistic as most people about the current Clearlake strategy, though I do think that spending that much at once foolishly restricts our future flexibility, but even if the strategy works perfectly I don't think the current competitive landscape has room at the too for Chelsea to slot in above City. At best we'll be who we were 5 years after the Roman revolution, but with tougher domestic competition.     On the plus side, a resurgent Chelsea probably squeezes Spurs out of the big 6 for good. I'd say a bn easily. Ronaldo and Kaka were both recent balon dor winners, still in their 20s, and would (rightfully) cost more than mbappe would go for if not for a free transfer. Those 2 alone would be more than half a bn. Alonso was a well established world class DM, and benzema was a proven young talent who was a man among children in ligue 1 at a young age of ~~15~~ 21. You don't get either of them for less than 100mn these days. Add in abeloa, abiol. Shits stacked But chelsea basically just spent a half bill? Yeah, they won one league in the next 4 years, and dropped out of the chl in the round of 16 in '10. But with the decima in '14, using those players (except Kaka) they started an impressive trophy hunt. Unfortunately, as I support their rivals. Yeah and… there’s not a single Chelsea fan out there right now who’s happy with our performance the past 5 years, sans the UCL run. We’ve been quite the mess in the league for a while now. City is a very well run club. They know how to use their money.   Even their youth teams are run really well. It's because after the first couple of years of Abramovich investment he toned it down comparatively and started investing more in things like the academy.   Then these insane people took over and blew Abramovich out of the water.   In you look at net spend for the ten years before the new owners of Chelsea than Chelsea had a lower net spend than City, United and Arsenal in that period because of their excellence in selling. It's only just gone past them in the last few windows in terms of net. It's so funny that they won the UCL way before the other two clubs spending billions Hate to defend chelski, but they are arguably the best selling team. Look at how they scammed us for mount.   They sell very well and can mostly fund their spending sprees cause of it. Take out the Clearlake spending and it was an insanely successful time under Roman for the amount of money spent  Not sure what the total was in the 20 years he was here but wouldn't be surprised if other clubs were there or thereabouts >successful enough  I get what you’re saying but we have been the second most successful English side in the last 20 years in terms of major trophies won, including the 4 European Cups.   Sure, outside of Mou’s 2004-07 built team you can’t really point to a dominant succession of time. If you measure that with what Pep’s accomplished with this City then sure I guess you’re right. Personally, I’m fine with that with context provided.   We brought out an even more competitive United and genius in Fergie, City took lessons from Roman’s tenure and approached their vision in a more structured way to enable Pep to get on with it. Liverpool enjoyed an almost resurgence under Brendan before Klopp coached them to another level.    Under Roman’s tenure, we kept winning major silverware in most seasons. Some of our most chaotic seasons led to the biggest prizes, even when we weren’t challenging for the title.  So personally, I think we were plenty successful despite City set the bar now. Chelsea are the 2nd most successful team in England in the last 2 decades and have 2 UCLS. Not many more clubs in Europe who have been more successful in that era, outside the obvious Bayern and Madrid. Clubs like United have spent tons of money with only an FA cup to show for it. If you’re gonna hate on our spending, preach our success and the profits we’ve made as well Because most of that money was spent in the last 2 years on players whose value was in their potential? Cries in 2 CLs As a Chelsea fan, I cannot disagree. True, we've also been the most fun to follow during that time. You might say I'm rationalizing for missing out on trophies, but I honestly believe our constant cycle of turmoil then glory is better than what City and Madrid are doing.  I just want to forget my worries when I'm occupied with my team. I mean, isn't that the point of all this? We’ve sold the most also. Our buy sell ratio was pretty good until lukaku and the new owners. Then everything went to shit. I've been on AI seminar from a guy who works for Premier league team and he said that even with all of these tools and expert scouts, clubs seem to waste money quite often.  But Chelsea was the worst example by far. 4? More closer to 10 As long as they make more money than they spend they're a good club no? The last 4 years absolutely, but Chelsea were the most successful team over the 2010’s in england We've won two CLs with two different managers and Man City only won once and that's only with the greatest manager of all time, Pep, What will happen after he leaves? We will always find success no matter the manager. Eh. 2 Champions leagues, 4 league titles, 5 FA Cups, 3 League Cups, 2 Europa leagues is success.  Between 2004-2024, only Barca and Real have won more CL than them I thought this was the Rio Ole pasta at first We've spent a lot but we've also had the highest revenue. Clubs like United have spent far more in relative terms and been less successful.  I think most Chelsea fans will agree with you that we haven't been successful enough given the financial advantage we have. We lost out marginally on a few titles/deep runs into the UCL when Abramovic took over meaning we weren't nearly as dominant as we should've been relative to our position financially. And then since FFP we've definitely been more inconsistent/haven't been run aswell as a club like City the last decade.  But part of the issue is also coaching. People may not like this because a lot of football fans seem to despise Pep, but if he'd been our manager the last 10 years, we likely would've won a hell of a lot more. Even Klopp tbh. The most important person in football is the manager. They can cover the cracks. Get a generational manager and everyone will probably be raving about your players and how well run the club is, but often half of it is down to him.  People don't have to agree with that tbh. I do think us and United have been run like shit or a while now, but put Pep and Klopp in charge and no one's talking about the issues. All the ""flops"" magically turn out as great signings because he best managers know how to properly profile and coach ther players. And there are so few of that calibre f manager at any given point, so if you're one of the clubs that doesn't have that top top manager, you're probably gonna be inconsistent for a while. Just look at the history of football and you'll see the patterns.  But yeah all Chelsea fans probably look at City's success and now think we should've won more. But we've also been lucky because we've still been run better than clubs like United. Not everyone can get blessed with one of the greatest managers of a generation and win 6 titles in 7 years. We spend more than most teams, but we also sell more so it balances out. Net spend up until these new owners come in was never ridiculously high and it's oo early to judge the success of the recent spending. Before the last couple of years, I think, man u had spent more over the decade with much less to show for it Na they were a small club from West London and now they are a ""legitimate big club"" the money worked in making them a global brand and big club, they are the original plastic club, that paved the way for the others. [deleted] Modern football must be in a good state if a club who’s spent a billion in 18 months and ends up mid table is all what’s wrong with it. We are worst ran club in london. Not even a debate at this point. So many millions wasted. Zero accountability from the higher ups, now trying to force homegrown talent out because of their mistakes. Its all only possible because Roman wiped $1b of debt off the books for nothing. Lets be real Everton fully deserve their punishments. They've run that club into ruin. Chelsea should be punished too, and i think they might well be at some point. They are probably knackered competitively anyway if they have another bad season  So far theyve managed to dodge it through creative accounting. Serious question, do you think there will be protests in the streets if you start the same as last year? Obviously you ended well, but it was literally a bottom half finish, until the turn around. All credit too, that thrashing to us spearheaded the end of the season The Mudryk transfer saga was peak r/soccer I think everyone missed the point and it’s not that complicated. The point is €1 billion is a lot of money. The hypothetical puts it into context what that kind of money buys if the individual/group spending it were altruistic. I could have just said the amount of money Chelsea spent on transfers post-Abramovich is equal to 2 billion cans of beans. I’m glad Ancelotti has said that It would have mattered the same it’s just pathetic that Chelsea spent over a billion euros and barely improved because of it. Just a textbook example of being totally wasteful. Millions going to a good cause would change the world for the better in ways you don’t even know, but in football that barely buys you a single reserve player. Any of the other teams on the list I can criticize for their gluttony, but Chelsea stick out for the sheer amount of spending and lack of return. The obvious complaint should be that Chelsea could have sent 2 billion Freddo bars to children in need a 12 year old would have more common sense than that What????. You know that sports and entertainment only create few jobs. They only contribute less than 5% of any countries GDP. Why do you think people with liberal arts degree work in Min wage jobs. Fuck off with your creating jobs angle. What are you, a Tory running for parliament?  It’s just a form of entertainment. And it’s a pretty terrible one. But by god is it entertaining. I was talking about players, but can you give me the sauce? Well, youre right but they still count Bartonomics in full force Barcelona? Noooooo A young Spanish central midfielder who plays tiki taka. That's textbook La Masia. He was 17 when we bought him. We sold him to Leeds Eibar(who he was on loan at) activated their buy option then we immediately activated a buyback clause iirc. And then he was sold(or loaned I don’t remember) to Getafe for 19/20 Stimulating the economy by taking on flops and one at a time, we bought the same player again, that previously we released for free, with big money of course, and released free again.. That too happened because of the shite we had in recuritment department. As soon as we got battered by brighton and brentford BOOM 170 mil for case and antony. ABSOLUTELY SHAMBLES AND RIDICULOUS. fcking fidget spinner. Pellegrini style Nah, AC Milan just made a great decision to sell him early as the signs were appearing in the final season already. He was still fine for Madrid in the first season but became injury prone pretty quickly after that, he played fine whenever he wasn't stricken by injury woes. Yeah that last parts the important bit.  By 2030 it'll have been over 20 years since the Man City take over and there's going to be a whole generation of teenagers who will never have known Man City as anything other than one of the most successful clubs in the world When Newcastle wins the league title and Pep leaves and City goes on a bit of a decline the stigma will shift to them. The cycle begins anew lol Don't worry, some of us still hate you more Start winning and we'll see we can’t let them forget Don’t forget all the stellar coaching decisions we’ve made over the past 3 years!  I have high hopes for Maresca, at least. MBS said he wants to make Saudia a sports entertainment hub for the rest of the globe. Hence the money spree on football, F1 and eSports I mean it works for America with their entertainment industry I think it will work with Saudi too so, we’ll see in a few decades if people start going to Saudi Even Danilo, wasn’t bad. He was versatile, and was sold for the same money shortly after. Just a keystone summer for city Np Yeah, percent of revenue definitely makes the most sense. I mean if you really look at it.   It's not that different, it's literally Russian oil vs Saudi oil. At the crux of it at least, that's how I see it. Not really. People complain about state-run clubs because they have access to unlimited resources and they act in bad faith. Chelsea and Abramovich were no different. There is a difference, but only nominally. Abramovich was not a random private banker. The Russian oligarchs are all inextricably linked to the deeply corrupt government, and Abramovich more than most. There is no question that he wielded a not insignificant amount of actual state power. Not Chelsea owned by a guy funding a dictator and war What do you mean people even hated Man United lol? They have been and continue to be the most hated club in England People hate United now lmao not what I meant City had 1 more major trophy in their pre-takeover history.  And more harmful for their reputation is that their takeover came on the back of several decades of really poor performances for the club. Whereas Chelsea's came following fighting for the title with Treble winners and being in European competitions. Different sport but Dodgers spent more than their annual revenue on one player, obviously amortized but still absolutely insane Imagine just being a guy, and then someone sells all their prime real estate in a major EU capital for you to play football with them. didnt i just see something saying they broke the 1 Billion mark? Take away the Ballon d'Or winner from two years prior (Kaka) and it's still the greatest. BlueCos tenure has been a disaster and will only get worse as none of these project players will have a consistent manager, in addition to the general difficulties of developing project players (racist instagram lives not withstanding). Unfortunately Tottenham stadium revenue is immense and they are generally not particular lavish in transfer windows. Meanwhile our matchday revenue will suffer if our performances stay like this. Gives me no pleasure to say it but Spurs are much better positioned. Frankly this pretty much the last chance BlueCo have. If Maresca gets sacked — and nothing against him but chances are he will — this generation of players is basically lost and none of these guys will ever be profitable sales — barring Cole Palmer, who both seems unlikely to stick around a non-CL team and whose sale would lead to a fan revolt. >On the plus side, a resurgent Chelsea probably squeezes Spurs out of the big 6 for good.  Or - and just hear me out - Chelsea continue to sputter, before ultimately going down in a fiery crash?  I like that possibility more. Much more. lmao, nice Spot on I meant the level of player being acquired in one window, I did also say over half a billion. That's always been Chelsea's MO since Roman took over no? Look like a mess one month and then getting silverware the next. Well they got the Barca sistem of the early 2010 To be fair if there’s one thing Chelsea do well it’s youth recruitment and development Do you really think there aren’t any under the table. City fudges their numbers though. 50 million on paper for Haalad and that Savio purchase was a joke. They were a very well run club. Currently they're a mess. Roman and Marina kept making massive dumb signings but they were covered by oddly high players sales. We still have the most expensive keeper and Belgian flop on our books. Roman never spent wisely. Don't forget your Moratas, Torres and Pulisic who all came after the initial spending period of the early2000s To be fair they had a bit of a head start over the others Scenes when blud finds out that the only reason Chelsea are not under administration is because Abramovich gave up the €2bn something that was owed to him. This is on top of selling yourself the hotel, car park, etc. shenanigans.   They absolutely are not a sustainable club by any means. Hasn’t mount not really had a consistent run of matches to determine that yet? Have you got any more examples? The trick is they convince everyone that they’re so poorly run that every one of their players has vast upside potential.  Their sales strategy for years is “look at this man, playing so well at such a basket-case of a club. Imagine how good he could be at a well-run institution, 60m will feel like a steal.” Because they created pretty bad loan army also. Lot of youngsters made the buck back for them. Lol they had 1.3bn in debt forgiven for nothing by Roman when they left. They haven't been funding their spending spree with sales post Roman either. This is just demonstrably false. Crazy it has so many upvotes. Adjusted for inflation, Roman's first 2 years were much higher than Boehly's last 2.  You guys were spending close to 200m in an era when spending 70m was seen as ""breaking the bank"" That's fucking ridiculous tbh, this is not fm or fifa to bet everything on potentials and ifs. 1CL in the time period we're talking about. And jesus Christ, didn't realise how much you've spent. This is underachievement comparable to Man United in the 2010s. Even you know that those are the most ridiculous, flukey CL wins in the history of the CL. Di Matteo is a CL winning manager ffs. What a joke. Lots of managers can make those players successful. The problem is that Chelsea keeps firing people (and hiring the wrong ones sometimes too). I swear that club would’ve fired Klopp if he performed like he did in his first year at Liverpool. Shit, you guys would’ve fired Pep! Gotta love the no-flairs > We are worst ran club in ~~london~~ the world  ftfy Nah, just the worst fans in London. i am not saying they didn’t deserve the punishment. I’m saying that smaller clubs are punished awfuly quickly, while fuckers like Chelsea and Man City are chilling Nah, it's not so deep. I couldn't believe the goals you were scoring 🤣 I agree but you can say that about every industry. The smart phone industry revenue is in the trillions. > it’s just pathetic that Chelsea spent over a billion euros and barely improved because of it.  Then just say that instead of the weird-ass charity angle, since if you spend £1b to come 6th instead of £1bn to come 1st it's all just money spent on kicking a ball around. [deleted] Peri Peri or otherwise?  I think you are wondering about my comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/PremierLeague/comments/1d9vlg5/new\_chelsea\_avoided\_breaching\_the\_psr\_limit\_by/#:\~:text=Waaaaaaaaaasuup-,NEW%3A%20Chelsea%20avoided%20breaching%20the%20PSR%20limit%20by%20selling%20the,million%20deficit%20for%20the%20club. Not true at all, tiki taka has been adopted by most Spanish clubs and especially the National team. Pedri was never a Barcelona youth, he came from La Palmas. Most La Masia graduates never stay that long because they don’t get enough playing time or are just flops. Few like Gavi and Lamine Yamal truly shine, pretty much like any other club. And thus began my love hate relationship with him We pulled that money straight out of the couch i still dont know how we found that money after crying broke all summer I remember Mourinho benching Kaka for Ozil a lot through the early 10s, even when kaka was fit. I do agree though that he became very injury prone, that's the reason Ozil was able to replace him so quickly. No doubt Ozil would've replaced him as he got older, but Kaka's injuries just fast-tracked that process. Kind of funny because I personally feel happy for the Newcastle fans that may get to experience success now. The club's not been competitive for ages and the Ashley years were awful. Same for City fans that were around when you were in Div 1. Same for Chelsea fans that remember the 80s. You can't help but feel happy for fans that finally get to see their club win something. So much more fulfilling than watching a United fan win their 13th Prem.  But then after 20 years of the Chelsea takeover, 15 years of the City takeover etc, those clubs accumulate millions of bandwagon fans. Means people associate those clubs with entitlement, glory hunting etc and they become hated.  Idk like I hate where the money comes from (even as a Chelsea fan), but I only feel happy for Newcastle fans rn. And I can't be the only one. But I know in 15-20 years time they'll be public enemy number 1. It's probably the Chelsea fan in me, but I'll always hate the 'traditional' big clubs like Arsenal, United and Liverpool more than the newcomers that break up the monopoly. Don't agree with how Roman, the Saudis etc have operated, but still would rather see City or Newcastle win something than Arsenal, Liverpool and United. Very unpopular opinion among the wider football fanbase of course. But football would be even more boring than it is now if United had been the ones that had won 6 of the last 7 titles. At least it's someone different and a different set of fans get to experience the euphoria of a dominant era. Oh I know dw 😂  I don't really think about you guys too much if I'm being honest. You're a bit like Fulham or QPR. Plus creating that new competitor to PGA (Liv1?) and scrunching themselves into WWE's annual pay per view schedule. The minor issue is that the US isn’t a religious oligarchy that systemically represses half of their population through religious doctrine. Of course there are huge disparities between social rights in the US that has come through institutionalised racism, but let’s be real, Saudi is a whole different ballpark.   Why would women go to a country where they are legally second class citizens? Where being gay is punishable by death. They’re different in the sense that state owned clubs have a lot more political clout to undermine the integrity of the game. It’s not really close to the same. That’s why he’s not the owner anymore right? They are not the most hated right now. Used to be. City is probably right now along with PSG. First FA cup won by a Manchester team belongs to the blues what do you mean Sho? Helps that he deferred like 68 million a year because he makes 100 million in endorsements How did that work out for them? (Idk anything about the sport) Was that salary or transfer costs? Cause here, its transfer costs and not salary that are counted Don’t care I was working of the published 22/23 accounts (https://www.deloitte.com/uk/en/services/financial-advisory/analysis/deloitte-football-money-league.html), but yeah two hours before my comment there was a press announcement about 1 billion in 23/24. There's no way Spurs are better positioned. Even with the impending limitations our strategy of the last two years will impose, we'll still have more financial might than them.     Spurs' problem is that for the next few years, Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Man Utd and Chelsea already have better squads and more money to improve those squads. The spending part is business as usual, but previously Spurs were the only club likely to be in position to take advantage of bad seasons by the bigger dogs. Now you have Newcastle and Villa poised to compete for those Champions League places. It was bad enough when 6 into 4 didn't go, but now it's 5 + 3 into 4. Entirely possible, though I don't think I'm capable of enough pessimism to embrace a dystopian future of that magnitude. Which is a viable strategy for winning knockout competitions , which have done alright at over the last few years, but doesn't hold you to a title challenge. We've not had a sustained title challenge since we last won it in 2017 Often overlooked that before they got Pep they brought in all the front office personnel familiar with his play style who know what profiles will succeed with him. Txiki deserves  a lot of credit for City's success. Eh. All they do is loan out 25 youngsters every year to sink or swim. You think other clubs are willingly making themselves an accessory to our financial crimes?  Inflating sponsorships is one thing but faking transfer fees makes absolutely no sense. None of these windows include agent fees.  Haaland for 50m wasn’t “fudging the numbers” it was the amount that Dortmund received which is what is typically reported. Haaland just had bigger agent fees than what was typical. A mess how? It's why I always chuckled when I saw Chelsea fans moving mad in all the barca threads that get posted about their financial situation. People who support bank rolled teams have no right to look down upon fan owned clubs, yes that includes my club. Our new owners are far richer than Abramovich, and a lot of our past spending was erased with the new PSR rules going to a season by season model. Thats sort of irrelevant  He had 1 year left, chelsea wanted him out, he wanted out. We paid 55m for him. We paid double what any other team wouldve paid given the circumstances. He's played whenever he's been fit and has been a complete ghost.  Utter waste of £55M on a position that only needed filling in EtH's fever dream tactic. Morata, Havertz, Hazard, Abraham, David Luiz x2, Costa, Matic, Oscar, Courtious  Lower sales like Tomori, Guehi, Jorginho, Koulibaly were good value as well This summer alone they got 101m fron maatsen, hall and hutchison. 101m on pure profit cause academy lads.   Last summer they sold 128m worth of players who had little book value left or were academy lads, sona big % of that was pure profit.  Summer prior they got 130m~ from zouma, abraham, tomori and gueghi, 130m pure profit.  In the past 3 summers chelsea has sold 360m~ worth of players for pure profit. And we were successful in that period? The argument is that we've spent more than other teams and not had the success to match. That only applies to recent years. When Roman came in an spent that ridiculous amount of money, it translated to almost instant success. Unless you're going back in time and picking apart the times we finished 2nd narrowly to United or lost out in the UCL semis/finals in the 2000s, I don't know how you can say the money spent back then didn't translate to proportionate success. The spending basically took us from a 4th-6th club to a team that challenged for the league and went deep in the UCL every season.  It's the recent spending that has (and should) get criticism. Because it's higher than everyone else and we're still mid. But it's also early days because the spending's all been on young players tied down to long contracts. If we don't make progress this season and start closing the gap to City, I'll be the first one saying we spunked the money. But a season or two after the spending is too soon to make a judgment imo. What is Palmer, Nkunku, Jackson, Caicedo etc actually make us a competitive team this season? It's not outside the realm of possibility. Oh no. The CLs are flukey.      Makes up for the one stolen from us if anything.      Not that the last CL was even flukey. We were the better team and won each round. How flukey. Nothing fluky about the 20-21 run. They completely controlled every single round of that tournament; teams couldn't get a sniff on goal.  As for the 11-12 run; yes, incredibly fluky. But on the balance 1 CL title from that era is no more than Chelsea deserved given how unlucky they were in all the previous campaigns. 08 they lost because Terry slipped on the winning penalty attempt. 09 they were robbed blind. A couple of the other runs were epics where they just came up short at the wrong time (thinking of the Liverpool matchups in particular). Worst club and worst fans. Both are true Can you explain where Chelsea broke the rules and deserve a points deduction? Chelsea have already been transefer banned twice and very expediently. First time it was overruled eventually, but we are certainly not the same as City in that regard. What are you mad at the clubs for?   Blame the authorities for that. That game was crazy, almost had the  most fugazi Ben White hattrick too Oh nah i didnt mean just our game specifically, i meant if your 15 matches into the season and youre sitting bottom half again. I cant imagine that will be tolerated from the locals, given the spending Yeah no doubt. My point isn’t any deeper than that. Im just putting it into context because people forget just how much a billion is. None of the other teams spent €1 billion over 3 consecutive windows. And if your goal is to challenge for the title with that money but come mid table thats rather wasteful. You could still argue that in the bigger picture, €1 billion to win the league is still wasteful. Idk how this became a bigger discussion than it needed to be. Obviously football has a role in society and the overall economy. I basically just said €1 billion is a lot of money spent by a single club over a year and I gave a hypothetical of what that is if it was spent on an altruistic endeavor. You do realize that micro and macro economics is 2  different things right. You are one of those people who have no basic idea how things work. Thanks How does any of what you said make it untrue? Barca are known for tiki taka. Doesn’t stop the teams also doing it… It's all GLAZERNOMICS man they just wanna pocket as much as they want but things went SOUTH QUITE QUICKLY LOL. I mean you cant compare the US now that they’ve won the world propaganda. You have to compare when they were new money, like how Saudi is currently the new money.   Now let’s go back to early 1900s when the world empires were falling apart and that’s when the US started to penetrate the “good country image”. This is the same time that they still had segregation, killing of natives, and all the way to 2000s had wars in countries across the world with no benefit for their own people or those countries people except for money. Like if you just wanna say “religion = bad”, sure. But you cant really compare how lavish Saudi people live their lives compared to Americans did to their own people. Saudis right now literally get free everything, free education healthcare no interest mortgages AND monthly allowance from their government to the whatever the fuck they want. Comparing to Americans when they were growing? You think Saudis will make their people go to war in Yemen like how Americans did to Vietnam?  Now, the problem with Saudi is that they cant get away from their religious image. So the same way Americans got away with it with Hollywood, and Japan got away with it with Anime, Saudi will eventually get away with it with sportswashing and other ventures.   Now you can say, why would Japanese people go to America after their whole internment camp fiasco, or Africans go to america after knowing what they did to african-americans, or Koreans or Chinese people go to Japan after what Japanese people did to them? Turns out people’s opinion about a country can change very easily after entertainment propaganda Are you taking the piss? Abramovich was responsible for putting Putin into power and had a direct line to the Kremlin. Also got special provisions from the government to sell off assets when a bunch of other oligarchs had theirs seized. Never stopped your whole stadium chanting his name Paris Saint-Grimsby? Yessir The entire Japanese advertising industry runs on Shohei's face And we won’t talk about the gambling He’s on his first year and playing really well, but too early to tell, they’re a very wealthy team though so I think they’ll be fine Well he's on track for MVP this season even though he's playing the rough equivalent of a substitute all whilst recovering from a surgery that doesn't allow him to pitch for this season. Salary, he was a free agent Txiki will be just as big a loss for us as Pep is when he leaves, which iirc he's said he'll leave when Pep does This is something that isn't included in all the spending figures either.   Sure, they have had great net spend in recent years, but a huge amount of it is down to them spending millions bringing in all the best coaches and hoovering up every talented youth player.   They're run extremely well, but every part of the operation is swimming in cash. Soriano is the architect behind the success. He offered Barca the same model before City. Well that's just not true is it. Our Cl final squad had 5 academy products, City had 4 between their two finals and none of them even started the final won. Yeah, odd coming from a Utd fan. We bought Bebe as a supplemental fee to the De Gea deal. Ffs Oh shit I'm an idiot. My bad just re read the comment. City are exceptionally run. I'm assuming he thought the comment he replied to was talking about Chelsea? They've spent billions and aren't even in the champions league? They're overpaying for youngsters whilst forcing out academy products who imporved their team when played? They're board is deeply unpopular and disconnected from the fanbase? They sacked a manager the second he had actually implemented his style and replaced him with a worse manager? They've spent a bunch of money on shit? Then there's other stuff like cancelling the busses and generally cheaping out on the fans whilst wasting hundreds of millions on players like mudryk and sterling? Not sure how Chelsea wanted him out if they offered him a contract before he left. It was his decision to leave. I think that says more about United than Chelsea. In general Chelsea is pretty quick to cut their losses, but they’re still taking losses on all the players they bring in for massive fees who subsequently disappoint. Pretty good examples, I gotta hand it to ya The Morata sale is what convinced me that, these teams are all money laundering fronts because wtf? Plus during the Roman era we purchased Hazard for 30m in 2012 and Kante for 33m in 2016. Then of course we had some disasters like Lakaka. Well yeah it's the only way they have managed to just stay in line with the rules, that and initially doing that ridiculous contract loophole stuff. They have spent over a billion in 2 years, sounds ridiculous to even say that and what do they have to show for it. Exactly, he bought the club in 2003 and made us PL champions in 2005 lol. Bro you switched managers half way through and Havertz scored a goal in the final.  It was a fluke. [deleted] It's very unlikely that we will be bottom half. We literally have at least 3 players that are basically like new signings this season in Lavia, Nkunku and Fofana (of course, they have to stay fit), and I trust Maresca to set us up much better tactically than Poch ever did, because there was no defensive system, just vibes. Plus Palmer has already settled in, so he will be ready to go. Oh, please stop mentally weak and stop crying on the internet as usual. The dortmund choked in the league and Champions League finals. Why don't you put in to context Dortmund's spending relative to how many Wells you could buy? Your point applies to every top flight club in Europe. Your problem is how much money gets spent on football, yet you're trying to make out like it's a Chelsea problem. Stop using charity and people in need of money as a vehicle to have a dig at a club you don't like. Your club is a big part of the ""problem"" too, eventhough the problem you have isn't even a football problem, it's just capitalism. This is an argument that I constantly see from Saudi shills. ‘You have to compare the countries to when they were new.’ You don’t actually, because unsurprisingly, the morales of society and the world were totally different when the US was becoming a super power! And unsurprisingly, we don’t live in the 1800s. It’s 2024.  Having free healthcare and the like is truly wonderful - except if you’re a woman, who has to get permission from a man in order to go to the doctor, get drugs, etc. Then have to show a marriage when going to a neo-natal doctor because sex outside of marriage is illegal. Or - if you’re one of the 13 million non Saudi’s who do not get those luxuries. But yes, SAUDI MEN have such lavish and luxurious lifestyles! (not discounting the GDP per capita of the US being over double that of Saudi) It’s just a shame that almost 3/4 of the entire population have far, far, far fewer legal rights than the men do.   Saudi cannot get away from their ‘religious image’, because the country is a fucking religious oligarchy. Their rules are determined by the national religion - which is also one of the most repressive forms of Islam. Hollywood didn’t try to hide slavery from the world. Slavery movies are actually some of the most important and famous movies ever made (Roots, 12 Years a Slave). In fact, the first ever film shown in the White House was in effect a pro-slavery movie. Which is ironic, considering that Saudi Arabia STILL has the Kafala system, which is modern day slavery.   Slavery, and the Internment Camps are a disgusting stain on the history of the US and the world - but it’s something that the US has owned up to - there’s a distinct reason why Abraham Lincoln is seen as the best President ever. But go ahead, use your ‘whataboutisms’ for a conversation that has absolutely nothing to do with the US or Japan.  And surprisingly, people don’t really want to go live or visit a place where the country has 50°C+ heat, where gay people are executed, where minorities are treated with disgusting attitudes, where women legally do not have anywhere near the same rights as men. It just shows what kind of person you are to even try to compare it. And that’s still significantly different than being a state run club…are you taking the piss?      Mind you, I’m not saying the prem should have ever let Roman own a team either. But it’s still not the same. Yes it is / was wildly different. You never heard stories of David Cameron, Putin and Abramovic having urgent meetings as a direct result of a Chelsea player entertaining the idea of not renewing his contract. That was exactly what happened with Mbappe and France last few summers and that really reeked. You can say a lot of shit about about Abramovic and how he and other Oligarchs came to power and wealth, but at least he just bankrolled the operation and did not meddle directly himself and did not exert his influence on heads of state in order for his football team to succeed... Trust me, it’s not the whole stadium even tho it’s too many. You won’t hear me defend our match going fans. Damn, I didn't know he was that expensive I know I am an Angels fan, like 85% of the ads at our Stadium when he was here were Japanese companies. He is on TV every 30 minutes, it’s insane Probably because he didn't do anything Thanks for the info :) Good, get them both out of here. I'm sick and tired of the ""we cannot do this, this is more of a challenge than you believe"" routine Pep pulls out every January only to win the league by 5+ points. I'm tired, more than you believe. Thank god some good news https://www.occrp.org/en/cyprus-confidential/abramovichs-secret-football-payments-may-have-breached-financial-fair-play-rules Haha mistakes happen sometimes. City despite their dodgy finances have performed well off the pitch That makes sense I suppose, Chelsea made fewer rash decisions under Abramovich The guy you replied to was talking about City not Chelsea You're absolutely right about Chelsea being poorly managed lately. However, the original comment was about Manchester City not Chelsea, which is why I was confused. They offered him a contract that was way off his request and then wouldn’t budge. So I guess they didn’t want him out per se but didn’t value him that highly. Brother chelsea currently has sold 101m of academy kids in 3 sales.. It made absolutely no sense from Athletico to buy Morata for 56m lmao. I read the news and just laughed. Marina will go down as one of the best at player sales. I think he's the worst transfer of all time right? The long contracts aren’t a loophole, it’s not even sneaky. It’s always been allowed it’s just risky as hell. The amortization rule for ffp was pretty simple, now in hindsight it looks like a loophole since they changed the rule to the 5 year max but that doesn’t mean it was shady at the time. Don’t get me wrong, the owners are using loopholes by selling assets to themselves but the player contracts weren’t one of them. We don't have the highest wages though. I think we're 3rd or 4th We switched managers and played better than everyone we played against. That’s not a fluke.      We beat City 3 times that season. Tbf Chelsea would have failed PSR if not for the hotel sale and other shenanigans. So yes you're technically correct, but its through abuse of loopholes that they have complied, they absolutely overspent.  And overall it is bad for the long term future of the club for it sell off its assets for short term gain. Next it'll be the stadium or training ground if they're not careful and thats a bad place for the club to be in. Im curious if palmer can hit the ground running. Had some pretty decent euro showings, when he got his chance. I'm expecting the opposite really, our attackers thrived in the chaos and attacking football we played, one of our best goal scoring seasons, and I also expect we win less penalties because of how slow we will play under him compared to last season. Good one dude Dude it’s not a big deal and it’s not like I’m trying to demonize Chelsea for not building 200,000 wells in Africa. I’m critical of their spending and how effective it is but thats beside the point. I just gave a single example using Chelsea, who is historically one of the biggest spenders in football and specifically in the span of a year spent €1 billion. They’re at the top of the list in the original post. It’s not crazy that I used them for a simple hypothetical but you don’t have to take it personally. The whole point of my comment is that €1 billion is a lot of money and what that looks like and it didn’t have to be deeper than that. Non-American here, was he worth the fee paid? Sounds like he gotta be the CR7 of Baseball. Fuck it. Even Coors Light runs an ads campaign when ohtani broke LED board with his hit. You can google ""Coors Light Out Campaign""  He's basically midas. Well he absolutely employed the guy Logo checks out Imagine how sick fans of title challenging clubs are Lmao like clockwork, next thing you know we’ve gone 13 games unbeaten 😂 Would love to hear what Pep tells his missus when she's asks him to take out the bins They offered him 200k to stay. He was on 75k a week before that. It's already a huge improvement from the previous one. But he accepted Man United 250k deal. Just greedy for money. Chalobah incoming soon. Another pure profit. Sad to see but that's how they run this club now. They will be buying more kids and turning up doubles on them. Unfortunately my club is good at selling. Got to be Shevchenko - [adjusted for inflation his fee was £215m](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12950536/premier-league-transfers-andriy-shevchenko-and-rio-ferdinand-top-all-time-inflation-adjusted-fees) All things considered he is. Fernando Torres comes close It was clearly shady at the time because they closed the loophole as soon as Chelsea leaned into it Something would be very very wrong if the group of players you have were on the highest wages, you've spent a billion and I'm serious I wouldn't take many of your players for the villa. month\* 10 year, 700 million contract. Ohtani is someone baseball has not seen since Babe Ruth, he pitches and bats at an elite level. He is ridiculous and if he continues the trajectory he is in for the next decade (big if), he can easily be considered the GOAT. He’s genuinely in contention to go down as the greatest baseball player of all time. There hasn’t been someone who can both hit and pitch like him since Babe Ruth.  There’s also some fancy accounting with the contract, most of it’s deferred with no interest until 2034 at which point it’ll seem much more reasonable. What the other guy said and he’s Japanese. Baseball is really big in Japan and this once in a lifetime talent is the best player the MLB may ever see. Absolutely worth the money. He's like CR7+Casillas in one player. Not Messi levels in one area but league top level batter and pitcher at the same time. So European Golden boot contender and best goalkeeper contender all at once. Something that was thought to be impossible in modern baseball. He was employed by the Dodgers, not Ohtani. And even if Shohei himself had been gambling this whole time, which the investigation shows that Ippei was stealing from him to do so, the only thing that would've been illegal was the fact that he was using an illegal bookie. Ippei wasn't even betting on Baseball. Lmao Absolutely not. Torres gave us one good season in 2013. Was immense in that Europa league win and gave here and there moments like Nou Camp equaliser. While Lakaka is the worst because not only did he cost us 100 m, he scored 10-12 goals in return. In 4 months gave an interview to want to return to Inter and broke the team's dressing room atmosphere. He is the worst of all. Proper snake and an opportunist. Wow! Sounds interesting. Thank you He’s already had Tommy john surgery twice. He’s an amazing player but he won’t come close to Bonds in my opinion his manager mis-managed his finances? placed some bets idk? I never alleged betting on baseball, only that he could potentially have even more money He's very unique. Imagine a player who could play Neuer level of GK but also score as much as CR7 or Messi. Since Baseball is turn-based, he can do both during the same game. Nobody has ever done it before in Baseball since Babe Ruth (like 100 years ago). Obviously you want him to be able to pitch but given he's an elite hitter if he somehow never pitches again he is still an impact player Yeah but given the way he has presented himself since day one, even before he arrived to the MLB, it just doesn't make sense. He used to give his money to his mom and live off of $1000 a month. Unless this guy is the most convincing actor we've seen, I don't think there's a reason to believe the results of the investigation aren't true. yo that's crazy. i had heard of ohtani but not being familiar with baseball i didn't know the skills were this far apart or that the combo was that rare. the babe ruth comp is hard for me to grasp as well, is he still impressive to this day? seems hard to imagine given that the dude played so long ago and didn't look especially athletic Absolutely. Even as a batter he’s one of the best Tbh I don’t know what’s the average MLB’s fan opinion on this as I’m not from the USA, but Ruth played in an era where there were different rules, stadiums were smaller iirc, even bats where bigger and heavier, and a fastball back then was slow as hell compared to now. So he was the greatest back then but someone like Ohtani is just miles and miles better given how much the sport has evolved i see, that makes sense"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* I was starting to get worried, it’s past 3:00pm, and Chelsea still hadn’t made their daily signing. Now I can relax. How are they gonna give everyone minutes This one actually makes sense in that we play Wolves away in our second game this season, and we have just made that a more favorable matchup by buying their player. I see the vision, only 18 more signings to go. Another day, another Chelsea transfer. Just incredible at this point. good for chelsea, squad was getting too thin Do they really need another super injury-prone player? Suits Maresca’s style of play as he likes direct wingers.   The problem is that he can’t stay fit, missed 23 games last season and 27 the season before. Maresca everyday in training: Oi mate who the fuck are you?!! Might actually be the best club for him with all the options they'll have Since this image came out 4 days ago apparently Chelsea have signed 3 more players: https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1elm6zs/chelsea_squad_202425/ Damn 24 almost seems old by Chelsea standards these days Genuinely how are they affording this The first semi-solid player they signed this transfer window I'm happy we're targeting a senior player, but that much for an injury-prone player, ugh... Fuck football. Seriously. How are Chelsea still spending? This is ridiculous This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Chelsea have an illness lol Mendes cooking Chelsea are a human trafficking organisation I think Neto is a great player. But looking at this Chelsea team, I have no idea what the plan is. None of these players have similar profiles I don’t know why everyone’s making fun of our transfer strategy, it’s obviously genius: if no one else has any players then we’ll win all of our games by default If you sign for Chelsea and never show up for training, block the staff and the manager on social media, then they'd never know you actually belong to the club. You can just sit at home and earn easy money for 7 years. Infinite money glitch. What's even the planned frontline at this point? Signings will be made until morale improves That's not a bad fee for Neto provided he can stay fit. omg ew a 24 year old , what a shit transfer   jk i am hyped How do they convince these players to sign for them is my question. If I was a player and a saw a team with 70 players no way in hell I sign for them. Genuine question, how are Chelsea not being absolutely pummeled by FFP? HOW.  ANSWER ME It's all fun and games until they actually sign a first teamer. The year is 2050 every player is signed with Chelsea, and loaned out to other clubs Chelsea are absolutely cooking the system but a lot of people don't seem to understand that the fees aren't just going into the book as red for this season. A £60m player whos on a 5 years contract would be a £12m a year cost on the books, some of their players were amortized over 8 years before that loophole was plugged but I think the ones they got through are grandfathered in.  I still don't get how they're doing it because of the shear amount of business/incomings they're getting and because of how massive their wage bill must be but the the amounts against each year for transfer fees are probably less than people think.   At the very least I have to imagine they'll be needing to continue bringing in £100m+ PSR money to keep it all moving every year, which isn't a guarantee, if they have one money where they can't make a lot of profit I feel they could quickly run into trouble. Huh? Out of no where Tbf, unlike about 90% of transfers they make atm, this one does actually improve Chelsea. He’s better than Mudryk and Madueke, and some would argue he’s better than Sterling aswell. Only negative about the deal for Chelsea is his injury record. But if he can stay, it could end up being a good signing. Who needs to rotate and manage minuted for players when you can have 500 players and just play the 11 that are fit at the same time. Going to be super tough to make it into the Chelsea 2025 Calendar this year. On the plus, everyone can buy their players back cheaper when this all blows up in their faces. Time to sell another hotel Isn't his main position RW? A position where Palmer will play because Nkunku will be at 10 and they have Madueke on the bench? Who are they buying tomorrow? Chelsea about to be renamed ""Frustrated with lack of playing time"" FC Gunna have to find a few more hotels to sell to themselves Yeah I heard Chelsea were lacking good right wingers We need and deserve a transfer ban. Seriously, lol. There’s ZERO chance Chelsea won’t get massive point deductions and/or other sanctions in the near future. This must backfire sooner than later  This is actually a decent signing for them tbh, assuming he stays fit. With how good Rodrigo Gomes and chiquinho have looked I’m not fussed about this sale. Such an incredible player for us but way too many injury issues.   Hope to invest it in  a solid left winger and maybe a midfielder and cb.   Wolves gonna surprise people this year. Chelsea really need another injury prone player .. at least he's good I guess When Chelsea go bankrupt I’ll be crying tears of joy Wow amazing actual quality 1st team player....   In the same position as their star player from last season, marvellous! Sad, but think it’s probably best to cash in now given his injury record. I also wonder how he’ll do in a more possession based side, considering he’s at his best counterattacking and running at players. If you told me a few years ago I would be praying for my own club to get a transfer ban, I’d call you a lunatic. But here we are… The memes keep writing themselves Is the plan for sales to just peddle enough bullshit in the media that eventually rumours just become true? There's surely no way they can either afford to spend like this without breaking rules or give these players even half the playing time they would want or expect? I watch a lot of football.  Couldn’t name Chelsea’s starting XI if my life depended on it.   Just a casual £300M+ summer transfer window from them. Is this the Mudryk experiment over? 70m down the drain there, good stuff Can’t wait for the 7 bullshit reports per day of “NEWCASTLE WANT MADUEKE” as the Chelsea media shills actively try to drive him out of the club Actual disgusting club Okay that was fucking fast That was fast Seen this described as reckless and I think that is quite accurate. Surely must be better options than another injury prone player. Just Osimhen left to sign and Chelsea are done this window They’ve made the premier league, and their punishments of Everton and Forest, look like absolute fools. An actual decent player who can slot in first team? Instead of a 19 year old brazilian? Is clearlake going sane? 😲 Chelsea locker room gonna be hella crowded Under 25, so he just barely makes the cut One starting 11 for each competition. People don’t hate Chelsea enough because they‘re shit but Shady Finances FC have been a cancer to football for too long now. Why are they still buying players, theyre just digging a deeper hole for themselves, they already owe about 200m in amortisation costs every season He'd be worth the money if it wasn't for the fact he stays injured for half a season. Means wolves are signing someone/people from Chelsea for 50 million chelsea are a disgrace Chelsea deserve whatever is coming to them, rarely seen ownership so clueless. It's not even that this is a bad signing, he's a good player but these fuckers are all over the place signing anything that moves every year, no consistency no continuity just throwing shit and hoping it sticks. This is actually a signing for Chelsea that will improve their current 11 for once.  Maybe after pissing away another €80+ million on young players with 20 appearances combined they'll sign a striker that's good or a CB that's half decent. 63 million for a player who has 11 league goals in 5 seasons at wolves and is super injury prone Where are we getting all this money out of Hey FFP wanna do something about this? I know everyone is joking here, but on a serious note, what is their strategy here? How is that legal, sustainable, or fair in any way? They spend billions and still have no sporting success, so they spend even more and more, throwing dozens of players at a wall, hoping that one or two stick. This ruins this sport so much, and all people do is joke about it. Gonna spend a season crocked there. Redundant signing. Squad is a mess [deleted] What a laughable football club.  That was quick. Fucking  helll This week on Londons biggest hoarders…… How are they not breaking any rules with all these signings? Wow that's a surprising move I am not sure if I understand what Chelsea is doing but I am very intrigued. X-fer window used to be my favorite time of the year, wondering which player we were gonna (over)pay for. Now I'm just numb... Sodom was smited for displaying less greed than this Bruh what  How  Where does this money keep coming from  Also, why would he even want to go there at this point  They really are buying a player a day aren't they Oh thank god. was genuinely extremely concerned for chelsea’s winger situation until I heard this 😭 Chelsea’s transfer strategy reminds me of someone who buys things from an infomercial for 5 installments of $20, saying it’s a bargain but eventually all that money has to be paid What the fuck! This came out of nowhere! When can we start expecting chelsea to challenge for the title considering they’re spending the gdp of Malawi every year on transfers? PSR does not exist? I’m not sure on how I feel about this tbh The Chelsea clown-tourbus keeps on going Good player but oh boy this club has no idea 😂 60m on a player who's injured as much as Reece James. Blimey. Surely wingers are the last place they need coverage right? How do you get any cohesion here. Do chelsea know that you cant make 11 subs at halftime like you can in friendlies? What a signing. superb talent if he remains injury free Chelsea fans, how does it feel when you sign players now? It’s such a common occurrence, I’d imagine it gets boring, no? someone take their hotels away to protect them from themselves I have to say good Signing Our left Wing is sorted now. Only Need Victor Osimhen needed 63 is heavy Ok seriously what are we doing guys Their wage bill must be fucking insane. I hope this ends in a massive disaster for them It's funny how the owners/directors have managed to unify pretty much every football fan in complete confusion and contempt towards what they're doing, including Chelsea fans. It's probably safe to say that even Chelsea fans are hoping to be hit with FFP soon just so the madness can end and we might be forced into focusing on the many players we do have. What a dumb signing for both parties lol.  Chelsea don’t need to spend that much on another forward and Neto struggles with minutes due to injuries anyway so will barely play What the fuck. Russian oligarchs and petrol states take notes, this is how you conduct transfer business HehehehehwHAHAHAHAHAHA Chelsea's purchasing reminds me of the housing situation in 07-08 We need a Boeing 737 to fit our squad Another $200m window what the fuck Now they'll try to sell Chalobah to balance the book, after the book is balanced they'll try to spend even more money PSR seems like a totally legit thing  30 signings, 0 trophies In the seven deadly sins, Chelsea definitely represent gluttony Dumb af signing. Why the fuck would he want to join that shitshow of a club I'm gonna go cry real quick What is Chelsea's amortized spending at now? Must be close to 150 mil no? I dont understand these guys. Wut I ask again….why not spend this money on a top striker (osimhen, Alvarez, Isak etc).   Signing another winger is moving mad Must be nice not having PSR apply to you.  Gonna need to sell themselves another womans team and a hotel before the end of the year. There is no plan at this club.  Just keep signing players and managers until something bubbles up to the surface. As a Chelsea fan I don’t understand anymore someone please help me understand. How many signings have Chelsea made this window? My god Place your bets for who's coming or going tomorrow right here Just out of curiosity, how many wingers do they have now? What exactly is Chelsea's long term squad building plan? It's funny that Chelsea seems to be taking Dortmund's approach of buy young, sell high. But instead are going buy high while they're young, fuck up their careers, then sell them for the same price or cheaper.  But I'll let a Chelsea fan tell me how they're definitely recouping over a billion spent on a few loan players that no one knows and never got a chance. If he stays healthy, he is quality Why is it in €? Two English teams. Seems like even a top tier journalist like Orny wants to inflate fees for clicks. Wtf is Chelsea’s starting 11 gonna be when they sign this many players lol. First ever soccer club who play starting 22 in history.  Starting 11 is not for chelsea Fuck off this shit is stupid Surely we have to be witnessing some of the worst business ever in the prem by chelsea over the last few years. This new manager signing everyone to 7+ year contracts is crazy and they have 8 goalies wtf What the hell is wrong with this football club Shit. That's an actually good signing. Jackson will have to return back to playing whatever other sport he used to play because it sure wasn't football. Aaaaaaand injured Squad is now [44](https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/men) & counting. Talk about squad depth! When are they going to get charged Hospital FC Noooooo fuck. Why'd they have to get this baller? Chelsea's transfer policy is to sign everyone so that each player kills one another for their position and only the strongest survives. Lmao you can't make this shit up As an Arsenal fan, srsly annoyed at how slow we get players over the line when you see other clubs moving quick like this FFS would 3m addons really be a deal breaker if they're getting 60m up front? i dont get this structure of payment. its like being able to afford a house in cash but still locking yourself into a tiny loan agreement to cover the final 5% of the fee just because If I have understood Chelsea correctly, some of their player will be going to Wolves for inflated price.  I am guessing Broja for 25m, which would be like 15m inflated Would seriously not be surprised if Boehly was unaware of registration limits 24yo is gonna be a like a grandpa on this squad. let me guess its a 7 year contract? ""PL money doesn't exist"" Absolute fraudulence What the hell. Chelsea with infinite money glitch. HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?!?!?!?!?!? Paper hamstrings Step 1. Buy as many players as you can Step 2. Loan them back to their home clubs Step 3. Profit? We laugh and are confused, but there are actual qualified people making these decisions aren't there? I don't mean the owners, I mean the scouts, the staff, whoever is in charge of transfer policy. Nearly every day it feels like for years, during summer and January it's like Chelsea have signed another player no one has any idea where they fit in. It really feels like now someone from the club should be explaining the logic. They make the job impossible for any manager. Please a transfer ban is all I need I'm available Chelsea, sign me. lmao Absolutely ridiculous I'm starting to think that Todd Boehly and co. Are trying to bankrupt Chelsea for some kind of compensation package; none of this makes sense any more... So that's why he was called up to the NT. Makes sense now! Money laundering machine let's go!!! Good, Chelsea made a signing today Are Chelsea moving to NFL or something with the squad they are accumulating? Collecting players like Pokemon, gotta catch’em all The same Chelsea that’s buying all the kindergarten kids? I like him but I don’t know how Chelsea justify that price with all his injuries and all the attacking options they already have Someone tell Chelsea to buy an Engineer from India. They're trained to warm benches anyway. Player wins, Chelsea enters a new market. It's a win - win. Is that not how this works? Do Chelsea Fans even know the names from all their players? 🧂🧂🧂 Loving these tears Chelsea have spent all this money and yet I’m somehow more concerned about West Ham being a threat. Shows just how terrible Boehly has been. Boehly probably does a line of coke and decides to make a new transfer just for the fun of it, then once he comes to his senses later on, decides to  buy a parking lot or a hotel that Chelsea owns to balance the books. At this rate they'll have more first team  players than fans So glad Poch was able to get out of this situation. what are they going to do with all those extra players they have amassed? Someone needs to take the credit card off Todd.  I’m happy to get Neto, he’s great but I don’t understand how we fit all these lads into the system.  It’s like Potter 2.0, overloaded with players. He’s an upgrade on the winger options we have now but he’s got an injury record as bad as Reece James. This is a panic buy. Challenging City for the 115 score Chelsea are like a dog who every time you turn your back it's trying to eat something it shouldn't be, but instead every time you look away they are spaffing millions up the wall on yet another new signing Are you fucking kitten me?! Roughly 35 league games missed in two seasons and only two league goals in the same period.   Plenty of red flags but if his hamstrings can last he’ll be one of their better signings. Screw Chelsea. Abhorrent management running the club. This is an absolute farce.  How is this legal and legit? God I hate them so much Sure 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 Letting these idiots spend a billion every year without punishment while Everton and Nottingham get point deductions left, right and center. Why? Why? These clueless clowns Good signing. Bit much for my liking but he's a quality LW who makes the team better. Just surprised Is it just me or do Wolves look like they're about to drop like a hammer? Finally a good transfer!! Great signing for them Genuinely feels like we're signing at least a player a day recently.   The club said they wanted the majority of their incomings to be done before pre-season started. Yet they're going absolutely insane after we've finished our tour. (Maybe not surprising given what a disaster it has been) A signing I've heard of, with little to no drama that isn't dragged out for weeks, that's over the age of 21 and, actually makes our team better. All for a reasonable price? Impossible. Can't be us.   Hopefully he can play on the left though, because I'm not sure how else he gets in. And his injury record does concern me, although it'll help him fit right in at Chelsea unfortunately... with Richarlison staying at Spurs, you can see why Neto has chosen Chelsea.   - now, not a guaranteed starter because he sees Kulu and Johnson there. - perceived notion the Kulu plays RW (when in fact Ange is pushing him into a shadow striker) - therefore, I get paid more at Chelsea to be a probable starter, rather than get paid less for a probable starter at Spurs.(most likely)   Spurs get stumped on these targets a lot. I think he's a quality player and Spurs have made a mistake. He is a really good player suited for a 3-4-3 as an inside winger. If he stays fit Chelsea can challenge for top 4. I DONT HAVE ANY MORE DOPAMINE MAKE IT STOP Hello, can any Wolves fan or anyone in the know tell me what to expect and if this is good. Because I haven't watched him closely and from sats of 5/6 games per goal and 3.5 games per assist, it doesn't look that great. Genuinely asking. Thanks. That was quick lol 😂 maybe we sell them Broja the other way lol 😂 they have been interested for time Not past 3 pm in the UK! They're right on time My watch has ended. For today Relax? We are buying players past their prime. A 24yo with no resale value? SMH my head I wonder who they will sign tomorrow How many players have the signed??? Half the squad will be injured by November no worries  They are gonna divide the starting 11 by 3 teams and alternate them every 3 games. Strasbourg is about to get a whole new starting 11 Point of this signing is most likely that they don't have to give Mudryk and Sterling too many minutes lol Yes [removed] People are exaggerating with Chelseas transfers, their actual line-up would be:  Nkunku(Jackson/Omorodion/Guiu)   Sterling(Mudryk)  Palmer  Neto(Madueke)  Lavia(Caicedo)  Enzo(Dewsberry-Hall)  Cucurella(Gusto)  Colwill(Badiashille)  Fofana(Disasi/Tosin)   James(Gusto)  Jorgensen(Sanchez)  Ideally loan out one of Guiu/Omorodion, because they have 3 strikers.   Ideally offload Chalobah because right now they have 5 CB's for 2 spots. But what could also happen is we see Enzo playing a CB as FB in the middle of the season (similar to Pep and Arteta). They already build with 3 at the back with one of the FB playing as a CB.  The rest of the players fill up squad places or are not part of their plans and will be sold/loaned by the end of the market. He’ll be fit for like 15 games anyway. Play 10 wingers and a goalkeeper. In fact just put a winger in goal too. Loan them to us (Manchester United). mudryk or sterling gotta be on the way out Everyone gets a minute each. They been conceding goals like fuck and they buy a winger hahahaha….put your bets on for Maresca to be first manager sacked before Xmas… Many players they currently have will be loaned/sold. This signing was actually important because they had no rotation option for Madueke as RW except an out of position Mudryk. That's the neat part.... Loans, loans, and more loans. They won't/can't and when the manager leaves after 9 months there will be even more players stuck in the Chelsea Limbo. Yes Using the infamous loan army Easy: Jackson gets zero minutes. The bigger question is:  What kind of counseling are these players receiving? These kids are moving to squads with at least 2 to 3 young signings at every position. Why do any think it's a good idea? League and cup squads. 24+palmer each. I don’t think Boehly realizes you can use the same players each.   Why the conference league will have Cold Palmer but the prem squad will have Cole Palmer. Bro what in the fuck are they gonna do??? Are they gonna start a second club and play their way up through the ranks to the Prem?? They can't even register all the players for PL! My guess is that BlueCo is about to buy another club and they're purchasing some of these players in anticipation of ""stocking the shelves."" They've already tried to expand and buy teams in other countries. It's not *just* Strasbourg;  last year, from what I remember, there were rumours of attempted acquisitions for teams in the Eredivisie and South America. They won't lmao.   Actually insane how much they've already spent. They have one outgoing which it T Silva, they already signed 3 players for about 80 mil, now between this and the keeper we are looking at 150 already. Each player gets another player to hop on their shoulders. Bottom player uses his feet and  top player uses his head, so it's not against the rules. No need to look it up. They'll sell players to Saudi You forget - Chelsea aren't a football club anymore, they're an investment fund. If you think of each player signing as an investment from someone who doesn't care about football, it makes more sense.  Couldn't have happened to a more deserving, piss weak, racist club with no real history to speak of. Kevin de Bruyne (back) to Chelsea, here we go! Damn good strategy, buying good player from other clubs so these players wont destroy us anymore, this is what we have done with Cucurella, Caicedo and now Pedro Neto. Also never sell out players to EPL club and just sell to Aletico Madrid, now the strategy makes sense lmao We've got them first game of the season so thanks for that haha Cunha questionable for that game too, so yeah it’ll be quite hard for us to get something out of the game. Although Rodrigo Gomes is looking quite good in pre season. When do we play?  Just wondering if you’re going to wait until January window to sign Antony Scott McTominay to Chelsea here we go Why does Chelsea, the largest team, not simply buy the other teams? Are you forgetting there's a January window? Everyone else is proper shitting themselves over wages/ffp but Chelsea just continue as normal.   Proper weird setup. My sources say Boehly first came to Strasbourg with an offer to buy some players, but they said ""double it and give it to the next club"" Absolutely. Especially left footed attackers who like to play off the right. Real gap there Squad’s been thin ever since the Hazard transfer.  :drumroll: They almost dropped below 45 players, they had to get him in ASAP. I don't know, still feel like there is not enough depth But they will never field 11 keepers if this way. Boehly got confused and has been trying to field enough players for an American football team. Saw that starting 11 and thought they still needed to sign defense and special teams. Serious question, how many players do they currently have?? Good thing they have depth to cover for him Yes we do! So we can sign another injury prone player as his replacement I want to know what going through their mind. 63 mil for a player with his injury record is crazy Injury prone because we need him for the full 90 mins every game when he is fit and he gives his all every game. With Chelsea he will be able to rest which should reduce his injuries. One player will play from Aug-Nov, next will play Nov-Feb and the last will play from Feb-May Maybe the injury prone part is part of their plan to ensure everyone gets minutes?  The plan is simple. Have a squad of 60 super injury prone players and your odds of being able to actually field a team become a lot better. Way fewer performance bonuses paid out as well if every player only plays 120 minutes each The have like 8 players who can play RW, and they’ll all play 4-5 games Don’t worry, only paying him 60m 😂 That sounds even worse than not being able to stay fit, that's more like occasionally taking a break from the physio to kick the ball a bit. Missed over 100 games in the last 4 seasons. Lol what are Chelsea thinking You even missed out the season before. He's played 3000 minutes in the last 3 seasons with just 36 starts from the last 114 PL games.  And that doesn't include the end of the 20/21 season where he missed the last 7 games as well. Just pulled the stats in the five years he’s played in the Prem. Featured in 60% of games in those five seasons. Featured in just 45% of games in the last three seasons.   He was so desperately needed as Wolves struggled to generate an attack so often in those seasons. If he was healthy, he would have played. is he not a right winger? Chelsea best player is also a rw Wait wolves didn't have european football last season  right? So he missed 23 out of 38 league games + cup?   Not able to stay fit is an understatement lol Ha!  Boehly would see that as an opportunity to buy player for low fees and lower salary for 7 years. There is a win somewhere there, which we mere mortals can’t see *""I've just turned up this morning and there are 12 new players. Help.""* Malang Sarr: ""Here we go again"" poch with malang sarr Plus if he's injured he'll have plenty of pals to hang out with in the medical centre! Where did this Neto deal come from? Seemed to materialize out of thin air. Chelsea are about to create 19 more teams and form their own league at this point Rb looking a bit light  How is enzo vice captain of that team lmao 24 players in that image will be first team players this season, adding 3 more players and getting rid of one is a good squad size for a team that could easily play 70 games in the 12 months. 15 of those players will be sold or loaned Mate by Chelsea'a standards he's standing on the edge of the grave And Drake’s standards….allegedly The Dicaprio test [They've sold 100m in transfers so far, and that doesn't include Conor, and only 129m in incomings (that have been officially signed). I'm sure there are 3 or 4 that haven't been added to that total yet.](https://www.transfermarkt.us/fc-chelsea/transfers/verein/631/saison_id/2024)  Plus, the had those sketchy sales of hotels and training grounds and the women's team.    They're probably flying very close to the sun right now. Maatsen, Hutchison, Hall, Gallagher are close to 150M in sales. I need to know this too. They’re already like -£100m in the red playing Conference league this season. This whole system seems so stupid to me. Because they are good at selling.  They offed Mount and Havertz for 100m last year.  This year they've offed hall and Gallagher for 70m and im sure they've made other sales that I can't remember off the top of my head to get them over 100m again. Boehly is worth billions. My question is, how do they comply with FFP? I assume it's because of the length of the contracts and amortization and all that, but who knows? £1.5 billion debt was wiped when the takeover happened which gave them an unfair advantage in PSR compared to everyone else. That and accounting loopholes. The rules are resetting for next season no? If that’s the case I think they’re just saying fuck psr for this season and taking the hit. Those Conference League riches Up until the last few signings (of which it's hard to keep track) we were actually making money this window on sales/signings. And that's not including the Gallagher deal, plus hopefully ones for Chalobah, Broja, Kepa, Lukaku etc. say what you want about us spunking money up the wall, but we sell high too.   Well it's that, and also all the dodgy shit we do with hotels that help ...   (Plus the financial fair play rules being awfully implemented to begin with) Selling Chelsea real estate to boley, they can do what they want. He's good, but that injury history for 60m? Big big risk Who’s injured more often than not Dewsbury Hall is a good player. I think Jorgensen is OK too Oh don't worry, they'll fuck his career up too Every time I watch Wolves he's the danger man. He's got absolutely no desire to use his right foot but it doesn't seem to matter, his left is magic. (Classic left footed player) Not good enough to actually make a change. We have like a dozen of decent wingers already, and we buy ANOTHER instead of actually being a player in a position we need (that isn't a 16-year-old) Just be happy they've gone back to the ""overpaying for promising U-25 player"" strategy. If these clowns spent this 54 million on 3 new Brazilian children with 20 senior apps between them I would've lost it Agreed but 60m is still a very good deal for you guys, especially for an inury prone player Honestly I'm happy with it.   I love Neto, but he's injury prone and £50m is £50m. Hobbs reinvested the Nunes money very well last season, and I'm looking forward to seeing how he can reinvest this money too. They'll basically start every season massively in the red and in need of selling. I'm guessing their plan is that in the short term, their academy keeps producing talents they can sell for pure profit, and in the long term they hope some of these youngsters they bought become world beaters.  It's an insane strategy though and turns a football club into a glorified VC firm rather than something the fans can be proud of. Every single day there is a new player, its beyond ridiculous. You have to ask why players are coming still as well: walking into this bloated sqaud, new manager, conference league European football. From the outside looking in its a mad house Because PSR is a joke. Sell a hotel to yourself and bam, you can buy more players.  Wanting academy talents to stay and develop at their clubs? Nah fuck that, who cares about identity. Sell one academy player and buy 10 foreign youngsters instead!  Or why not sell a player to another club for a made up number while they do the same. Pure profit! Nothing to see here.  There are so many loopholes it might as well not exist for some clubs. Thanks Gwen Stefani. Y'all got any more of those expensive injury-prone wingers It's prime day everyday for chels I don’t recall him having such a big summer window, insane really. Mans going to buy a new yacht when he's done. Not a bad strategy, to be honest. Buy all the players. All of them. Then, when in 6 months you hire your new manager, they can just pick the players that fit their style and play those! No more worries about the manager having to adjust their style to players available to them, or about having to bring new faces in, they'll already be there! LW probably cos Sterling is so far over the hill and Mudryk is Mudryk I swear the manager has no say in the transfers. I thought this a year ago but it's absolutely apparent now: they are run by a private equity fund and they are borrowing their transfer strategy from the type of ""diversification"" thats preached in finance  The idea is you don't rely too heavily on getting every single decision right. Instead, you make many bets to maximize your chances of hitting on a few of them (and so that no single investment is crucial to your success)  They're also banking on the fact that there's so much money in football that they can offload failed transfers without incurring total losses.  It might be nuts, but this is the kind of shit I saw in my investment banking days. Finance bros with MBAs trying to apply their theories to everything. i think the plan is this; just buy a load of random players, incurring massive losses, and hope that somehow your championship manager can miraculously make them compete in the worlds most competitive league before being sacked in 10 months I thought your lot were in for him, what happened to that? Palmer will probably play more central so we only have Noni as a RW That is the plan apparently, to get different profiles of players to give the manager a lot of flexibility and options. Yeah wish that was how it worked. All new 4-4-9 formation. Random number generator  Neto on the left, Palmer on the right, Nkunku in the middle and Jackson/Osimhen upfront depending on how this transfer shapes up I guess.              Jackson     Neto - Nkunku - Enzo - Palmer        Caicedo/Lavia - Gusto      Cucurella Colwill Fofana  First game of the season since Reece is banned. Yes Huge if given his history That’s a big big if. Wolves making a tidy profit along with their Killman sale, their PSR should be very healthy now.   A win for Wolves but seriously Chelsea how the fuck you going to play ALL these wingers? You needed a striker right? Save that money for Oshimen? Just a thought. 24 year winger with 2 goals and 9 assists last season and big injury record for 60 mil is not bad? You give that money to Beppe Marotta and he makes a squad competing for the title in a year. This guy is not even guaranteed to bench the bastion of players they have already. That seems unlikely: https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/pedro-neto/verletzungen/spieler/487465   According to that he has missed 126 games in the last 6 years Narrator: he can’t Well I don't know about that, but I read from multiple sources that he was available for around 45 pounds (because of the injury record) . Wouldn't surprise me Chelsea offered 60 as the opening bid. Better wages + you don’t become a top tier professional athlete without a bit of an ego so you’re not worried about squad size because you believe you’ll show your good enough to play every week Because many of those players will be gone in a few weeks. Amazing to me how people actually fall for clickbait posts that have Lukaku, Anjorin, and a bunch of academy players in a 24/25 squad. There will be a lot of games to go around. Deep cup runs, conference league, and club world cup. If you’re being offered triple or even quadruple your wages on a 7 year deal, you’d probably be a lot easier to convince With lots of zeros behind the first number on the cheque. I guess Mendes is the one deciding and his players  (except the superstars) have absolutely no say in where they go… Money!  They pay great wages  - Premier League  - London  - Big club  - Long contracts  - club will let players leave if they want to for the right price, we talent horde but we dont hold on too long.  - odds are professional footballers back themselves to think they can make the first team or at the very least get minutes. They'll run out of hotels and training grounds to sell soon. [They've sold 100m in transfers so far, and that doesn't include Conor, and only 128m in incomings (that have been officially signed). I'm sure there are 3 or 4 that haven't been added to that total yet.](https://www.transfermarkt.us/fc-chelsea/transfers/verein/631/saison_id/2024)  Plus, the had those sketchy sales of hotels and training grounds and the women's team.    They're probably flying very close to the sun right now. Amortisation and selling hotels! selling academy products is huge for FFP. FFP is a very dumb system You see we also sell players What’s your manager done? You know that shiny new LB you guys recently bought? > A £60m player whos on a 5 years contract would be a £12m a year cost on the books,   but 5 £60 million players over 5 years is 60 mil a year for 5 years :D Ornstein hitting us like an RKO. A unique player for every week 😂😂 Yes. He plays both sides if my googling is right. Clearlake are selling academy players for 100% profit. They know what they’re doing, I don’t think they’ll be sanctioned but I think the PL will rewrite the laws on this sort of spending loophole [deleted] That would be true if PSR wasn't an absolute joke that makes no sense. All the young players they routinely buying are not cheap. They cost at least 20 million per player. I don't know if those young players they bought don't live up to their potential and they can't get much money from them. If there's anything you can count on for an American super corporation it's knowing financial loopholes. The fact people go to university for 4 years just to learn one part of the tax code is all you need to know. Even after they graduate they still gotta get their license to do taxes [deleted] I'm convinced that every year like 30 players just spawn out of nowhere in their squad. They have 7 goalkeepers, 14 black defenders, 18 wonderkid midfielders and like 7 attackers, 4 of which are either constantly injured or on loan in Strasbourg. Looks like it, wouldn’t be shocked if we loan him maybe not this season but he has been a flop unfortunately Maybe they'll use villa for a bit to give you guys a break Half a season would be a blessing for him. Apparently he's only been available for 27% of the games while at Wolves. Problem is his injury history. Lot of money for someone who’s only available like 30% of your games Have you taken into consideration his football ability That's insane. Didn't know he was so unproductive. Now watch us offer him 150k+ salary and then say, we walked away from Olise bacuse he was too expensive. I'd have absolutely loved Neto with us,  hopefully it doesn't work out for them haha. A little jealous ngl. It's definitely a risk but when fit Neto would probably start for any Prem team on that left hand side. Also he'd go for more than 60m if his fitness wasn't in question. He’s unreal you’re smoking craic Sold 100mil worth of players (just Maatsen, Hall, and Hutchinson). Plus the sale of hotel/training grounds with whatever years they are added to. > what is their strategy here?  That implies they have one People talk about Oil clubs but Chelsea is causing way more damage to the sport than PSG or City ever did. They snap up every talented youngster, have zero plans for their development except sending them on loan to Strasbourg, and do not have any plans to give them consistent minutes to improve because they’ll sign someone else in the same position.   They’re literally destroying the next generation of football players.  This is a signing that doesn’t come into that category but like you said, someone needs to intervene and stop this. I say send him to any bundesliga team. Maybe Dortmund and see if someone bites after a (hopefully) decent season there It does. Chelsea's sold like 100mil worth already (Hall, Maatsen, Hutchinson). This doesn't even include Gallagher or Chalobah or Broja. Plus any others they might do (like Lukaku off the wage book or potentially Chilwell).  Ziyech, Sarr, and Silva are also off the squad with their wages too. IF he stays healthy, I think it’s a fantastic signing. But it’s a massive ‘If’ Chelsea's wage bill is actually not that bad. Sterling/Chilwell are the two anomalies before the new wage structure was in place (Lukaku too, but very heavily being pushed to leave). The wage build has been cut by 25-30% yearly ""We need a Boehly 737 to fit our squad.""  Fixed it for you. 250 a year or so  If you are talking about player amortization Chelsea is profitable and is generating cash flow with their sales needed a chaperone Boehly has nothing to do with transfers or contracts and hasn’t for some time. Try to keep up. What are all the lads for winger? Currently we have Sterling, Mudryk, Madueke.  Then we have Palmer and Nkunku that can be wingers or attacking mids. Neto makes 6 for 2 wing spots and an attacking mid.   Then Jackson can cover wing (if needed). KdH and Carney can cover attacking mid. 5 subs. Euro conference. And prior seasons of dealing with a lot of injuries. he scored 8 goals in the past 4 years, that's pretty bad Everton and Forest should simply just make more money. 60 million for a player that is starting less than half the games every season is a lot of money. There's a reason Arsenal and Spurs didn't pursuit it. His talent is undeniable. As much as his unavailability. He would have started above kulu and johnson without a doubt I think he has chosen Chelsea because Levy is cheap and never actually was in for Neto seriously With what defense And also they have made 2 today. Signed another GK right before this. Shake my head my head Gabriel Mec Yes And the rest will be at Strasbourg. And Neto will be one of them sadly Neto certainly will be. Love the player, wanted him at Arsenal once upon a time, but not his injury record. Tbf having the most amount of injuries is quite likely when you also have easily the most number of players >Half the squad will be injured by November no worries    Which begs the question why Man Utd ain't doing the same. Wouldn’t Neto fit right in then? The other 2 teams can play each other. Problem solved. Aaah, so my FIFA manager mode strategy. Alter eating every game would be better, then they play 1, miss 2nd and 3rd game and play 4th. /s My Dream League Soccer tactic Strasbourg board celebrating everytime Chelsea sign another player What's happening to Strasbourg, is it the new Vitesse? “Let’s buy a 60m player so we don’t have to play two other players that cost 110m” Imagine spending 150m on 2 player and needing to buy new players because you don't want them to play too many minutes. I have a feeling this means one of those two will be sold. My guess it’s Sterling since his wages are so high. Neto also missed half the season… Neto gets a lot of assists though.  Ok so from this you've left out  Lukaku  Broja  Angelo  Fofana  Deivid  Moreira  Casadei  Chukwuemeka  Ugochokwu  Veiga  Kepa  Petrovic  Bergstrom  Bettinelli Operation talent drain [it's working](https://i.imgur.com/rpnuBC1.png) I feel like we can always be a bit confident playing Chelsea these days. We've lost only once in our last 8 games against them (4 wins), won the last 3 with Hwang/Neto missing     We've beat them twice with Diego Costa and Fabio Silva upfront for  fuck's sake    The football gods have given us their number, to keep indefinitely based on that personally i cannot wait for full time wolves 4-0 chelsea after we draw against city playing good in the first game     as is tradition at this point I've just been told by the board that we will only move for Antony in the January window if our game in November results in a draw or loss, no chance of signing the Brazilian during this window as things stand. It actually doesn't make sense. How are they doing this?? to be fair they have been selling A LOT and their debt was completely wiped prior to the takeover, which goes a long long way... plus FFP only really kicks in after 3 seasons and this is Chelsea's 3rd full season under new management  I think we MIGHT be seeing a regression to mean from next summer going forward but at this point who knows Boom. Roasted. Who are also injury prone Infinite player glitch Cocaine Reece James wanted a friend. Mad bastards will be in for Naby Keita at this rate Maybe if he's a luxury player, they just want the upside while he's healthy.  I hate that idea though. > He was so desperately needed as Wolves struggled to generate an attack so often in those seasons. If he was healthy, he would have played.  I think that was part of the issue though. He's an incredible player so we'd get him back into the squad as quickly as we could and play him as regularly as we could.   Chelsea will be able to manage his minutes a little more, hopefully keeping him fit. Neto has played more games on the left than he's played on the right. Palmer will play as the 10 in Enzo's system, the wingers stay wide and hes much better playing centrally. No rumours at all. Very weird transfer. Right? I opened reddit and thought it was a joke Wolves are really good at keeping things under wraps, generally we get no rumors Its nice getting a truly out of nowhere transfer BOMBA for once! I've gotten so sick of seeing hourly updates from Here We Go Man and the rest Chelsea probably made a decision quickly, came in with a fair offer and Wolves accepted straight away. Todd got him on career mode and pulled the trigger. The first squad picture of the season will have to be an Arial shot with a drone. Cobham Cup Their AAA affiliate team is about to boss the Minor Leagues this year League gets canceled cause all of them are injured at the same time. Let's not kid ourselves. By Chelsea's standards, and Neto's injury history, he's not standing. He's in a wheelchair. Can you even fly if you're carrying so much baggage? These incomings doesn't count players like Estevan and Paez, both being fairly expensive The wage bill must be absolutely astronomical at this stage. That’s just transfer fees, what about wages for their 72 players Personally I think the plan is to fly close to the sun. This [comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1enxonl/comment/lh9usdk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)expanded on my point with more detail than I had What this doesn’t account for is the amortized fees from the last two seasons are continuous… and after all they’ve spent it’s like 150 million every year they have to make up for in sales… that number will increase as they only sell academy players… next summer it will be like 190 million in amortized fees they have to dig themselves out of… Yeh but how many millions of installements do they owe every year from previous transfers?   Literally all chelsea fans ever say is “yeah we’ve spent X millions but we’re only paying X/5 million per year”. Well now is that year where they should all add up. Yes but it’s about the building yearly hit on the books. Since fixed assets like this as recognized over the span of their useful life, the yearly hit on the books is adding up.  Assuming they’re paying for all players with even payments split over 7 years for the last two windows, and 5 years for this window, they’re yearly hit on the books per year for the last 3 seasons is around 190M/ year.   That number keeps growing and will be harder to keep kicking the can on Selling Gallagher gives them a lot of leeway since he is academy/100% profit. Tebas wouldve lost his mind if they were in La Liga. Maatsen for another £35mil and Omori Hutchinson too If you look at my comment below, they’re still around 600m in the red over the past three seasons  They’re incredible at selling unwanted players but their spending is absolutely ludicrous Maatsen and Hutchinson brought in additional 55M. That’s obviously what I’m saying lol  Chelsea fans will say they’re good at selling, which is true, and they’re good at producing homegrown players to sell, also true, but at some point there’s got to be a limit right? They’re £250m in the hole from last season, £400m the one before that, and then they’ll be a good 60/70m in the red this season if they buy Neto and there’s still apparently more to come   It’s absolutely insane We sell hotels Length of contract been capped.  Selling home grown+ car park has helped.  We will see this year if they sell stadium to themselves or something Next summer they will sell Colwill and Reece James for pure profit to make sure to comply with FFP so they can continue to overspend on random players and moan they are forced into having to sell their academy guys Well they sell hotels and land to their other entities so they’ve got that going for them Some mixture of amortisation and pure profit sales , this summer they’ve sold Gallagher and Hutchinson for about 70 mil of pure profit   Chalobah should also be leaving and big earners like lukaku and kepa should also leave , all in all they’re at least breaking even if not in the green They don't. Ridiculous theory. Debt interest/repayments is not included in FFP. 60m euros tbf but still a lot of dough He's more than good shouldn't be throwing stones in glass houses my friend Look who’s talking 😂😂😂 Let other fanbase banter us on that lmao I love when Man U fans don’t see any irony to their comments. I think in this case his hamstrings will do that for him sadly. Laughs in Sancho Well, we literally just signed a 19 year old Belgian keeper, does that count? We are branching out to other South American countries too, don’t worry. It's the same with us and Dani Olmo, fantastic player that you don't really want to let go but he gets injured a lot. theyve spent more than a billion and somehow dont seem to have improved whatsoever. its mind boggling how far theyve gone committing to this crackpot scheme with less than nothing to show for it American capitalist ideas are crushing football. If you’re American and this offends you, then feel free to aim this criticism at capitalist writ large. But American sports influence, with their giant arenas replacing actual football grounds, and ownership groups have had an undeniable influence.   Glazers came in with leveraged buy and have been sucking the club dry like leaches. This Clearlake clown operation has completely distorted Chelsea, they’re an unrecognizable club from a few years ago.     The obscenely rich oligarchs used to use football clubs as a safe place to put money out of reach of autocrats and as vanity projects. Now, they’re turning football clubs into VC ventures, or using them to white wash their politics/image.       It’s all so completely fucked. This greedy, broken system leaves nothing to be enjoyed. If the sun shines on it, sooner than later a grubby greedy little shite with already far more wealth than they’ll ever need will find a way to corrupt it, and suck it dry of any good it had in it.  Before they were a Russian oligarchs unprecedented play thing/money and reputation laundry, and before that the go to spot for BNP leaflets and approving chants on captain's whiteness -- whatever misguided pride?  Ah, but they did have it in all that -- good riddance indeed Correct. They have to make up for like 140-150 million in amortized yea after fees every fiscal year. A number which will be going up after this summer and winter window to like 190. It will hold there as they most likely will not sell anyone but academy players next summer. Real life Football Manager is a 24/7 life for them. I don't know what they re smoking. Aren’t you supposed to have 54 players on your team? Chelsea dir of football at the office: ""Hey! The new guy likes center backs that can carry the ball forward out of a back 3, we got anything?""  Chelsea assistant down the hall in a closet dusting off old players: ""Yea got a pair, but they haven't been used since 2022.""  DoF: ""Ahh that'll do. Clean em up and throw em outside for training in an hour."" Clearly doesn't This was made clear when the job title at Chelsea became “head coach” and not manager.  Managers rarely do, we aren't ik the 90s Nope. The manager shouldn't have a say.  Allowing the manager a voice in transfers is how you end up with completely different styles when one manager leaves and another comes in. he's a ""yes man"" by the looks of it I don’t think spurs wanted to pay the fee and offered a player plus cash and wolves said fuck off which is fair If Palmer goes central what happens to nkunku? Did they sign you too? Winston Bogarde showed us it was possible. Best hustler in the game. Big big big if if true  *taps head* Osimhen's wage demands are 400k/week. That's 20 million per year. In the world of Boehlynomics, that 20 million is the annual amortization value of 100 million spread over 5 years. Might as well spend that on a younger promising striker on low wages. We can't sign Osimhen in our current wage structure anyway. 2 goals and 9 assists in 20 games averaging 75 mins a game whild playing for wolves is good For a good example James Maddison played more games and minutes than Neto and has the same number of assists. Shitting on Neto stat wise is not well thought out. [deleted] When they bought the club they talked about a 4-window plan of mass spending. This is the 4th window so I imagine things will slow down a lot going forward....I hope The problem with Boehlyism is you eventually run out of hotels and training grounds to sell. You can’t sell Hotels, Women’s teams, and training grounds every year though. Theyre just one time Get-Out-of-Jail-Free cards It seems like they’re betting on just being able to continue to sell and churn, churn every season.  It’s risky but kind of fascinating  That is true but it's more players for the 60 I guess 😂 So 60m for an injury prone player who will be played out of position He was way more dangerous on the right Thing is that it's not really a loophole.  They buy players and amortise their cost over 5 years, with extra amortisation against them from previous years.  They sell academy players for profit this year. Next year they need to be able to sell more players just to match the amortisation they've built up already, and the year after that, and the year after that.  Their ability to develop and then sell players is what they're relying on and unless they want to get into dodgy territory (which tbf they already have with hotels etc)  they are basically committed to having to sell players for years now with the additional restriction that players they've bought in might not be financially viable to sell. I do wonder what the plan will be when the stricter loan regulations come into play. Doesn't exactly help build transfer value to have players absolutely nowhere near first team football and even youth squads will be absolutely saturated now.   Wouldn't be surprised to see them organising friendlies throughout the season soon to keep the players not in the squad more visible to the market. But the other sanctions will absolutely ruin them. It's fine receiving a 10 or deduction if you're City, Arsenal or even Liverpool over the last few seasons, but Chelsea aren't even reaching their goal of the Champions League without it.  They'd need to hit 80 pts to potentially be safe with a deduction of that size and even then that's not a guarantee given 5th placed teams have hit 70 before.  I honestly don't see what their plan is. You can get around things so far, but selling your best academy players and banking on youngsters to come good is so volatile. Nevermind the fact you will eventually end up running out of hotels to sell. You can't sell the stadium to yourself either as I don't think the club actually own it? Isnt Boehly worth billions. I dont think he particularly cares Wtf was the point of saying 14 black defenders? > 14 black defenders  ??? Loaning him won't mean much, he still has around 7 years of contract left... So if he was fit the entire season hed be worth like 240m. What a steal from Chelsea! Ah you never know once a player switches clubs if the injuries will be as prevalent as they were before.   It's not like Chelsea have been cautious with their money either so if it turns out to be a flop then they'll just go again. I fully believe that the prem isn't going to do a thing to them because Chelsea know their limitations and they've not hit it. sorry we don't actually ""scout"" here, we just look at their wikipedia career statistics page and then feel good enough to make conclusions off it Football ability isn't much good on the physio table The best ability is availability Availability>Ability, but Neto is worth it if he’s playing Wilshere had plenty of ability as well. And he's been retired for years now (he's 32). Injuries add up.... Talent is not worth much if the player can't physically play. Ngl I'm slightly jealous that he's gone to Chelsea cause he is super talented but also not that worried because of his injury record. 1. Scoring 11 goals is part of his ability don’t think Chelsea are signing him to not score at all   2. He hardly plays Don't listen to that moron. He had 9 assists in 18 starts last season. What ? Arsenal has such a good squad with good system, why would you be jealous of us ? Neto is just one of a million signing from us, you should be worried with the amount of players we have in case some guys flop, the concern is that if someone flops we always have someone else to replace hahahahahah Neto’s record on the left   44 games 5 goals 6 assists hardly inspired.  He might be his fitness is in question But…it is in question. It’s not like he had one long injury stint, it’s been a pattern. Yes, because the premiere league aint full of those players?  We have done it for 15 years, city and all other try to do it now. He'll buy them beer. I have one American backup keeper you can have for the low low price of 40 million quid, barely used Yeah, his injury record is the one (large) red flag. Guess we're confident we can sort it out. As you say, he's undeniably a great player if he can stay fit.   Though 'if he can stay fit' is the caveat to pretty much our entire squad at the minute I agree, but it's an easier sell to Neto if Richarlison would have left.   We're on: Richy, Solanke, Son/Kulu (ST), Kulu, Johnson (RW), Son and Werner (LW).   If I was Neto, I know Kulu is a sicko for running and a fucking brilliant player. I'd rather get paid 50,000 more to sit at Chelsea and compete with Madueke that is streaky asf. If Richy had gone and Ange had given assurances, he would have come, Richy said 'no'.   So we have a guy that's scored 12/60, injured throughout here, struggled with off-the-pitch issues, and hasn't really showed consistent quality in our team. It's all too and well, not turning up for work in the office for a yearl, but then crying 'I'm home'. But no, we need an RW, Kulu and Johnson are in that position, Kulu can't be moved to ST/SS without Richy moving on. We've let this one slip big time. Oh thank god, they really needed more keeper depth. 7 just wasn't enough Are Chelski building like 3 football teams or what.. so many signings.. or do they have so much money that they feel like using it just for the sake of it. No fucking wonder they had to buy a hotel It's like London buses    So they don't have to sign someone tomorrow? There's no way😭 If they don't get any minutes Chelsea is ending up in Haag instead You can only loan out so many over 21s, so not sure what they're gonna do Him and Reece James together on the right flank are a match made in heaven.  They'll be class for the 3 matches a season that they're both fit for. Chelsea see injury records as a challenge. They have different strategy. They'll sign a player who is 34+ & is backup to the backup and then they'll tell him that you'll be starting every single game from now on. That way you’re guaranteed at least two points every round. Jokes on you it’s the same people 'I can't believe PSR made us sell Gallagher' it’s actually crazy how low the expectations for them are. you’ll have chelsea fans defend coming 6th last season when they should be expected to at least challenge for the league. Don't worry about it. I'm sure it makes sense for someone with a big brain, but we common folks who use *common sense* will never understand this. Mudryk and Sterling combined was surely way more than 110m no? Any other club would be slaughtered for this, for Chelsea it's just normal apparently. They should be fighting for the league with how they have spent the last few years. Who’re also under contract for the next 5 years so who aren’t going anywhere. Galaxy fucking brain from Chelsea Isn’t it 140 mil? Saying this like we shouldn't upgrading purely on the fact they cost money.  A player should never get minutes based on value lol Mudryk was such a stupid signing from day one. I can't fathom how anyone was willing to pay more than £30m for him. Who cost 150m? Wait a minute ive seen this one before I'd hope so, but I also assumed Kepa and Lukaku would have been sold by now and here we are with them still on the books.  We're signing new players, but *really* need to sell some of the ones we don't  want. Who will buy him. Same problem with all the UTD cast offs? So they added another player with an history of injuries to a squad that already has that problem? Yeah those are the players that fill out the rest of squad spots that I said that were relatively cheap and some are not part of their plans and will be sold or loaned by the end of the market. Yes this is exactly how it works lmao, I notice how Brighton is clear declining after we bought Caicedo. However, even though this is beneficial to Chelsea, I find it unfair for other clubs. Of course as a Chelsea fan, I would want Pedro Neto to be here but I feel it is so unfair for other clubs Thanks mate, you've just jinxed it Charity FC Baby 💪  We either dominate but don't capitalise, so don't win, or we play like shit. There is no alternative I don’t think that’ll be a problem Our net spend this window before buying Neto was -£2m. And we still intend to sell Lukaku, Chalobah, Broja, Datro Fofana, Kepa, etc. https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Faoouay8z6hhd1.jpeg&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=Gunners&utm_content=t1_lhby1p6 Because clubs keep bailing them out like United with Mount and now Villa, Ipswich and Newcastle You're right, might as well buy another winger just in case Don't worry I'm sure their injuries will line up perfectly It's the Russian way of solving problems - throw bodies at the problem. Instead of having two available guys, have four injury prone dudes.  Abramovic would be proud. Wise move. Managers don't have to worry about player rotation. Collect injury prone players.  And play them alternate so they dont get injured.   Or well, all of them gets injured at the same time, and Chelsea sign another 5 backup in the January window. Good thing they have depth to cover for them It’s like The Simpsons cursed frogurt meme Are they really? What's Thiago at these days? so then Nkunku? just benched? Weird? This is how transfers should be done. yeah it was like that when liverpool signed jota from wolves, there was nothing and then boom ornstein and joyce tweet and he’s holding up the shirt a few minutes later We get a lot of fake rumors. The real ones happen very quickly and people like Fabrizio ramano are not the first to post about it Oh Lord. I love the banter. This was good. Buy a bigger plane. Or throw some of your other passengers off the plane... *cough* **Conor** *cough* Those don’t count for this transfer window.  I believe they’re counted in next summers transfer window 17m pounds for Paez. Estevao is the expensive one at ~30m Nah, it's pretty low. They have a shit ton of players on some minimum wage 8 year bs deal looks like. I can only see 2 or 3 in that whole squad being worthy of a first team salary. Neto, Sterling and maybe.. well I can't think of anyone else worth big money.  They sold hotels, parking lots and the Chelsea W teams to their parent company I guess. Revenue  It doesn't matter as long as you are selling players every window, especially home grown players who entire sale hits the book immediately. Our amortisation cost (or yearly hit as you’ve described it) for was £205m as per the latest accounts.   It’s only going to have gone up from there.   Which means we have a yearly expenditure of 200m amortisation + 200-300m in wages + any other costs (we spent 75m on agent fees last accounts)   £500m+ of yearly costs against a revenue of £500m (which has been boosted by player sales and infrastructure ‘sales’) doesn’t seem like a healthy situation for a club to be in They're still on a pretty big deficit and if you sum up the last two transfer windows they must be getting dangerously close to -800 or 900M.   It's madness, I don't know how this is allowed. For now, yes, but not next year or the one after ... etc ... for 5 years+ They don't need to break even.   The owners are pouring money into the club. The sales give them enough to keep in line with FFP.   If you look at the % of spending to sales clubs like arsenal and United are just as bad. Chelsea are just doing more of it so the total numbers look much worse.  Having 400m in sales and spending 1B puts you at 600m in the red.  That's no different than 40m in sales and spending 100m, that puts you at 60m in the red but the %s are the same for FFP.  (Obviously these are generalizations)  The big negative totals aren't what matters. If there's anything we've learned from Boehly and co that they're good at, it's finding loopholes that can be exploited. No matter how risky it actually is, if they see something that is in any way loosely covered or doesn't cover a specific use case, they will exploit it The rules don't matter. They've sold the women's team, Cobham and the hotels to themselves. There's another trick somewhere.   Maybe part of the stadium, maybe they'll sell some kind of sponsorship infrastructure to themselves. Maybe they'll just take a point deduction. Obviously they're not concerned with it, so there's clearly a trick. You think this is insane? Wait until we buy another 150m of kids in January “balanced” by selling 1 Tyrique George for 20m lmaooo we are absolutely scamming the system somehow, not even the finest Reddit accountants could possibly explain this level of spending This window we've spent ~£110mil and garnered about that in player sales..  And because of the way Amortisation works, this year we've effectively spent £22mil on players and will spend £22mil over the next five years. Plus *far* lower wages than we had (another £50mil a year saved from two years ago).  It's kicking the can down the road a bit, but *surely* they'll stop this mad hoarding of players at some point  and then the idea is they'll have a load of players to sell and have so many that they won't need to rebuild the entire squad for a while either, just a player or two when needed.  It's a long-term strategy that they're speedrunning the start of (in the same way they replaced all but Chilwell and James from their squad in two years and shouldn't need many major signings again) but we'll see how effective it is. To yourselves.  Infinite loop glitch. With all due respect to Reece James, because he is so talented, but who would want to spend an absurd amount for him?  He’s already a Chelsea player, too. Seems that narrows his market. Couldn't the Premier League do away with this ""pure profit"" nonsense or is that just more of a worldwide accounting thing? Getting sick of hearing about it. Yeah, this is not how lol  They sold carparks, hotels and the women’s team to themselves. >should   Ive been hearing this about kepa for the last 5 years. It's an equity contribution by the owner which by the current rules is limited at £90m over three years in PSR. You can make pizza, bread, pasta, naan. Anything with that much dough. Manu doesn’t fuck up good players tho, they just buy bad players I mean both clubs have new ownership, and the worst indictment you can give is that the new Chelsea seem like the old United.  Great signing, if I trusted Chelsea to develop and use their players properly. I didn't say we don't do that 😭 I assume you didn't read my other reply then? In fairness, his attitude's been poor. Someone like Falcao or Van De Beek would be better examples I'd argue that they've spent £1.2bn and arguably have a worse squad than they did before. Well its been a massive failure so far. Its not like other clubs want to copy chelseas ridiculous mismanagment since the takeover so i think the talk of them ruining football is a bit overblown. That said i think if this strategy somehow ends up being successfull that would be a disaster for football  Other teams are laughing to the bank selling randim teenagers to chelsea while they reinvest into their own clubs Chelsea is basically a fully stocked Subway at this point where you can build your own team based on your preferences. The players bought should still fit in the managers style tho. The only reason that wouldn't be the case was if you were sacking the manager Idk maybe on the bench I think he may play as a 9 and Jackson as LW but honestly fuck knows. Just trying to make this make sense  Or Neto plays on the left while we figure out what to do with mudryk he actually shows up in training. Is there any truth to the Osimhen, Lukaku swap? Heard Conte is very keen on Lukaku. Mind you these are all rumours and quite frankly, the Oshimen demands have priced him out of the market for sure. Its not bad, but for 60 mil?   Roma bought Dovbyk and Soule who had 24/8 g/a and 11/3 g/a at Girona and Frosinone for around 60/65mil in total [deleted] I wouldnt buy Maddison for 60 million either.  Im not shitting on him, just saying for this money its hardly good business. > Except Chelsea have completely overhauled the wage structure under Roman.   These younger 'potential' players are probably going from 10k a week to 40-50-60k a week. Not huge wages but when there's 25 of them it all adds up. Neto was only on 50k a week at Wolves, tripling it wouldn’t have even come close to any of the aboves demands I'd be totally stunned if they stopped spending lol. They've changed plan about 5 times already since getting in > You can’t sell Hotels, Women’s teams, and training grounds every year though  Not with that attitude Just buy a new hotel and sell it to themselves for double the price. Problem solved, money for their 9th GK secured. Just buy hotels like players and sell later duh. Infinite money glitch. I assume Eggball's strategy would be to start selling off some of these young assets he's acquiring in order to buy more young assets. In theory you don't need a massive injection of cash  besides at the start as you have assets (players) on the book you can fleece in the future and tick over from there. I read that they’ve basically sold them to themselves and given themselves a management contract so they don’t miss out on the income, so shady that it’s genius. Dont worry, the people who own you will be there to grossly overspend on ageing Chelsea players However, he can and also plays down the left. Overall agree with you. Awful fitness record, high signing fee, already bloated squad, and already 2 existing players in each position he might play. Selling real estate to an entity also owned by you definitely feels  like a loophole. Champions League or bust, essentially. That income is basically the minimum they'll need to comply. [deleted] [deleted] You think even the richest person in the world wont care about their multi billion dollar asset? Lmao Because there are like 14 black defenders, that's just facts. Can't name half of them, constantly injured or loaned out. But at least there’s a chance for him to play consistently and maybe even develop  He could have been a good player imo, but chose the wrong club I am saying to loan him to build up his value a bit Agree, I’m happy we didn’t pull the trigger because, while we’re not short of cash, we don’t take the same gambles Chelsea does. Just playing the odds, I’m glad we steered clear of his injury history. I think Neto is a solid player and worth the price if he wasn't injured constantly Kante barely played major football for two years then casually walsed into the Euros and saved your boy from a Gerrard 2014 moment.  Ability > anything else. He'll rotate at Chelsea, I wouldn't be surprised if his injury record improves  O'Neil admitted to starting Neto despite knowing he wasn't 100% when he did his hamstring, that won't happen at Chelsea (I hope) He has 19 assists in total in the prem last season was a fluke I'm not saying im jealous of you as a team or a club or squad haha. Just of signing Neto. If he stays injury free, ofc a big if, that is a phenomenal talent right there. A GK getting put up for sale is like putting out the bat signal for Paul Winstanley and Behdad Egbhali Is Madueke out going? Because he's surely not starting over Neto. It's all part of the Grand Plan to field 11 GK's at the same time.  Just need 3 more You're gonna look really silly if 6 of their keepers get injured now Is that where Ten Hag is from? Good thing they're all 19 then lmao the rest either get domestic loans or are sold 6 per team I believe. 90 games a season. just need 30 players on every position and you good They should be looking to spend 20 mil on a top class physio instead of the goalkeer hoarding. Records are made to be broken! We’re suffering out here…let us have our small “victories” such as the finished 6th last season trophy That's because there's a big difference between delusionally expecting something and actually looking at the reality and setting normal expectations. Sure with the money spent Chelsea should be challenging but the reality is that the majority of the money has been wasted on youth players or inexperienced players that don't actually improve the team.   The owners/sporting directors deserve to be criticized as much as possible for what they've done, but ultimately the fans can only base their expectations on the quality of the players. I don't think anyone, not even just Chelsea fans are going to look at the best 11 and expect them to be better than Man City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man Utd, etc. Not a single real person expects chelsea would challenge for the league No one expected Chelsea to challenge for the league year one. City is just too well oiled.  But yea you'd think there would be more progress given the money they have spent. If you strip away the money the spend and look at their squad, I’d say 5th-7th is right where they should be. Which is worse. We should, but anyone with any semblance of ball knowledge knows we sure as hell won't be. Money doesn't buy quality, proper scouting does. The players they're signing are good but I don't think anyone of them is world class or close to it, their strategy is flabbergasting. I mean looking at the squad that actually played most games it could've been a lot worse than 6th. Despite all that spending they played basically a mid table squad. They wouldn't have been challenging for the league even if fully healthy. Yeah man no one’s said a word about Chelsea’s spending ay fucking lol Not including the add-ons for Mudryk, yeah £110m is fairly accurate. No chance he’s activated any of the £30m bonuses yet. But yeah ridiculous spending anyway Was about £110m. Rest of mudryk fee was add-ons for PL and CL wins. Mudryk I believe was also 60 million pounds (with a bunch of ad ons he won't reach at this point) and Sterling can't have been 50 million right?.....right? I don't think you visit this sub often because yes, Chelsea get slaughtered a fair bit. Really. They spent horribly. Maybe this will be a good signing Chelsea are slaughtering themselves with this  This kind of shopping spree worked well when Roman took over, now we get the chance to see what happens if it doesn’t they said ""spending 150m on 2 players"". Not on 150m on players twice.  And theres about 35 combinations of chelsea players whose price adds up to 150+m Mudryk + Sterling I think we will get bailed out by SA again. Sounds like a solid strategy if they all get injured at different times Mate that's just under 400 million Euro's worth of player right there that you've left off. I agree. I would hate it if you bought Aaron Ramsdale from us for 40m, please don't do that... so unfair That's true if we only look at it from this window. But over the past 3 seasons, chelsea spent north of a billion Could they not try playing one of their goalkeepers on the wing? If it fails, they can just try another one. Boehly just found another £100 million in his couch cushions Enzo has come out and said that Nkunku can play as an 8, 9, 10 and even on the wings. We havent seen both Palmer and Nkunku playing yet in this system, but im assuming Palmer will most likely be the 10, which ideally would make Nkunku the 9. If any of Jackson/Guiu/Omorodion play then Nkunku can play as the 8 that drifts up or as a winger.   Personally I think Nkunku 9 and Palmer 10 will be how they begin the season considering Jackson is injured. Neto, Samu, and that other keeper you're about to sign will bring it over €250m spent, which is mad considering Neto is probably the only player from that who most people have even heard of. So i expect you'll spend less next summer? Or in the next summer you'll kick the can down the road once again and just spread the cost once again   Creative accounting is a stain on society, spending money that doesn't exist I'd imagine Enzo, caicedo, Chilwell and James on big salaries too, before we even touch on Lukaku and Kepa etc Palmer tbf, probably Nkunku if he returns to german form. What are they going to do? Transfer ban us? Good. Actually, I'm hoping they do :| Surely you can't just expect to sell talents from the academy for that much money every year for the next seven years. This just seems like a recipe for disaster with just one window without outgoings could totally cripple you. And if some of the incommings don't work out it will be hard to replace them It's not allowed though.  Unfortunately there's nothing in football to stop dumb people doing dumb things until they've done them. Not how it works. Gotta amortize those transfer fees my friend. This is the thing that most people miss. It's not necessarily this year that is the problem. It is when they are carrying 350 million in amortisation every year and all the academy sales fall out of the 3 year window. They have to keep selling massively every year at a book profit to cover the amortised purchases. If they aren't able to flip a large amount of their purchases for big profits they could be in a lot of trouble unless the academy pumps obscene levels of players. Right now they have gone through about 6 years worth of academy graduates in 2 years. > The sales give them enough to keep in line with FFP  …. Except they haven’t?   Last accounting period we were around 70m over the allowable loss limit. The period before that we were about 40m over it.   This was after huge sales of players.   The only reason we didn’t fail PSR in those periods was because we sold hotels and then the women’s team/our training ground.   Even with our amazing sales we haven’t been able to comply without needing to sell infrastructure. We’re very quickly going to run out of infrastructure to bail us out and due to our mediocre onfield performances the moment of players we can sell for book profit is dwindling more and more. Being 600m in debt is much worse than 60m though as they don't generate much more income elsewhere than the other big clubs Your example in the second to last paragraph feels suspect. Because using a % like that for FFP makes so little sense, if net loss is completely ignored. Sell £4m spend £10m is really the same as those? Haven’t actually read the FFP rules though so what do I know Precisely. It’s clear that the owners are trying to invest as heavily as possible but are held back by PSR. As long as they’re compliant, it’s obvious they’re not bothered about being in the red in the short to medium term. I just don’t see it how they will be able to develop all those young signingns.. i guess that’s where the multi-club model comes in handy Can he use a loophole to make his team finish higher than 6th? What i dont understand is that looking at the 2021 CL winning team its literally better than this one.  yes theyre bench is better and they have some good young players but theyve literally spent a billion to get worse. I dont understand it No offense you've sold your best players to buy average ones I wouldn't brag Yeah I understand the theory behind all of this, but it’s kicking *several* cans down the road. What happens in two years when they desperately need to buy two or three players to stay competitive just to still be Klarna-ing 300m? It’s madness The 65 players in the squad gotta live somewhere! Oh god....that's Barcelona music after seeing Trent join Madrid and they feel like they need to do a similar move I used to think he’d end up eventually at Real  But his form has dipped since then If he has one healthy season ( which is a long shot tbh) he will have a market, granted cut price for player of his ability. Everything is pure profit if you never paid anything for it in the first place. It all goes hand in hand no ?   Pure profit sales allows them to sign more players … 😂😂 Old United spent big on big name players not random South American talents and 18 year old goal keepers.  > new Chelsea seem like the old United.  Old United bought big-name players (often on the older side) for big money and stuck them on massive wages.  Chelsea are buying a *lot* of 18-year-olds on minimum wages with the idea of selling them in a few years. for profit.  How are they the same? United were buying washed expensive players for ridiculous wages, not potential wonder kids lol Completely different. I beg you to go look at that squad we had summer of 22 after Marina let Rudiger and Christensen leave on frees. There's no way you can tell me with a straight face you think that squad with Mount, Werner, Havertz, and Ziyech is better than Palmer, Jackson, Nkunku, and Neto. Yeah I guess we'll all just have to figure out how a touchline winger like Neto will fit with a manager who has explicitly said he uses touchline wingers. Pep was the first to do the opposite. The club decides the way they want to play. All teams play that style from the 1st team to the youth. The manager is there to implement that style. They have no say in transfers.  That's what Chelsea is doing. Nkunku is not a striker. Mucy better to just stick with jackson. Basically zero chance, the only reason he was even linked to us last week was because no one else would take him and Conte wanted Lakaka. Our main journos were briefed that we ended our interest in Osimhen all the way back in June. Not bad? Not many players are assisting every other game Impressive for neto in a worse and much less attacking team You tried to shit on him for his stats which wasn't well thought out Not in their transfer strategy. They have a long outlook of getting young players and having them grow together and sell the ones who don’t make first team. Their signings seem to correlate with that. Will it work? Unlikely. But as a fan, I’m here for it and hope it ends up silencing the haters. Otherwise I’ll be just drinking a couple more beers per game to get through the banter. That may give them profits on the books due to amortization, but I seriously doubt they'll make any money. We’ve had 6 windows to do that…. Wouldn’t you expect that to have happened by now?  the only Chelsea player we bought was a 19 year old left back with parents from the Northeast Yeah, he's good at LW too. An improvement over Sterling and Mudryk, but I feel they have higher priorities, like striker. Maybe they'll get a good striker too as they seem to have unlimited funds and PSR room Agreed but was responding specifically to the suggestion that   > Clearlake are selling academy players for 100% profit. They know what they’re doing, I don’t think they’ll be sanctioned but I think the PL will rewrite the laws on this sort of spending loophole  Which I don't think is a loophole, just very short-sighted hence the actual loopholes they're exploiting like selling things to themselves. Another season at 10th will probably bankrupt Todd in near future yeah > You’re making a massive assumption that the amortized fees break any rules.  I absolutely am not. Frankly it's a nonsensical statement, the amortised fees cannot by themselves break any rule - only Chelsea's ability to sustain them, while functioning as a football club, and staying above PSR rules can break any rules.  So let's consider if there's any evidence of Chelsea being unable to keep this up.... well as I stated in my comment [they've had to sell hotels to themselves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/19/chelseas-765m-hotel-deals-raise-questions-over-psr-compliance) without which they would have made losses that did breach the rules - as I said ""dodgy territory"". ~~I believe they need to be under 21 and club trained (meaning 3 years at the club between 15 and 21) to be exempt from counting towards the limit.~~(this was incorrect) But even assuming they make it for now it's surely going to get worse over the next 2-3 years unless they're able to sell 5+ 'first team' players and to do this in a financially viable way.  Will be interesting to see, they have always been able to sell well so might be able to keep themselves ahead of the limit/banish from the first team squads if necessary. to what end? Nobody is going to sign a player who has 6 or 7 years of contract left and is on PL wages, and that's assuming that he actually plays good enough to raise his value. His value is basically 0 If he wasn't injured constantly he could play for any team on earth. In the euros which is a tournament of what 8 games? this is not a slight with neto btw, why are you pressed? LMAOO chelski fans down bad I don’t think they paid 63 million with the intention of being a rotation player, every player plays when they’re not 100% you hear it from every former player, players are rarely ever 100%.   Chelsea also have a horrendous injury history record with their players right now > that won't happen at Chelsea (I hope)  If he's good it will, because it's what happens at top level football (sport). He's been steadily improving every season, it's obvious for those who actually watch him play. It's just his constant injuries been hampering him. Ask any wolves fan, they'll all say this guy is a baller. He's actually had a pretty decent pre season, and is well liked in the squad. I don't know if he realistically has a long term future here or not. But I doubt we'd see him move this window.   I'd assume we'll aim to play Neto on the left side, competing with Sterling and Mudryk. And Madueke will remain an option on the right. Either that, or Palmer will be deployed centrally and Neto/Madueke fight for the right hand side. I thought the grand plan was to eventually sign every single professional football player, thereby becoming the best team by default Sanchez  Bettineli  Bleach  Petrovic  Jorgensen  Penders  Slonina  Kepa  I think i m missing someone How would you score past 11 gk's!? Genius by Boehly! 11-0-0, they won't let in any goal if they have 11 in the goal post. Plus imagine all the field goal they're going to take, 3 pts each, all the gk must make a great kick team! Boehly masterclass all the way! I believe our owners think this is 7 days to die and need 11 GK to craft a premier league level keeper But a maximum of 3 from the same club. Chelsea are WAY ahead of you lol. Yeah man it's been three whole years since you won a Champions League, no-one deserves such pain Nobody expected Chelsea to challenge because they’ve been actively using transfer windows to make their squad worse. I don’t think anyone in their right mind since Boehly took over has thought “these guys are moving in the right direction.” >No one expected Chelsea to challenge for the league year one. City is just too well oiled.  This proves his point completely. Chelsea were nowhere near even the top 4 all season despite what they've spent and not much has been said. Or it doesn't seem like it >No one expected Chelsea to challenge for the league year one. City is just too well oiled.  ""Year one"" is a very weird way to describe a club that consistently maintained a very high valuation on players even amidst a single bad season with a similar core of players that had also recently won the CL. Dumb take I'd expect crystal palace to challenge for the league if they spent a billion over three transfer windows. Depends on what they were. Some are really simple, appearance based. But yeah, there's a good amount still left on the table in bonuses. [Sorry to say](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/12647321/raheem-sterling-chelsea-sign-forward-from-man-city-for-gbp47-5m) Ok name any of them? That’s 110 (60+50) so where’s the rest? I specifically said this window. Also, yes, spend was over a billion but net spend wasn’t. We’ve also sold a lot of players in 5 windows the the new ownership have had so far. Net spend is 650 million. Not that I’m justifying their policy, I’m tired of all the unproven young talent they keep buying and stockpiling. Just saying everyone keeps throwing out that “billion” number but no one seems to ever take into account how much they have also sold. At this rate I thought the idea was actually to field a starting XI with just goalkeepers, but I can see that happening if the need arises But you guys just brought in more 10s and two number 9s  the whole thing is a mess  next year you get another winger and 10 in who need to play We already have Enzo, KDH, Lavia and Caceido in midfield (6s and 8s). Not sure how there's space for Nkunku anywhere deeper than upfront. It’ll take years before we know if this model is successful of buying young players relatively cheap and then flipping them.  I’m very curious how it’ll work out.  But we also still have plenty of players to sell (Kepa, Broja, Chalobah, Petro) this window. It’s not creative accounting it’s just the FFP rules.  Estavao and Kendry were bought from their clubs this year.  But since they’re under 18 they can’t join Chelsea yet, so their fees are counted under FFP when they are actually able to join the club. Ever since our sporting directors came in that 1st January window under Boehly our wage structure has been very strict and I believe only 2 players were given over $100k/week. It also helps that as we’re these high potential kids to lower deals were offloading overpaid Abramovich era players; Lavia, Palmer, Gusto, Disasi, Nico Jackson, and Madueke combined make as much as Lukaku. Their manager made some comments about chillwell may not fit into his squad so gone status is he. If someone is dumb enough to pay 60m for Neto someone will be dumb enough to take chillwell and his big salary for 2 games a season. The others yeah you may be right.  Forgot about cold Hate when people shit on their own club for fake internet points. We got £20m ish for Hutchinson, who want even our academy player and barely saw the pitch for us. That's what's going to happen with most of the young players we're buying. Datro, casadei, etc etc. if we can make £10m-20m profit on each of them, that's pretty successful. Yeah I'm sure nobody has thought of it, you right. What we're doing is absolutely, 100% allowed. On the other hand they’re signing a load of players for their academy. Maybe rules allow those players to be sold for 100% profit once they’ve been at the academy long enough to be “home grown”? 600m is not worse when you have 10 times as many assets. No, but he can use a loophole to keep Spurs from a trophy. To a degree you’re right. That cl win was heralded as incredible because that squad did have younger players. However that kinda ignores things. Thiago silva, kante very much at the end of their careers, rudiger and Christensen leaving on frees to big Spanish teams, Werner while a bit of a cult hero really wasn’t worth keeping around, havertz not finding his feet really, both wing backs being very fragile etc. Jorginho has done well for arsenal but he’s not the linchpin he once was, mount situation was an entire mess.   While yes it was a good squad, it wasn’t one they were ever going to be able to keep together. Some of it was forced upon them, some of it bad luck, some questionable decisions around the time of the sanctions etc. They sell 6 of their 8 goalkeepers for an average of £20mil each to cover it.  Why do you think they're buying so many young players early? It's for precisely that reason - so they have a load of assets to sell when needed to cover in a specific year.  How effective it'll be is something we don't know yet (by definition it's a long-term plan and it's still early days) and ethically and as a fan it pisses of me off to no end, but if you look at it purely from an accountancy standpoint what they're doing can be argued to make sense - invest a lot up front so you don't have to invest anywhere near as much in future and have disposable assets to cover any year-on-year shortfalls. Yes, your description of the two words ""pure"" and ""profit"" put together is accurate, well done. I'm clearly not arguing the definition or semantics of it though, am I? The part that you're forgetting is the cash flow/ cash-on-hand portion. While the owners have an insane amount of wealth and can more than likely keep pumping money in, there is an upper limit to the cash-flow they have, which can cause bankruptcy. I doubt it can ever get to that point. These people aren’t interested in the actual answer they just want to cry because their clubs don’t spend as much as we do or sell as well as we do and refuse to believe that the new owners are getting away with bankrolling football. Old United let idiots who know nothing about building an elite environment run a club based on their preconceptions and arrogance.  Chelsea are doing the same. Only spending more money and fucking themselves over even harder. United at the least always had seniors in the dressing room capable of influencing fellow players, and had developed pros who were high quality. There was always a Matic, an Ibra, a Bruno etc... after SAFs players had phased out.  But that's tangential. The point is that Chelsea has people who think they know how to run a club, and they don't. And it's fucking them over. >How are they the same?  By ignoring the idea of squad composition to execute a strategy decided by people ignorant to how an elite environment operates. Particularly given the influence of the ownership.  It's not about the specific strategy, it's about the arrogance of outsiders thinking they have the knowledge to run a football club themselves.  And tbh they'd be better going with United's old strategy anyways at the level of spend they've had. But that's not really the point. The point is that the people making the decisions have the arrogance and stupidity combination required to mire a club in mediocrity, at the least. Mount was your two time player of the season. Werner is no worse than Jackson. Havertz is better than Nkunku. Neto hasn't even signed for you yet and is injury prone.  Besides, I'm not saying that you haven't improved in any positions. Palmer is obviously an example of that. I'm saying the squad itself looks worse. Maybe the players develop and achieve their potential and things change, but right now it looks worse or at best there has been no improvement. im not saying it about this transfer. But acting like Managers have 0 correllation to the players brought in is dumb as fuck JFC, of course managers don't sign players.   But if a manager plays without an attacking midfielder then wtf is a sporting director doing signing one. They may or may not get asked, ""Would you like us to sign this player"", but there will 100% be a link between the manager you have and the players you sign. Ahh right. Fair enough. I assume Lukaku will definitely be shifted by the end of the window no matter what. Not many players missing 100 games in 4 seasons. Especially when their club tends to play under 45 games a season [deleted] I tried to say his stats arent worth paying 60 million for him. I wouldnt say any player who isnt worth 60mil is bad or anything. They went for experience at first and signed Sterling, Koulibaly, Cucurella and Aubameyang in the first window then completely flipped that, sacked the manager and signed Mudryk and Enzo for 200m in January. They then tried to shift all their experienced players for a team of children. Since then they've moved towards the football manager strategy of hoarding wonderkids.   They also sacked their manager again, went for an experienced hire now he's gone and it's a prospect again.   They've also changed backroom staff personnel, structure, and responsibilities multiple times.  I don't believe you can argue there's been a coherent transfer strategy since they came in. At first they went experienced player route, then expensive young players ready for the first team, then wonderkids and loan farm. They had no idea what they were doing when they came in, this isn't some 4 year plan. They do seem to have settled on something at least, even if it is stupid They're not in this for money Clearlake owns like 50+ billion in properties. This is all about a couple billionaire's ego and they're funded by a parent company that wants to own a famous football club because of the future growth potential of the PL. I've never been worried about the funding coming into the club at any point in this whole clusterfuck, the problem arises if Clearlake run us into a financial corner where we can't spend due to PSR even if the owners have the money I was referring to the other Saudi vanity project, the Saudi Pro League We have Jackson, and are currently signing Samu. Currently have Lukaku, Broja, Datro Fofana, Marc Guiu and Deivid Washington. Nkunku can play up top in a pinch.   Not amazing quality but they are all here and need to clear house on a ton of those or at least loan them out. Fair point, I agree with you that selling the academy players isn't a loophole, just a bigger benefit on the FFP balance sheets since its 100% profit.  I couldn't help but point out that while Chelsea do well with selling players unwanted players as well as profiting from their academy, they also dabble in the dark arts of the football accounting world. You have any idea how much money clearlake has? [deleted] Yea we don't need to loan him so we can get a better selling price. We need to loan him so he can become a better player for us The season before last he got 0 goals and 0 assists Thanks for the insight! Maybe they trying some weird FM strat.   We pay you 99% less salary if you play 5 games or less.   Easy money the player thinks.   First training day arrives: ""Your kit is in changing room 56, training starts today at 9 on Training field 84."" Has it really only been 3 years? Man, it feels like 10.... And that's probably why Chelsea fans don't have high expectations, I wouldn't if I was them. Anyone with half a brain cell knows their new owners are clueless and everything they've done has been total nonsense. I’m very proud to hold one of the least popular opinions in football. >and not much has been said  What rock have you been under (and is there space for one more) How many of the players playing many games last year won CL? > Some are really simple, appearance based.  200 IQ move by Boehly, buying in Neto so they can save money by not playing Mudryk I think they have all been reported (by Shaktar president too) to be related to winning league titles and CLs 47million is cheap for such a big bunda idk why youre trying to be so combative about this when a full list is right here and takes less than 20 seconds to find  https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/fc-chelsea/alletransfers/verein/631  have fun mate I'll do better, I'll name 5 different combos   Lukaku and nkunku  Mudryk and fofana  Caicedo and lavia  Kepa and Cucurella  Enzo and Palmer. [here's a good set of combos to equal 150m](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/l2anwfsCbB) Mudryk was 90m Iirc ffp is over a 3? year span. So just looking at it from this summer alone isn't enough. I'm also a Chelsea fan, so I'm aware of how much money we've generated from selling players. But there's no way around it. Despite selling so many, it's still pale in comparison to the billion we've spent. Like you said 650 million in the red, how are we complying with ffp? And how are we even planning to recoup the money we spent? ~20 million for multiple gk each is a steep price if we're banking on turning a profit in a few years. It just doesn't make sense to me 38 GWs, 38 different wingers! Lukaku ""relatively cheap""??? What was the record transfer fee for goalkeepers with TWO professional matches played before we dropped 20m on Penders?? Those four combined are worth what? 40-45m? Gotcha, so Enzo and Caicedo probs the 2 (unless Mudryk got some huge undeserved bag), and then James and Chilwell being from before may still be high?   Don't know how Kepa and Lukaku's loans worked before in terms of wages but they'll need to offload them both asap Haha, true. Decent player on his day though Definitely not shitting on Chelsea. We have more than enough players, and a ban would mean we can't buy any more. I'm wondering if it wont be harder and harder to sell since the buyers know you have to sell ? Anyway to me it still seems like an extremely risky strategy where the risk is much greater than the reward Well the transfer strategy will certainly matter at some point, so you can't really say it won't matter who they buy Taking huge losses every year is not allowed under FFP. Academy players are 100% profit because there was zero cost to acquire them. Has nothing to do whether they are homegrown or not. So all these academy players they are buying for 15-25 million have to be amortised and carry a book value that needs to exceeded to record a profit. Well they don't have 250 players yet Ok It's funny that you think people are jealous of the way that Chelsea are run. Fair enough lol , I’m all for clowning Chelsea but this is a great move for you guys , Neto is a great talent No, this is literally how you didn’t end up in trouble, if it was for player sales only Chelsea would be in deep shit. I’m not refusing to believe anything, that’s just how it is. And you know better than professional sporting directors/ sports analysts/ scouting networks, how? [deleted] > By ignoring the idea of squad composition to execute a strategy decided by people ignorant to how an elite environment operates.  I'm not sure I agree with you there, their squad composition is pretty clear and are even selling/buying players specifically to suit their composition (Gallagher out, Omorodin in for example).  What you're saying is true **if and only if** you assume that every youngster brought in was bought to play for the first team, and that's not true - the vast majority of transfers are probably going have a David Fofana trajectory where they're sold with minimal minutes for Chelsea in order to fund other players.  Chelsea's strategy is ""buy a new first team squad that's young and locked in on long contracts, and then buy a load of youths that they sell for profit later on"". Which is also a long-term plan given the age of who they've bought, so if you're looking specifically at the first season post-takeover then it went badly, but even last year they finished above Manchester United with the joint-youngest squad in Premier League history.  I think you're being far too critical and harsh of what's a long-term strategy - and one that's already starting to take shape. They're not buying eight goalkeepers *to fight for the number one spot*, they're buying 2-3 goalkeepers for that and the rest are there to develop and if successful join the squad and if not be sold for hopefully more than we paid for them. If you didn't believe you were so arrogantly correct. You would know that those owners also own a baseball team, which also operates in an elite environment.  Also, the owners have taken a step back and allowed people who have expertise in professional football related activities to run the operations of the club.  So, YES, it does kill me when uninformed people arrogantly think they know best, but instead, it just makes them look stupid and ignorant >Mount was your two time player of the season.  Okay, that doesn't mean he's any good. Did you watch him the year before he went to United or at United? He was awful.  >Werner is no worse than Jackson  Oh lord...  >Havertz is better than Nkunku.  Lol not even sure Arsenal fans would agree with that.   >Neto hasn't even signed for you yet and is injury prone.  Still better than Ziyech.  >Besides, I'm not saying that you haven't improved in any positions. Palmer is obviously an example of that. I'm saying the squad itself looks worse. Maybe the players develop and achieve their potential and things change, but right now it looks worse or at best there has been no improvement.  Please, actually look at the squad and not just say this. No one who actually looked at both squads believes this. The only position we've actually downgraded at is centerback and only because Thiago Silva can't be replaced. Did you mean to reply to someone else? Yes very impressive. So the only older players the bought were in the first two months of ownership. I’m not sure there was a coherent plan then, but that is very much a transition time. However, since then they have stated their goals and started to align their transfers accordingly. I wouldn’t be surprised if they discovered just how risky(and expensive!!!) the Enzo/Mudryk window was and decided to focus on more quantity with younger players. I hope they continue to grab some more veteran players, but a vast majority of their signings are super duper young. So if we are using outliers to diminish their plan, I guess nobody has a transfer plan. None of those are good strikers. You also have too many wingers and gks, it didn't stop you from buying more. So I don't see why what you said would stop you from getting another stiker.  If you sell Lukaku and buy Oshimen, that's good, but if you buy another Jackson or Samu, well then you haven't improved your starting 11 at all.  At least Neto improves your left wing a little, even if it isn't his main position You are correct, checked direct with FIFA as others are reporting it it as explicitly requiring both. That gives a lot more flexibility, particularly if they sign people at 18 or younger making them ""homegrown"" by the time they're over 21. Lol keep reaching, man. Why go two seasons before? Why not go even further back? Time goes slowly when you’re in the football trenches. 10 managers maybe. What’s interesting is that I felt like as the season ended, Chelsea seemed like a good shout for a top 4 next season. But with the manager appointment, signings and preseason results, now it’s like … 7th seems about right? 🤔 Haha! It's mainly just fans though isn't it. Or pundits wondering aloud what they're doing.   No one's really taking them seriously whereas I think if it was another big 6 club they'd be slaughtered more for their league positions/performances after spending so much. The fact that they *chose* to replace the entire squad with unproven, impossibly expensive youth players does not mean we all should magically grade them on a curve. It's easy to ruin a successful club, no other major clubs consciously choose to suck for multiple seasons which is what you seem to be arguing we should have known Chelsea were willing to do. You don’t get to Boehly’s position in life by being an idiot…wait a second.. Nope The high value signings that add up to 150m are all players Chelsea would be happy to play >Lukaku and nkunku  Nkunku would be top of the teamsheet if he was available last year, we were absolutely crying out for him - it was only due to a massive injury we couldn't.  >Mudryk and fofana  Less than £150mil, and again - Fofana was injured for last season. Not starting because he wasn't available.  >Caicedo and lavia  Caceido always plays when he can, and Lavia would be pretty close to starting - but again had massive injuries and was out for the season.  >Kepa and Cucurella  Cucu started a *lot* last season, and bringing up Kepa as an example of ""Boehlynomics"" is ridiculous given the number of things that contributed to his wages.  >Enzo and Palmer  Always start if available.  Besides, Mudryk + Fofana wasn't £150mil, nor were Kepa and Cucurella. The original comment said two players worth 150m that they can’t play. None of those combos work for that. Well ackshuallyyyy ass comment 62m going up to 90m with add-ons relating to winning PL and UCL. Don’t think those add ons can be applied or will ever get applied I agree. They are taking huge risks. I hope for the sake of the club they actually know what they are doing. But as you know, we sold the hotel and women’s team to BlueCo and we also count ticket sales, shirt sales, sponsorships, etc. toward the profits. That’s how we are complying so with FFP so far. But I also agree that it’s unsustainable if we continue to spend big. It seems like our policy is now to sell as much as we spend. Including Gallagher, Chelsea can probably generate around £100 million in sales by they end of the window if they get deals over the line. Yeh I expect Lukaku and kepa to go this summer even if it means taking a hit. Boehly’s first summer screwed us the most with Fofana, Sterling and Cucurella getting overpaid too (nkunku got paid but he deserved it). Mudryk is overpaid but not terribly at around $90k/week but with Maresca’s system I think we’ll see a loan with option next summer.   Chillwell and James are paid high but tbf you can’t get mad at that when you consider how instrumental they were with Tuchel plus being leaders. I definitely see Sterling, Chillwell, and potentially Fofana on the chopping block next summer. Our squad has grown in numbers and in depth of quality (albeit unproven) and wages have dropped significantly. Yeah it's definitely risky, we probably won't make a profit on all of them, but it'll average or okay.   On your other point, I think if it was going to get difficult for us to sell, it works have done already. We've 'needed to sell' fire the past two or three years, we just seem to be good at it. £22m for Hutchinson or whatever it was, a lad who is clearly talented but has never properly player in the premier League, is a very good deal. Yeah I'm sure the club management has zero foresight. After all, multi billionaires are known for their lack of planning! Good thing we sell enough players to not take huge losses under FFP. Good to know, thanks! They're also not 600 m in debt. I know how to spot when a club is thoroughly incompetent, yeah lmao. It's only people who know absolutely nothing who need completely deference to people in power as an argument.  It's not that hard. >The fucking irony of this comment coming from anyone on /r/soccer lmao  People still don't recognise that criticism doesn't equal being capable of replacement. The same way people can rightfully criticise players without the ability to be on the pitch themselves, the same way you can hear when a piano player fucks up despite not being able to play the piece, the same way you can criticise someone turning into oncoming traffic if you don't drive.  This is, and has never been, complicated. I do not need to run a football club to watch someone fuck up running a football club. >I'm not sure I agree with you there, their squad composition is pretty clear and are even selling/buying players specifically to suit their composition  No it isn't. At all. They don't whether their midfield composition works and how to maximise particularly Enzo and Caicedo on a team level, they have an absolute mess of forwards with little cohesive idea of them playing together, they've spent £90mil on GKs without a single one good enough to start, they've spent what, £150mil on CBs without a single leader in the group, nor a central high volume passer.   I truly cannot express how bad their squad is, as a squad. Individually, great players. Together, not much more than just a group of guys.   >probably going have a David Fofana trajectory where they're sold with minimal minutes for Chelsea in order to fund other players.  Except that they're not going to all be sold for profit, they're not going to help the first team, and their funding more ineffectual transfers. They've spent €1bil.   >buy a new first team squad that's young and locked in on long contracts, and then buy a load of youths that they sell for profit later on"". Which is also a long-term plan given the age of who they've bought  And it's fucking terrible lmao.   >but even last year they finished above Manchester United with the joint-youngest squad in Premier League history.  A 6th place finish above a team that played like 15 CB combinations because of injury is not a win.   >I think you're being far too critical and harsh of what's a long-term strategy - and one that's already starting to take shape.  It's only Chelsea fans that think this. This is the equivalent of driving into the oncoming lane of traffic to skip congestion, and Chelsea fans are going ""Oh well you can't tell if it's gonna work yet, so you can't comment.""  It's actually possible to recognise bad decisions in real time. Shocking. >You would know that those owners also own a baseball team, which also operates in an elite environment.  The fact you think these skills are transferable is laughable. But please tell me how footballing profiles and the way the transfer market which doesn't exist in US sports is an area of expertise for guys who own a baseball team.    >allowed people who have expertise in professional football related activities to run the operations of the club.    Is that why their strategy hasn't changed, and the manager last season fucked off because he didn't wanna work under them lmao?  >it does kill me when uninformed people arrogantly think they know best, but instead, it just makes them look stupid and ignorant  Again, it's only Chelsea fans who think this is some piece of genius. Everyone else who isn't drinking the kool-aid and knows anything can see this is a fucking car crash. >Did you watch him the year before he went to United or at United?  I'll ignore the silly logic that one bad season apparently means a player is no good. He was also struggling with injuries, as he also did last season.  >Oh lord...  Sorry, I forgot everyone was lauding Jackson for how clinical he was last season.  >Lol not even sure Arsenal fans would agree with that.   You should ask them. I'm pretty sure every fan would, considering we've seen basically nothing of Nkunku yet while Havertz won Chelsea a Champions League and challenged for the title with Arsenal last year.  >Still better than Ziyech.  Still doesn't play for you.  >The only position we've actually downgraded at is centerback and only because Thiago Silva can't be replaced.  You've spent £1.2bn and I would argue Cole Palmer is the only player who breaks into any of the top 3 team's first XI, and even then that's debatable. Your squad looks no better than Spurs who haven't spent a fraction of that, or United who have been a laughing stock. Are you having a schizo moment? It's literally a direct response. If you're assisting every other game it's greatly diminished if you're playing half the games each season No, but just as goals and assists play into a players price. So does player availability [deleted] But that's kind of the point. They've changed tack multiple times.  1. Old experienced players. Didn't work coz they sacked Tuchel so quickly  Then 2. Expensive verging on elite players on long contracts . Like you say they then realised that's super risky coz if you get a bust you can't ship out like Mudryk then it's harder to manoeuvre in the market  3. Quantity over quality. Lots of middling players with potential but not many that have been good enough for the first team.  Now they seem to be moving back towards signing first team ready players like KDH and Neto.  Its been ridiculously chaotic and scattergun. The original comment was that they planned to spend like crazy in the first four years, and my point was just to say whatever plan they had coming in has been torn up and rewritten multiple times. My point is, I do not support the current approach of purchasing so much and bloating the squad.   Regardless of the quality of the players you purchase, a bloated squad will disrupt harmony and rapport. Players are friends with eachother and often pick sides, build cliques & become upset about their friends being benched(as they should).   It was one of the detrimental issues to Potter's reign (granted he was also at fault tactically but the bloated squad didn't help).   This feels all too familiar. New coach, large squad. Apparently the board is signing young players to develop them. Well, how will they develop when they are already in the market for their replacement but won't loan them out either.   Played Jackson one season and he showed promise albeit wasteful. What do we do? Go around and sign 2 more strikers. While chasing a 3rd in Victor.   I largely agree with you that it hasn't stopped the board from the uncontrolled spending but the problem is they have a very inconsistent approach to developing or improving the team. They should all together stop spending.   Sorry I'm speaking in circles here. We mostly agree on the issue. Because you said steady improvement 0 goals 0 assists isn’t improvement from the previous year, and it’s impossible to not improve on 0 goals and 0 assists. October to Boxing Day 2020 felt like 9 months at the time I guess we'll see. I agree with the assessment from The Athletic that we're probably the highest variance team. Finished 5 points off 4th last season, have some of our best players back from injury who barely kicked a ball last season like Nkunku and James, decent reinforcements in Neto, KDH, maybe Osimhen, younger players being more experienced etc.   But then you also have the new, relatively unproven manager, poor preseason results, whatever new injuries we might face etc. Honestly feel like we could finish anywhere between 3rd and 12th and I wouldn't be surprised. I mean even just isolating it to the one final against you lot there was the ""Blue billion pound bottlejobs"" line that was trotted out for weeks.  We're still getting lambasted at basically every opportunity (and rightly so for the bulk of it), it's just that there's plenty of other things to talk about in football besides us. >if he was available last year,  Except he wasn't. And the category was players not playinh  >Less than £150mil, and again  £80m plus £70m isn't £150m? And again, one was shit and the other never players soooooo....  >Lavia would be pretty close to starting  Again...  >nor were Kepa and Cucurella.  Except they were 😘  The tears are fantastic How many minutes did Lukaku and Nkuku play for you last season? How about lavia or fofana? Well you sounded like you wanted to know Why do you not have a Chelsea flair??? Sure and Gallagher will be the lion's share of that. Long term it doesn't seem like this approach can be successfull. Oh yeah, deffo wasn't throwing shade at Chilwell and James, on their day they're both amazing, just a shame they're spending so much time in the treatment room right now. Well football isn't exactly a financial instrument, and billionaires have also failed massively throughout history. Tbf, the net spend since Todd came in is 653 million pounds.   Obviously with the way some of those were amortised over 7 years it drops the yearly amount, but, you're going to HAVE to sell players yearly for a good price to not fall foul of the rules. !RemindMe 3 years [deleted] Well now you're just being biased and making stuff up.  >A 6th place finish above a team that played like 15 CB combinations because of injury is not a win.  Chelsea had as many if not more injuries than Manchester United did. They had an entire XI out injured for more than half the season, often better than the XI they started.  Enzo and Caceido are Maresca players - Enzo in particular, which is a large part of why they got rid of Poch. Enzo and Caciedo sitting behind Palmer or Nkunku, with Mudryk/Neto and Palmer/Madueke on the wings.  I don't know if you don't pay attention to Chelsea or just are looking for reasons to hate them but you're certainly *trying* to find things to bitch about.  Of course not all their players will be sold for profit - which is why I never said they would be. Sell one £20mil player for £50mil and you've covered a £20mil player leaving on a free and then some. It's why they're buying numerous youngsters.  Fuck me, you speak as though last season Chelsea had zero injuries, every player at their peak and still fucked up. We had *half a billion pounds* worth of players out injured for large chunks of it, no fucking wonder we didn't do as well as we did - and still finished above Newcastle and Manchester United.  >It's only Chelsea fans that think this. This is the equivalent of driving into the oncoming lane of traffic to skip congestion, and Chelsea fans are going ""Oh well you can't tell if it's gonna work yet, so you can't comment.""  If we're doing stupid analogies, you've put a kettle on, touched it 3 seconds later and gone ""it doesn't work, whoever made this kettle is a fucking idiot lmao"" and chucking it away. Even if you rate Mount, he's not better than Nkunku or Palmer, so it's moot anyway because we upgraded.  >Sorry, I forgot everyone was lauding Jackson for how clinical he was last season.  So is how clinical you are the only way to rate a player? Come on, Jackson is considerably better than Werner and considerably more clinical than him too.  >You should ask them. I'm pretty sure every fan would, considering we've seen basically nothing of Nkunku yet while Havertz won Chelsea a Champions League and challenged for the title with Arsenal last year.  Nkunku and Havertz came from the same league and Nkunku was better in that league than Havertz. Besides, Nkunku played several games for us last season and was great. He's also been one of our best players this preseason. But you will see soon enough.  >Still doesn't play for you.  Confused as to what your point is. Neto has been better for Wolves than Ziyech was for us. He's clearly an upgrade on winger.  >You've spent £1.2bn and I would argue Cole Palmer is the only player who breaks into any of the top 3 team's first XI, and even then that's debatable. Your squad looks no better than Spurs who haven't spent a fraction of that, or United who have been a laughing stock.  We haven't spent 1.2 billion. Addons do not count until they are reached. You're also conflating first team signings and youth signings. Angelo Gabriel is not a first team signing like Cole Palmer is.  But anyway, this just isn't even true lol. Any of Enzo, Caicedo and Lavia walk into Liverpool's first team lol, they went for all 3 of those players. They wanted Colwill too! Caicedo would walk into United and start over Mainoo. Shit, you'll see this season that Mainoo isn't even better than Lavia. Enzo would probably start for United as well. Gusto, our backup RB, is better than Pedro Porro and I rate Porro. I could keep going but Caicedo, Palmer, Lavia, Nkunku, Jackson, Enzo, Gusto, James, these are all players that would start for several top 6 teams.   If you paid attention to us last season, you'd know our biggest issue was injuries. If we were fit all season, we'd have finished top 4. We almost did even with the injuries. No, you are having a schizo moment I never once mentioned price, I only replied because people seem to think that Netos returns last season weren't great when in reality they were very good Netos assists are normally cut backs and crosses which I believe lowers that number, I don't think the stat is that great a measure tbh. Go look at the assists most are on a plate I get your point and what you are saying about the transfer strategy changing but I think after the first window the age component hasn’t change. Only how they are willing to dole out money. I also think that they are probably evolving as they get more experience with this transfer market. It’s different than any other sport on the planet. Mostly due to the fact that it is quite literally popular everywhere. I think we are in for some interesting years. I wouldn’t be surprised if in a few years, if their plans don’t work out, they cut their losses and sell. If it succeeds, we will be strong for a long period of time. At that point, it’ll be interesting to see if they continue to go after younger talent or if they adopt a more hybrid approach. I definitely miss having veterans on the team. So many stupid mistakes and compounding errors that won’t go away if you keep having such a young squad. Ultimately, I respect your position, but I do have faith that there is a plan and that it’s going to take longer to see. I also will be the first to say that it doesn’t seem like it will work, but with the analytics and insider information they have- I’m hoping they know more than us. Yeah, I agree with everything you said. I just don't understand why your board keeps repeating the same thing. They're not morons, if they were they wouldn't be in these positions of running a club like Chelsea. There must be some end goal they are going towards. E was out almost all season that year due to injury. Convenient how you leave that out. But don't listen to me. Listen to the wolves fans. Or do you think you know better than them. Chill bro, we dont even care if Neto does not work out, we have like a millions other player in case he does not work out, know Estevao Willian, Kendry Paez, maybe Gabriel and a trillion other potential signings ? If Neto fails, sure we have a million more to replace him ahahahahah Aye good point there I completely forgot about that. Maybe I misspoke.  I think a lot of the narrative is just down to bewilderment about what you're even doing really rather than any real criticism but maybe I'm not getting a real perspective of it > needing to buy new players because **you don't want them to play** too many minutes.  >Except he wasn't. And the category was players not playinh  No, it wasn't.  >£80m plus £70m isn't £150mil  Mudryk wasn't £80mil.  >Except they were 😘  £75mil + £60mil = £150mil?! Go look at the original comment. “Two players you don’t want to give minutes to”. Lukaku went out on loan, fair enough, but the other three players are integral when healthy (obviously been an issue). The point is the OP was trying to say Sterling and mudryk cost 150m. That isn’t true and people continue to say they did. You expanded the original comment but even then those players would be integral they just can’t stay healthy, I don’t think that’s the same thing as injuries can happen to any team. The players they’re selling now aren’t a part of the new system.  The new system is more so players like Omari Hutchinson, David Datro Fofana, casedei, Angelo, Andre’s Santos.  The players were selling this year are primarily deadwood (Kepa, Lukaku) or academy graduates that weren’t good enough (Broja, Maatson, Hall) or ones being sold for the profit (Gallagher, Chalobah) You're right we will have to sell players every year, which is why we keep buying youth players like Anselmino. Gosh Chelsea fans have become a parody of themselves at this point? You just gonna defend whatever stupid shit they do with the idea ""Well *you* don't know how to run a football club, do you?"".  The idea only the people in leadership positions know how to think is how idiots live. >Chelsea had as many if not more injuries than Manchester United did. They had an entire XI out injured for more than half the season, often better than the XI they started.  And because they had a ginormous fucking squad, they ended up being better off. Chelsea should just have themselves and everyone else be injured too, great strategy. And again, regardless of United, Chelsea finished 6th. They've spent €1bil. 6th.   >Enzo and Caceido are Maresca players - Enzo in particular, which is a large part of why they got rid of Poch. Enzo and Caciedo sitting behind Palmer or Nkunku, with Mudryk/Neto and Palmer/Madueke on the wings.  If you think these two work as a double pivot in a 4-2-3-1 I don't know what to tell you. Nowhere near enough calm and leadership, nor defensive discipline. But you're welcome to show me how it works without Lavia, and how that works without leaving other out in turn. Even with Lavia, there's still the issue of leadership and physicality.   >Of course not all their players will be sold for profit - which is why I never said they would be. Sell one £20mil player for £50mil and you've covered a £20mil player leaving on a free and then some. It's why they're buying numerous youngsters  Where the fuck are these magical £50mil transfers coming from? And you're welcome to do the math on how many need to be successes to cover the absurd amount spent, or why this strategy is more viable than just spending the money sensibly in the first place.   >We had half a billion pounds worth of players out injured for large chunks of it, no fucking wonder we didn't do as well as we did - and still finished above Newcastle and Manchester United.  Again, this isn't something to brag about. Both of these teams had significant injuries too, a much smaller squad to work with, and both have more encouraging and cohesive projects otherwise. It's a 6th place finish. It's not more than that.   >you've put a kettle on, touched it 3 seconds later and gone ""it doesn't work, whoever made this kettle is a fucking idiot lmao"" and chucking it away.  Except the problem is in your example, you're missing the point that the initial action is obviously illogical. It doesn't change anything to go ""Well we have to wait"" when the decision in the moment is obviously poor. >Even if you rate Mount, he's not better than Nkunku or Palmer, so it's moot anyway because we upgraded.  Mate you've seen Nkunku play about 10 mins of football. Mount was a Chelsea academy product who was your Player of the Season twice. Do Chelsea fans have any respect for their own club?  >Come on, Jackson is considerably better than Werner and considerably more clinical than him too.  Based on what? Last season they had a similar record of G/A per 90. Werner's best season at Chelsea landed him 23 G/A across all competitions, which is what Jackson got last season. Werner has had better seasons at Leipzig too.  >Nkunku and Havertz came from the same league and Nkunku was better in that league than Havertz.  Havertz left Germany four years ago when he was 21 and is younger than Nkunku, despite Nkunku only getting his big move last year. When Havertz left he was being touted as one of the biggest young talents in world football.  >He's also been one of our best players this preseason.  I don't doubt he's a good player, but pre-season means feck all. It's a bunch of friendlies against youth players and benchwarmers, and even then hasn't Chelsea's pre-season been awful?  >Neto has been better for Wolves than Ziyech was for us. He's clearly an upgrade on winger.  Neto hasn't played more than 20 league games in a season for Wolves since 2020.   >We haven't spent 1.2 billion. Addons do not count until they are reached. You're also conflating first team signings and youth signings.  I'm just adding up the totals listed online. You can argue it's a few million low or high, but it's over a billion anyway which is ridiculous. Money spent on youth players also counts. Why wouldn't it?  >Any of Enzo, Caicedo and Lavia walk into Liverpool's first team lol, they went for all 3 of those players.  Maybe Caicedo, but don't be stupid with the others. Liverpool and their midfield finished 20 points above Chelsea. Has anyone ever even seen Lavia play for Chelsea?  >Caicedo would walk into United and start over Mainoo.  I said they wouldn't get into any of the top 3's first teams. I don't know why you're talking about them getting into other teams when all I said was that Chelsea's squad doesn't look any better than them. That doesn't mean individual players from Chelsea wouldn't get in those squads, and vice-versa.  >If you paid attention to us last season, you'd know our biggest issue was injuries.  Same as United, same as Newcastle, same as Spurs, same as Liverpool. If my auntie had wheels she'd be a bike. Chelsea's biggest problem was that their squad is poor and inexperienced and they relied on Palmer to bail them out week-in, week-out. No but the person you responded to did. If you're not talking about price then how do you evaluate a transfer being good or bad? A player could score 5 goals as a striker but if he only cost a million that's a pretty decent ROI. [deleted] People are more used to Chelsea spending a lot of money in comparison to other teams >Mudryk wasn't £80mil  You're right, he was 75 and as was fofana. Lukaku would be integral would he? Kepa?  If every one of those players would be integral then you'd play even worse than you do now. I listed 10 players, so in your head, chelsea would ideally play   Kepa   Fofana, cucurella  Caicedo/lavia/Enzo  Nkunku/Lukaku/Palmer/Mudryk  With one other player? Lol. > And because they had a ginormous fucking squad  What_year_is_it.gif  They didn't have a ginormous squad last year. I don't know why I'm arguing about the workings of Chelsea for someoe who seemingly gets their knowledge of Chelsea from outdated memes.  What next, *Vitesse lol?* >Mate you've seen Nkunku play about 10 mins of football. Mount was a Chelsea academy product who was your Player of the Season twice. Do Chelsea fans have any respect for their own club?  He played 400 minutes for us last season which isn't a lot obviously but was very good.   Mate, why are you arguing this. It doesn't matter if he won our player of the year twice, he isn't very good. I wanted him sold.  >Based on what? Last season they had a similar record of G/A per 90. Werner's best season at Chelsea landed him 23 G/A across all competitions, which is what Jackson got last season. Werner has had better seasons at Leipzig too.  Do you actually watch football or just look up g/a on wiki? Not a single person who watches Jackson and Werner would ever consider Werner equal to Jackson. Come on.   >Neto hasn't played more than 20 league games in a season for Wolves since 2020.  And he's still better than Ziyech.   >Maybe Caicedo, but don't be stupid with the others. Liverpool and their midfield finished 20 points above Chelsea. Has anyone ever even seen Lavia play for Chelsea?  Yeah they finished 20 points above us because Klopp is one of the greatest managers of all time and we had Poch. Caicedo is better than Endo. Fact.  >I said they wouldn't get into any of the top 3's first teams. I don't know why you're talking about them getting into other teams when all I said was that Chelsea's squad doesn't look any better than them. That doesn't mean individual players from Chelsea wouldn't get in those squads, and vice-versa.  Okay fair enough. You're right you said top 3 not top 6. I don't think Aston Villa will be top 3 again but when it comes to Man City and Arsenal, yeah fair not all of those players get into their team. But they've been building those squads for 5+ years and we've been building ours for 2 years.   >Same as United, same as Newcastle, same as Spurs, same as Liverpool. If my auntie had wheels she'd be a bike. Chelsea's biggest problem was that their squad is poor and inexperienced and they relied on Palmer to bail them out week-in, week-out.  Not all injury crises are the same. Liverpool missing Thiago, matip, Doak, and Bajcetic is not the same as us missing Reece James, Nkunku, Fofana, and Colwill, who are all starters for us. Talk to them about it them I prefer watching over stats, which is why I told you to go look, I've seen his assists and in most he is the main reason for the goal £60mil plus add-ons for CL and PL, how many of those do you think he's got so far?  Besides:  >£80m plus £70m isn't £150m?  >Mudryk wasn't £80mil.  >You're right, he was 75  for a £60mil player. How TF are you moving the goalposts this much and *still* missing? Fofana, Cucurella, Caceido/Lavia/Enzo, Nkunku and Palmer all start if everyone's fit.  Cucurella, Caceido, Enzo and Palmer played most games they were available for last year, and Fofana/Nkunku/Lavia were injured all year.  Lukaku and Kepa are different kettles of fish - bought in under Abramovich. Lukaku isn't not playing due to performance, he was starting regularly until he did that stupid interview and torpedoed his career (and has since been moving from italian club to italian club). And Kepa was a panic buy after Courtois threw his toys out of  the pram a few days before the transfer window closed - he was too  expensive for what he is, but A) there's extenuating circumstances for that and B) the main reason we've replaced him is because Boehly & co want as few remnants of Abramovich-Era Chelsea as possible. In two years they sold all but two of the *squad* that won the Champion's League.  I know you're looking for reasons to hate Chelsea, but the players you're talking about don't actually match the argument you're trying to make. To be honest I think you’re being purposefully obtuse. I said that Lukaku went out on loan and that was obviously for a reason. That will likely happen again and is a non factor. For the rest of those players yes most of them will start or play most games. Not every integral player starts every game for every team. But outside of Lukaku Chelsea would love to see all of those guys getting big minutes >They didn't have a ginormous squad last year.  Yes, they absolutely did lmao. Chelsea senior squad size before this summer was already really big, as by the fact that basically exclusively senior players were given minutes. How many new academy grads played meaningful minutes, in an injury hit season? How many people were on loan because they couldn't get game time at Chelsea?   >the workings of Chelsea for someoe who seemingly gets their knowledge of Chelsea from outdated memes.  Alright dude. You continue to trust the process. I'm sure it'll work out great. Did you really just blame the poor season on injuries and then celebrate signing a player who misses 50% of games a season?  Also, Poch had you playing some cracking football at the end of the season, don't try and rewrite history.  Also on Mount 'it doesn't matter if he was our best player 2 years in a row, he isn't good'.. you offer a lot of absolutes which are based on nothing but opinion. Alright mate, you do you. Forgive me for thinking you weren't deviating massively from the topic at hand [deleted] The base amount was £70m lol  > Chelsea will pay an initial £70m [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11661/12683698/wesley-fofana-chelsea-complete-signing-of-leicesters-french-defender-in-gbp75m-deal) and if you're arguing over what the exact bonuses were then you can show me the contract any time you want Honestly, I'm amazed Chelsea fans are so happy to defend the people running the club because you're going exactly down the same route as Napoli/Lazio/Parma did which led to them being placed in administration.  Good riddance tho. Couldn't happen to a more deserving club Again, to use the comparison to Manchester United - a comparison that *you* started, by the way.  As a team that you're claiming can't be compared to Chelsea last season because of how many injuries they had, Manchester United had what, Kambwala and Hannibal that were not expected to play, didn't do well enough to stay in the squad afterwards (unlike Garnacho and Mainoo) and had >100 minutes?  Conversely, Chelsea had Ugochukwu and Gilchrist?  >How many new academy grads played meaningful minutes, in an injury hit season?  How many Manchester United youth CBs played meaningful minutes in a season that, as you say, they had 15 different CB pairings?  Chelsea at times had Chilwell or Cucurella as a LW. They played Enzo or Gallagher as their CAM because both Nkunku and Chukwuemeka were out. They didn't play youth for prolonged minutes, because they played players out of position instead, *exactly as every other club does*.  I've mentioned bias before - but how many youth players did Liverpool play last season? Newcastle had massive injuries and only played one youth player for a prolonged stretch (Lewis Miley), do you think they have a more ""ginormous"" squad than Chelsea?  You're picking odd metrics, looking for things to get angry *with Chelsea* about, do you apply the same level of criticism to other teams too or is it only ones you dislike? I wasn't deviating, you were though He's a very good player, you've just got your back up because your a spurs fan and I used one of your players as an example Oh my god, your own links don't even say what you're claiming.  >he was 75 and as was fofana.  >Chelsea will pay an initial £70m for Wesley Fofana  [Talking about Mudryk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64281139#:~:text=Chelsea%20have%20completed%20the%20signing,for%20Chelsea%2C%22%20said%20Mudryk.) £62mil base.  So tell me again how £70mil + £5mil in addons, plus £62mil = £150mil? Ok so does that mean that you can’t name two players that were worth a combined 150m that Chelsea doesn’t want to give minutes to? Because that’s the whole point of this discussion and now you’re changing the subject. >a comparison that you started, by the way.   A comparison to *United's previous owners* in terms of *attitude towards squad composition*. If this is the level of reading compression, to see that and go ""Well ackshually United finished below Chelsea last season"", then seriously man, this conversation isn't worth anything to anyone.   >Conversely, Chelsea had Ugochukwu and Gilchrist  Even in this, you mentioned a first team signing? How much did Ugochukwu cost? More than £20mil total package, right? Do you see the issue here on Chelsea's suboptimal spending when you need to include £20mil signings in   >How many Manchester United youth CBs played meaningful minutes in a season that, as you say, they had 15 different CB pairings  Can you see the difference in raw quality between Kambwala as an academy player and Evans vs Badiashile or Disasi? Do you understand academy players and free transfers being the back-up options over £40mil players? When I saw squad bloat, it's not just raw numbers (which I should have mentioned before tbf), it's dedicated first team signings with significant costs (and relatively significant wages compared to other teams' last ditch options) that don't need to be there, particularly given they don't represent a balanced squad anyways.  >Chelsea at times had Chilwell or Cucurella as a LW.  These two are width holding fullbacks in possession. Them playing ""LW"" was them doing what they've both done for significant portions of their careers, playing as a wingback.   >They played Enzo or Gallagher as their CAM because both Nkunku and Chukwuemeka were out.  Do you understand what you're saying here? You understand Gallagher as of right now is a better 10 than Chuk is? This was essentially one injury to a starting quality player, and one injury to a youth prospect you spent too much money on. And instead of signing a 5th CB for good squad player money, you coulda signed an actual squad quality 10, but instead tried to trust Chuk? This chain of comments wasn't talking about the price then? Because it was before you replied to me... [deleted] Show me what the bonuses were. He's closing in on 50 appearances, there's bound to be bonuses tied to that, goals, appearances in Europe, etc.  You're claiming shit with 0 evidence and then getting whiny when someone else proves you wrong. No I can, Lukaku and kepa. That's 160m right there as a conservative guess as Chelsea fans seems to like Bro, there's a million replies talking price, go post on those Maddison was excellent before his injury... >You're claiming shit with 0 evidence and then getting whiny when someone else proves you wrong.  Show me he's met the bonuses if that's what you mean, how TF have you ""proved me wrong"" by just crying ""chelsea bad"" with exactly as much evidence?  >makes a claim   >shows no evidence for claim   >""You're mad I proved you wrong"" So two players that were purchased by the old owners? That doesn’t fit your narrative [I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/272SpE36pC) [deleted] Please go outside lol. Works done, so I don't need to waste any of my free time arguing over numbers neither of us can confirm or deny.  You want to spend Friday night debating that then you do you. My narrative is Chelsea is going down the shitter. It's a very easy narrative to form given they are in fact going down the shitter financially and on the pitch Good man He had an injury that kept him out for months, it's not surprising that he wasn't 100% after. And with England they have so many great players in his position he wouldn't have got a call up anyway >You want to spend Friday night debating that then you do you.

Crazy attacking force in hindsight on paper that season I always wonder what would have happened had  he not been robbed. It was a failed transfer but he got a decent amount of assists and we got most of what we paid from PSG. He gets talked about as one of the worst transfers of the premier league era… can I introduce you to Antony? Was coming off a brilliant season at Madrid and then looked so good against Leicester, I remember being very worried at the time (this was also before United had a million false dawns with their signings, so we weren't conditioned to expect that yet). Thankfully it didn't work out. That goal against Leicester was definitely the highlight of his tenure at Utd Man wasn't horny enough for Van Gaal ""Louis Van Gaal is the worst coach I've had in my career"", Angel Di María That was *TEN YEARS AGO*?????? 🥲 Best moment of his time there was pulling Michael Oliver's shirt and getting sent off. Thank you Ashley Young  https://gifs.com/gif/golpe-de-ashley-young-a-ngel-di-mara-manchester-united-vs-psg-champions-league-2019-YWEmg2 That Vardy dive and Leicester comeback absolutely killed us. Van Gaal lost his bottle after that and it was the  score 1 goal, backwards-sideways passing after that. I don't even care, the assist for Mata's second goal at anfield was worth it all [removed] [since nobody else does it:](https://youtu.be/iXecGQxlnCA) The Manchester United management has contributed for too many years to the dissapearance of the club’s greatness Ashley young 🔛🔝 I have a lot of respect for Man Utd as someone growing up in the 90s’, but it’s sad. That place has been a graveyard for player careers for the last 10 years.   What they have done to my Casemiro has been criminal 😭. Part of a legendary midfield. Loved by all- the baby faced killer. It was a terrible deal for both Di Maria and United Streets will never forget **THAT** chip at the King Power 😮‍💨 He was playing left wing back 😂😂😂 Van Gaal hated south americans, same thing happened with Román in Barcelona. The United obsession Cross-shot king! ¡Hoy vamos con los pibes pero por una temporada! Didn't LVG stick Riquelme out on the wing during his stint at Barca? Dobby is a free elf RAT Louis Van Gaal and South American players are like water and oil What a player Snek No shot that was 10 years ago, fuck me Because Van Gaal was a washed up geezer at that point. Ruined a lot of good players. 🐍 Part of Louis van Gaal’s army Seeing Kevin Davies playing in a North End shirt scares him off Sounds about right lol The second most hilarious sports example in a first year business course. I can't remember if it was actually amortisation that was being discussed but it would make sense if it was.  (First place was an economics exam which included the premise that the Warriors were doing very well. Get out of the exam ""did you see the Warriors question?"".) Beginning of the downfall He wanted to go to PSG anyway, but PSG were sanctioned and limited to a net spend of 60 mil in that transfer window, and they chose to make David Luiz their big summer signing. ManU after you know who has a knack of signing great players to form a mediocre team Manchester united sucks the life out of people's careers it seems like. Together perfect ears 10 YEARS AGO!? Damn time does fly. Touched a ref and caught a ball with his arms on the pitch. Legend Man United lost 4-0 to MK Dons in the League cup Classic Man. United. He could have been a Starboy in Manchester but NOT under van gaal also man UTD from 2013-2016 were a very strong team but they had shitty managers tbh I hate this stupid little cunt but cant deny that he was world class everywhere but with us. Not the first nor the last player that had his worst days at United. Just watch Anthony play like prime Mahrez once we get rid of him A snake Wrong type of recruitment for us at the wrong time, but snake is always a snake. Insane player. Terrible coach for him. Sad. Started off silly good for them before the break in. This manager killed chicharitos career, but luckily he had 2 amazing seasons in the Bundesliga after being player of the month multiple times. DiMaria doesn’t look like a human being. I know that’s kinda rude but he looks like a Harry Potter elf or something I was living in Manchester at the time and was so excited when he was signed. Man Utd and Argentinian players don't work... Exhibit Veron.    Good on di Maria though. Went on to have a successful career and win the world cup. Believe me, we remember.  We still use a snake emoji for him in the Reddevils subreddit. I remember his face during that 3-3 match in the ucl a few years back. Priceless. 🐍 He was one of my favorite players ever. It was really sad when he left. Insane player. Terrible coach for him. Sad. didn't work out for him. still remains one of the all time greats of the game. Wonder if things would have been different if we did sign him along with Ozil back then. I think London would have been more palatable for his family. **While the general rule is that throwback posts aren't allowed, there's an exception for events that happened 5x (5-10-15-...) years ago, and for remembrances of events that are honoured every year.

Thats United for you. You can just see the pure hatred Van Gaal has for Argentinians in his eyes.   /s I mean nobody who leaves Man Utd goes on to better things, they say. 😂 The season Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra was replaced by Marcos Rojo and 19yo Luke Shaw. It’s that season when Van Gaal said that United didn’t have a striker capable of scoring 20 in a season right ? Fun to knock out of the FA cup too. Update: I meant the League Cup in October 2015 ... oh well Meh. Most of them were past their prime. In fact, Di Maria was the only one that was in great shape back then (but clearly didn't work out at Manchester).  Falcao perhaps wasn't so much past his prime but returning from a very serious ACL injury. He never looked fit during the entire season. Could be his injury was badly managed at Man Utd, could be bad luck, could be bad decisions by Falco himself, doesn't make much of a difference.  Van Persie played a World Cup (winning a bronze medal and scoring a phenomenal goal against Spain) while actually injured the entire tournament. Never recovered to his old heights. Dutch press has referred to it multiple times saying RVP ended his career as world class striker by choosing to play in that world cup.  Rooney was one of the few players that actually had a decent season under Moyes the year before, but he was in rapid decline already, typical player that peaked early, his physique was always going to demand its toll, and his lifestyle might not have contributed.  I guess Juan Mata is perhaps debatable, I think he had a good season under Van Gaal. But others will remember better than me.  All in all it was a crazy attacking force if you had all those lads in prime form. But most of them weren't.  \[edit\] various typos and phrasing, wrote the comment on mobile. Strong on paper.  Shame that they had the structural integrity and performance of wet paper though. Imagine that combination on FIFA 13 Just played FIFA 15 last night and forgot they had all these guys at the same time They played a midfield diamond against Leicester that year where Di Maria played left with Rooney behind Falcao and Van Persie. Think that was the 5-2 loss. They were called the Gaalacticos.. Context is crazy, only Di Maria was in there prime! You could argue Mata but he was permanently played out of position! This isn't fifa I'll never forget rooney's Bicyclekick against city Wasn’t Falcao sort of cooked by then? He had some bad injuries I recall. For 10 years, Man United have had the best team on paper. They were all washed I think he would've still wanted out. Him and his wife clearly didn't like Manchester and they didn't want the move to United in the first place, PSG were clearly their first choice at the time, they just didn't have the wiggle room to afford him, iirc. His wife still hated Manchester regardless Probably still would have left, robberies happen the world over, France is no exception (where he moved) and his wife would have likely wanted to move for a different reason He wanted out before the robbing, that just confirmed it Second highest assists in the prem that season. Second only to Fabregas, having spent half the season on the bench Price wise, Antony's signing if definitely worse. But from expectations, everyone expected more from Di Maria than Antony. He only stayed for a season so we can't really judge him As you recouped most of the transfer fee I don't think it's fair at all to call him one of the worst EPL transfers. Not even one of the worst United transfers imo. You got a not entirely terrible season out of him and didn't lose that much money, not all of them work out and important thing is being able to minimize the losses, which you did. What are you saying about my goat 😤 I remember him scoring that brilliant chip goal and then it all being downhill from there. Oh he had that chip but then we lost the game 5-3?  I remember Vardy in that game and thinking he was an absolute cheat code beast of a physical player and wondering what other sort of monsters they had down in the Championship. Didn't settle down in Manchester due to various reasons but especially due to the robbery situation I remember him catching the ball like it was American football and didn't even have a foul called. Iirc, United was leading that game 1-3 and ended up losing 5-3 No Argentine wants to play with that mouth breather. I know…. 😳 Ashley young is in his 19th season in the premier league!! Little did we know Vardy was one of the best PL strikers of a generation, we just thought we were getting exploited by some 27 year old beast from the Championship. The feeling is mutual - the guy's a rat faced, gutless cunt. Our transfer policy in a nutshell past 8 seasons. Tbf they got him for €75M at the time and sold him for €63m  So a €12m loss which is way better than most transfer fees From our side we were signing a world class CL winner for 59m. Which was at that time a fair price.  If the snake didn't want to come, he should have made it clear. I'll never forget that red card he got against us for touching/smacking the ref on the back. He hated them so much he signed 4 of them while at Man Utd How's it feel Tbf, he had a shit attitude and wanted to leave, no? He was good enough despite injuries and hating the city, his house getting robbed and his wife hating the entire England population and weather Nah, to be fair to them he started great, then after his house was robbed he really dipped in form. Him and his wife were also out in the press calling Manchester a shithole and he clearly wanted to leave.  He didn't even want to join United in the first place, he wanted the move to PSG, but when they refused to pay he was forced to join United. I think it was mutual, he hated it there and PSG gave them the chance to get most of their money back. I don't think it was likely to get much better. Some players just don't like it in certain leagues. And Daley Blind. Shaw was very highly rated at the time tbf, and still is a very good player if not for injuries. I will never figure out how we got 20M for Marcos Rojo. That Marcos Rojo that marauded bare chested? [deleted] was it the season MK Dons won like 4-0 or something against them? You’re getting Manchester clubs mixed up.  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30860467.amp You knocked City out of the cup that season, not us? Danny Welbeck knocked them out of the FA Cup. Mata was still a square peg for a round hole unfortunately. Lots of great moments, but just another symptom of signing names to make a splash It still blows my mind that Rooney is retired and grown into a chubby middle aged geezer and Ronaldo is still playing.  And to top it off Ronaldo is OLDER than Rooney. Madness.  Just goes to show you what looking after you body & genetics can do.  he got rid of chicharito who ended up doing amazing in the german league. I remember mata was really misused.  He didn't have pace and any physicality so we kept trying to play him as a RW. He unfortunately wasn't very effective as a RW. But still a creative threat from right side.   This was kinda the reason why United fans were crying to get Sancho, cause there hadn't been a major RW sighing for almost a decade. > but he was in rapid decline already,  He was 28 bloody years old. Tyler blackett and paddy mcnair in defense  Midfield being held together by a 33 years old carrick Plus he hated LVG His wife did make me laugh though when she was talking about English weather Jorgelina said “I don’t blame him for going there. It was horrible, so horrible. I just told him, ‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it’s night time at two o’clock.’” We were blocked by FFP and couldn’t spend more than 60m and a good portion of it went to Chelsea for David Luiz. We also wanted RM to accept a loan with obligation to buy but they refused. He posted on his Twitter his joy for joint PSG before the deal fell through. United was always a pit stop. Tbf he did go to PSG the very next season Shouldnt have moved in the first place if his heart wasnt with us. You cant be forced out of the club until the club pays you out or mutually terminates the contract. “I didn’t like it at all… I can tell you. People are all weird. You walk around and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you. The food is disgusting. The women look like porcelain.  “Angel and I were in Madrid, at the best team in the world, perfect food, perfect weather, everything was perfect. And then came United’s proposal...  I told him ‘no way, no way’, but he kept saying we will be a little more financially secure and we have to go. We fought about it… We try to be closer when things go wrong.  “I don’t blame him for going there. It was horrible, so horrible. I just told him, ‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it’s night time at two o’clock.’”  lol she REALLY hated Manchester! Accordingly, he was also robbed when playing for PSG ...but also 🐍 got legit benched by Young. Didn't deserve a start whatsoever in the last few months of the season Antony was a bigger financial error. Cash outlay is a too simplistic way of comparing transfers from different eras. You have to look at price as a percentage of revenue to make any reasonable comparison  Di Maria was 13.7% of our revenue. Antony was 14.5%, but we got most of Di Maria's fee back and we'll barely get anything for Antony Typical ManU logic rating every player that comes in to the club legends. For all DiMaria suffered that season (injury, being robbed, and VG playing him out of position) how could anyone expect him to have 20 goals and/or assists. Had they been patient and helped him settle (he went from sunny Madrid to rainy Manchester have you), we would be talking about him like a legend and someone who could carry the weight of the #7 jersey. He turned out to be a legend everywhere else he went (PSG, Argentina 🇦🇷, and in his return to Benfica). It’s fun to watch united fans wallow in despair these last few seasons. He continue to be brilliant until pull his hamstring against hull then comeback and LVG start his mad scientists expirementing him as a second striker ( was also the famous phil jones corner). Finally the red card against arsenal + his family getting burgled was the nail in the coffin Jamie vardys doing Random storytime:  My mate and I would watch matches together. We would take a shot at kick-off, at the half and upon final whistle. We also agreed for this match it would be one shot for every Manchester United goal and two shots for every Leicester goal. There’s DLC to this story but as you can imagine, it was a match I’ll never forget! Because Argentina players have so much class Yeah, not so young anymore Shit attitude towards a shitty club yeah. All went downhill after SAF. Would you blame him? He wanted to join PSG when Madrid were forcing him out as well, I believe it was FFP restrictions at the time that meant they didn't make the move so he was left with United as his only option. Even though its might seem as not that great transfer it was after he had a great world cup no? Didn’t Blind play CDM that first year? It was the next year he played CB, and was actually okay though very undersized. Yeah Shaw doesn't belong in that sentence, was seen as a big get by Man United at the time he was pretty good in the world cup for argentina that year tbf we only got about 3M + Nani loan out of that Top scorer of the season: Wayne Rooney with 14 (all competitions) No, he was not.  He didn't have any functioning setup to regularly feed chances to the forwards. He had the strikers, not the gameplan Yes, infact this happened on the same day United signed Di Maria Yeah   None of them featured in that game, but yes. And Zaha was an unused substitute. Yep.  That’s when I was wondering who that Dele Alli kid was for MK Dons because he looked amazing. Whenever I see that score, I instantly also think of the 4-0 equivalent embarrassment when Real Madrid lost against a lower league team in a cup game. Think it was the 09-10 season Nah I was thinking of the league cup in October that year, but the win over City was also amazing, Lee Tomlin was scary good Mata was Chelsea’s player of the year two years in a row, in years they won the Champions and Europa League. Had something like 30 goal contributions in both seasons. He was a phenomenal player until Jose decided Oscar was somehow better (he wasn’t) and was mismanaged at United. He was always played on the wing to fit in Rooney at 10 and he was so much better as a 10 at Chelsea Doesn’t make my statement wrong. I loved Rooney but he wasn’t the player he was two, three seasons earlier. Carrick was still class when fit. Criminally underrated career in general You hate him or you love him, isnt that interesting Not surprising. Di Maria was clearly talented and he showed glimpses of it at United (beautiful goal against Leicester that no-one remembers because they came from behind to beat us).  LVG essentially had him playing in a system where he regularly received the ball with his back to goal like he was Mark Hughes. He'd never done that in his life.  Louis was entertaining and had clearly been a successful coach but we got him when he was a drunk, belligerent Hunter S Thompson of a manager; raging and spouting strange rules the players had to abide by. He hated LVG cause DI maria was providing assists and goals when He was throwing him papers and criticizing his  passing accuracy ( which recently KDB said means nothing if you doesnt provide final balls )      LVG is a fraud. LVG's fault Honestly, I can easily see how afyer playing in Portugal and Madrid, a move to Manchester can sound pretty dire. Think it was PSG having FFP constraints for the season he left Madrid. The next season it wasn't an issue. >‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it’s night time at two o’clock.’”  This is the part that always gets me. She's an honest woman. No word of a lie. >""Yo no le dije ""por tu culpa estamos en Manchester"". Yo le decía ""amor me quiero matar... dos de la tarde y es de noche""     Even more hilarious in Spanish, I'm bursting in laugh, how had I never read this in spanish, lmao. ""more financially secure"" lol Her quotes always crack me up, no filter whatsoever making Manchester sound worse than Tijuana. we need a tier list of club cities the opposite take of victoria beckham. ""Everything about this place is shit""   -Jorgelina I mean if the bird had shit in Di Maria's mouth instead, he'd have 7x Ballon D'Or now, but fate chose Young He was already downing tools by that point, so anyone could’ve benched him Never looked at it this way, interesting point! He's extremely liked too in PSG and Juve. Literally he's beloved everywhere except for Manchester 😂 >Typical ManU logic rating every player that comes in to the club legends  I have zero idea what this means. Explain please Hey we are not the ones starting shit. The burglary didn't help and he hated Van Gaal, part of me wonders how he would have done under Jose Chelsea are a shitty club and they manage, Christ every time I’m in London I can smell sewage all over popular/crowded areas and people still go there He had been excelling for two years as a defensive midfielder at Ajax, followed by a great world cup under van Gaal als a left-back in 2014. Logically, of course, he was played nearly exclusively as a centre-back at United, with centre-back Marcos Rojo played at left-back.  God bless those van Gaal years You may be right. I remember it as him being played at CB very early on, could be totally wrong Wow, I don't know if I just never knew this or completely forgot, but he went all the way to the finals as a left back. I think he played as a left back for us a couple times, but he didn't impress that much.  That does explain why United bought him, though. Clubs tend to go crazy over international performances and really like to ignore club performance outside the 5 major leagues. If Falcao didn't score more than 10 goals then he did nothing that season [deleted] We still don't.  Alcorconazo! Good times man He had over 50 g/a in the Europa league season Possibly figured oscar has a better work rate than mata The other guys point is still correct. Mata was signed as a RW, and he was very clearly not that type of RW.  He was competing with Rooney for the 10 spot, and while Rooney was on the decline, he was just a better fit in midfield for that team than Mata.  This meant we played RvP in front of Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, which could work on paper, but it just didn't and we started playing Di Maria as a full on wingback, sometimes a 10, hardly ever at RW, which was probably his best position.  There was nothing wrong with Mata. United just shouldn't have bought him, because we needed something else.  Same goes for the vast majority of the players signed in the Woodward era. A bunch of talented players who didn't fit the system most of the time. Expensive each and everyone of them as well. > He was a phenomenal player until Jose decided Oscar was somehow better (he wasn’t)  Mata was a great player but he was a classic 10 at a time when classic 10s were getting phased out unless they could play midfield or on the wing or they were Messi (and had ridiculous goal contributions that justified the lack of defending in central areas).  Oscar was a very good player himself, and he was a better fit in Chelsea's system—he was a crucial part of Chelsea's 14/15 EPL title win Mildly. LVG did that to all the Argentine players. He is a cunt. I >LVG is a fraud.  But he has hair... Kevin deVryune? LVG is obviously not a fraud. We have character building weather... also whilst on the topic Di Maria form dipped with the sunny weather. only just realised that now. How many here hear her in Sofia Vegara's? I mean if you’re rich and can afford to live in Madrid without breaking a sweat, then Manchester really does sound grim. If you care about weather at all, Manchester is definitely worse than Tijuana. Xolos are clear Most english cities not named london will be ranked badly. Madrid will always be number one then It's almost like there's another factor which influences how people perceive the place they live... ? May need a a comma in that first sentence between “in” and “to”, but basically saying MU fans instantly judge expensive players to the legends of the club and when they show even the slightest sign of not performing to that standard they are exiled and deemed a failure. Antony is going to be the next one this happens, as it’s already going on, and there’s a long list of former players as well. Instead of developing players which is what made United so great in the 90’s/00’s. I get this is the case at a lot of clubs, but just a shame that MU had a gem of a player in DiMaria and failed to realize it. United had an injury crisis around that time. in defence Blackett, Borthwick-Jackson and McNair were all given debuts to offer cover for several of these, as well as needing to play some midfielders at the back including Daley Blind. after proving to be one of our better defensive options, based not just on playing ability but availability and consistency as well, he found himself almost exclusively at either CB or LB for the remainder of his time at the club. hence the positional change.  it was also at this time Young and Valencia were converted from wingers to fullbacks, which I think along with Blind are now more known for their defensive roles, so it shows a lot of his positional choices and tactics were actually rather astute. I didnt even realise it was the same coach twice lol. Any idea how the same coach didnt know how to use him at club football? [He played as a LB against us and just couldn’t handle the mighty Adi Popa (even if he is now playing for the army s Steaua)-Rusescu (7 matches and 3 goals for Sevilla!)-Chipciu strike force though!](https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/match/2010060--fcsb-vs-ajax/lineups/)  Edit: According to Transfermarkt it s just the one season 13-14 where he s played a lot at DM (50/50 between that and LB), 12-13 it was just LB with some random CB sprinkled in there He was just randomly very very good at LB for Argentina. Was pretty shit every time he played CB too which is hilarious. Honestly, no clue why he never really played there at club level He came on loan and scored 4 in 17(12). He was injured quite a bit but he was class. That's mad that both of them only hit 20 league goals twice.   Of course injuries for RVP, also injuries for Rooney but out of position, self sacrificing etc etc. So in other words, he had three strikers that could do it. >RVP only got 20 league goals twice in their whole careers  Surely this isn't right? Respectfully disagree He had 50 g/a on the dot which is crazy.   He had 12 goals and 12 assists in the league, then got a bunch of assists in the cup competitions. that’s one of the weirdest transfer between 2 big teams  Mata’s best play was as a 10, a classic creative attacking only 10, and then Jose came and he didn’t want to play with a 10, so he chose Oscar to play as an 8 and build the team around him  and then United came knocking and they also weren’t playing with a 10, even Rooney move to 9 or false 9 during that time, so either United changed their formation, put Mata at 10 and build the attack around him, or they’d get a mediocre version of Mata  which they did, smh Underneath all that hair is a bald head, which you could argue makes him an even bigger fraud. you're telling me you wouldn't take you're next vacation in stoke? All the best English cities don't really have decent football teams that's why.. York Bath Gloucester Canterbury Salisbury Cambridge Oxford Chester Whitby Lancaster Barcelona better. absolutely.    I was mostly remembering her getting dragged in the newspapers for talking about the smell of garlic. https://youtube.com/watch?v=LoZXEbo96Lg > Blackett, Borthwick-Jackson and McNair  Man, I thought at least one of those names or Tom Thorpe would be in the squad for a long time, a next Wes Brown. Wasn't that injury crisis also the time Martial got injured in a warm up match and Rashford appeared out of nowhere. Necessity, or he just had this perception of him as a potential centreback. When Blind was a youth player he was a centreback first, but he broke through at Ajax as a left-back and excelled as a DM (in his first period). From what I remember Blind was mostly decent at United, but nothing special. He never embarrassed himself. He excelled at centreback when he returned to Ajax, he was crucial during the famous 2019 CL run Didn't know how to use him? Blind has had his best years of his career at center back. Maybe Van Gaal was on to something as not long after Blind played a fucking semi final in the Champions League as a center back. Yet you Reddit experts think Van Gaal didn't know how to use him. Embarrassing. Yes, in his best and last season (13-14) he became captain and DM Tbf that was arguably Popa's best season with us. Steaua just clicked together that season. There is a fair argument on which team is better between last season's Steaua vs that magical year. Chiriches had an outlier season too (and I'll argue that he's the player that was the biggest let down when he moved abroad) I vividly remember I supported Germany that final because I just couldn't imagine a weirder image than Marcos Rojo winning the WC. He didn't perform at United, didn't at Chelsea either.  Crying shame he wasn't what he was after the injury.  I remember when he was at Porto on FM, I'd sell whatever players I needed to raise enough funds to buy him, as it meant I'd win promotion/the league.  And that was well **before** *that* game.  **[Talking bout this](https://youtu.be/fKBO5KZzC1c?si=OubnmtL3tE59sdmM) He was far from class for us. He should have had at least 10. So many times he made a run or had himself in position to bang in an easy goal and no one looked to find him.    I distinctly remember screaming at the TV half a dozen times to pass to him. He was ass not class, not sure which Falcao did you watch [deleted] [deleted] Yep. Classic Woodward. tbf he was still better out of position than what Man Utd had I'd sooner go there than Wolverhampton, if Madueke is to be trusted. I'm biased but honestly Bristol is one of the few nice larger UK cities. It has some very nice areas. But the football teams there are dogshite. Cambridge is pretty depressing tbh. It's very, very flat. The weather is pretty grim too. Is very isolated; there aren't many other cities or areas close by that you'd want to visit. It had the train to London and that's kinda it.   I lived there for a bit and absolutely despised it. It's obviously not a bad city, but I would never choose to live there if I had other places as options Milan and Paris would also be in with a shout.  As would Monaco obviously. Barcelona has the beach. That's cool, but as a city I much prefer madrid McNair at least went on to a respectable championship career, better than can be said for the other two. Borthwick Jackson had a beautiful cross and that's about it sadly. Blind was decent at centre back but I reckon left back was where he would have shined Tbf pundits at the time were saying the same bullshit  He's too slow or poor in the air and weak   He still handled did well i loved him and wish he never left You said two years at DM and that would have covered our EL run so that s why I checked. To be honest fair play for even remembering that far back to have this conversation, well done Is there? I mean, back then we made the Europa League RO16. We beat CHAMPIONS LEAGUE HOLDERS and 3rd in the Prem Chelsea at home and were still ahead at halftime at the Bridge. We won a far stronger league that year (we sent two teams to CL qualifiers that year as we were 14th by coefficient, now we re 26th, 29th on the live count and we re losing a good season too for next year) and in general won 3 in a row. The round we made this year (CL Q3, obligatory fuck Morten Krogh) was the round the Romanian champions (CFR) and non champions (Vaslui, RIP lads, you were a fun team, proper cult heroes in there) started at back then. Hell, CFR got 10 POINTS IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GROUP STAGE that year AGAINST FERGUSON S MAN UNITED, GALATASARAY AND BRAGA, that was the level of competition in the Romanian league back then and we still won 3 in a row. Meanwhile last year we made….*checks notes*….ECL Q3 (that literally didn’t exist in 2012, might I add) where we fell to Nordsjaelland despite them getting a red card in the first leg because Pantea was stupid (still a great season by him though) and Chiriches demanded all those wages in order to get a red himself. Like, good team but we faced a Danish team in 2012 too and it was a more well known one, we topped a group consisting of Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Molde. Oh, and we made it past CSKA 1948 in Q2 last year due to a Djokovic double and then Becali proceeded to kick him out the team and he joined up with Rapid and their disastrous fall off (I actually thought he was good for us though and he is now at CFR somehow).  Was it an overperformance? Obviously, Chelsea destroyed us in the CL the very next season. But keywords, IN THE CL. Like, that one competition that literally no Romanian team made since (thanks Moti, I still hate you for those penalty saves the season after that). I don’t know, the team last season just doesn’t have any sort of European pedigree to stand up to that. Call it an outlier season and the team clicking but you can’t argue with those results. Even looking player by player, we had a good striker (Compagno), was he better than Rusescu? Nah, the man scored 4 goals in 18 matches that season and was let go in the winter for stupidly cheap (if we re talking season only. I do think that letting him go was a massive mistake especially for that sum, he s a 1000 times better than Miculescu ffs). Rusescu scored 26 in 47 in 2012-13. Tarnovanu vs Tatarusanu? I don’t remember Tatarusanu fucking up crosses that much, he was the NT starter after all even if I do think he had some periods he was criticised in as well (to be fair I don’t actually remember stuff very clearly now, it s been 12 years after all). Rapa vs Pantea (being generous and not saying Cretu after Pantea s injury lol)? Pantea has literally had just one season at this level, meanwhile Rapa pocketed Hazard. Latovlevici vs Radunovic? I like Radunovic and hope he will extend  but only one of them could score free kicks and did his famous goggles celebration against Ajax mate. Idk, I just can’t go against anyone from that run on principle.  And yet, I can’t help but feel that losing Coman along with the ref shenanigans in the Sparta game was a missed opportunity. We were supposed to get blown out there. We really werent. With a fair ref we could easily have qualified against Sparta and then add in Coman too? We could have somehow made CL with fucking Miculescu up top, that would have been ridiculous. Anyway, I just hope Zwayer will have mercy on us and we ll at least make EL, then we will apparently lose Olaru too…(what a stupid red he took vs Poli Iasi though, his head is definitely not here anymore) I mean, Germany's starting left-back was Howedes, not exactly a memorable champion He was just a random young defender back then, I don’t believe he had any sort of reputation in 2014? I genuinely thought Falcao was going to be the best striker in the world at one point. Injuries just affected him badly. I had in in FM and he score over 50 goals a season in all comps.  Just utterly broken What was *that* game? He was even better at Atletico, then he started great at Monaco before tearing his ACL.  He was never the same after that. The guy could jump over everyone, was probably the best header of the ball I've seen below 6' and he was 5'9. Absolutely great finisher as well.  At least he got that one last great season with Monaco in Mbappe's breakout season for them when they had the craziest squad with Bernardo Silva, Moutinho, Lemar (crazy that season), Fabinho, Bakayoko (crazy that season), Mendy, Glik, Sidibe. Agreed I thought he was awful. Usually I'll defend and love all of the random short term older players we've signed (even Ighalo!) but Falcão was one I could never get in board with. Same one at the club as you. He had no service. Just like the rest. Rooney scored 17 goals the year prior lmao, under Moyes! Why are you acting as though it’s an absolute disgrace to suggest he could’ve got a couple more. RVP scored 26 the year before that!!  I watched United during those years, unfortunately. I had the dis(pleasure) of watching LVG ball in action, if action can even be a word to describe how we played. It was the absolute worst I have ever seen us play, to the point where I can’t go back and watch the games because it only works as insomnia therapy.  The point is, we had three world-class strikers, with world-class creaters behind them, and LVG did fuck all with them. Wow I still remember that 30 goal season.  There was also they time he mised like 2 seasons due to a groin injury Madueke’s action provides irrefutable evidence that Wolverhampton is shot Bristol city unbeaten in championship so far > It's very, very flat  So's London.  London is disturbingly flat. I was there for about three weeks on holiday in 2018 and spent almost the entire time freaking out about how flat it was. I recall only one slope in the parts of London proper we visited (somewhere near St Paul's) and also we went to Greenwich but, as I recall, only the flat bit (I did mean to go back but we didn't make it... so much to do, only three weeks to try and do it in). Munich might be up there as a second tier Tyler Blackett has had a decent career tbf He wouldn't have. Blind has zero speed. Any average winger would have torn him a new one in the Premier League. You would have needed to play 5 at the back to guarantee someone covering his ass. Blind's strength lies in his (early) crossing, long balls and vision. If you pressure him with two guys on the left your whole team will be fucked He could fill in at CB, LB or DM but he was slow, poor in the air and not very strong so he was never amazing at United. Good footballing brain and solid technique though. Yeah I thought he played at DM for a bit longer than he did, it is what it is You know I was about to argue with you about how I think Coman + Olaru > chipciu and Tănase. But I also noticed a name that slipped my memory, Pintilii (who Imo is definitely better than Sut). So I stand corrected. But Coman's quality definitely needed to be applauded. I would argue that Coman is the best layer Steaua has had since 2012. The only player that can also be argued is Stanciu Also, ditto on the Sparta game. The ref was shameful. And now Sparta is likely to advance VS Malmo. Don't get me wrong, they're a good team. But we made it closer than it should've been.  Overall I am not too optimistic on this season for Steaua with Olaru and Coman out. And I am also against playing Miculescu. I'd love to take a gamble on Romanian players stagnating abroad I.e Ianis Hagi (who admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of but he has sparks) and Nicolăescu (who plays regularly in the eredivise but he's not setting the world alight. He isn't a Flashy transfer but every match I've seen of him he's been solid) Schalke legend and Raul teammate, so great guy in my books.  Honestly it was a weird era for fullbacks I think the 2012 Uefa Supercup UEFA Super Cup 2012 LVG's football was the worst I've seen United play in my lifetime. [deleted] Well he played some of his best football at LB for Ajax against the likes of Dortmund You know what, you actually have a point with Olaru vs Tanase, I mean at least Olaru isn’t clubbing every night and being fat and he does have a bit higher G+A per game looking it up (73 in 185 for 0.39 vs 78 in 230 for 0.33), also was definitely more involved in both phases of the game than Tanase who could be a bit of a luxury player at times. Last season looks massively impressive due to all the goals but compared to Tanase in 12/13 it really is a case of more goals but less assists for an overall weirdly similar result (15 goals 6 assists=21 G+A vs 7 goals 13 assists=20 G+A for Tanase). Coman…holy crap I didn’t realise he outshone Chipciu by this much by pure stats alone. I mean, the man has almost double the goals (34 vs 63) and assists (38 vs 62). Then again, this is in a lot more games (169 vs 223) and 3 more years but the per game ratio is still not even close, 0.53 vs 0.42 is a massive difference. Coman did have that period of about two years after the Backa Topola game (most insane game I ve ever seen) where he was marred by injuries and lost his quality (looked it up, he literally had 1 single goal in both of those seasons) so I didn’t think it would look that good but yeah, phenomenal before and after that. Especially last season when he started scoring free kicks too…For a while there I thought we would end up with both Coman and Olaru as the top 2 scorers in the league but unfortunately Olaru slowed down at the end. I guess there was also a different level of league at that time as I said but you have convinced me. Pintilii though, how could you forget him man, one of the few dudes that impressed Becali enough to be allowed to retire here and even be a coach, if he had his Pro license he d probably still be officially coaching and we would have never gotten Charalambous lol. Then again, we all know that it s Becali that really matters.  Yeah, Olaru out as well will take some of the quality out of the team but I think we will end up slotting in Tanase instead of Olaru and continue to slog it out with the shit strikers like we have done so far so idk if it will get much more worse than it is already (Tanase do be looking out of sync with the team so far but I guess it is natural when he has just rejoined, then again he has been training with us for longer than that hasn’t he?). Of course you are against playing Miculescu, literally everyone should be but Becali somehow isn’t, the fact that he kicked out Compagno but allowed Miculescu to amass 102 appearances is just insane, a traffic cone would probably be more useful than him a lot of the time. Then again, he did just score last week vs LASK so I guess I can’t criticise him right now, forgive me lad, go on and score another on Thursday, okay?   Ianis is an interesting one as there was definitely potential in him but that injury really derailed him, even at the Euros he didn’t do much in the group except earn that penalty vs Slovakia but that one penalty got us through and then vs the Netherlands he tried but they broke his head two minutes in so he bled until he got subbed off (speaking of that, we are getting that ref, Zwayer, against LASK. Come on UEFA, really? If he is against us again I riot, they d be taking the piss at this point). He would apparently be really cheap in terms of fee (350k according to reports today with Rapid s bid) but the salary is insane, 1.3 million euros per year is 108k per month, that s almost double what Becali wanted to offer Coman to keep him, Rangers would need to cover a large part of that in order for anyone here to be interested (they might be willing to cover 40% of it though?). Imagine if Rapid gets him and he actually does well there though *shudders*. Nicolaescu…the one at Herenveeren, you mean? I think I have heard of him a few times during Moldova s nice Euro qualifier run, he seems to start for them and did score 4 goals in that run but isn’t doing great at Herenveeren indeed, only 5 goals in 22 games last season and most of those are substitute appearances. Could be worth a punt. You know Becali though, you will take the cheap playout transfers that he knows and you will like them. At most an African if he is feeling fancy (those were good though, please get more).  Overall we ll have to see how we get on after this playoff, there is a LOT of time to recover the league especially with the halving being there and having a match in hand but we do need to start on it, if by matchday 10-12 we re still not winning then it s panic stations but we re always shit in the summer in the league so I am not that worried yet but some warning signs are definitely there The worst you've seen United play in your lifetime so far* Yeah LVG era was the most boring shit I've ever seen from United. Under every other manager you play decent for at least some time. You blow some teams out of the water then get embarrassed by Brentford or something, but at least that's fun. Under LVG it was always a boring 0-0 or 1-0. So boring we couldn't even banter you. Falcao's stocks were quite low at the time He always had great backup in a well-oiled machine. Speaking of Olaru, that might've been the clutchest goal of his career Ma jur ca voiam sa il injur ca a sutat la coltul scurt de acolo, cum pana mea a intrat golul ala:)) Eu ma uitam la un stream  cu o întârziere de 1minute. L as fi înjurat și eu dacă nu știam ce urmează :)) Eu pe RTV, pacat ca n au HD ca in rest au facut atmosfera dupa meci:))"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Crazy that Atleti paid €127.2m for Joao Felix…feel like he never was able to adjust to the big stage. Current market value is at €30m what a downfall even though he is still young and technically still could make a turnaround I forgot what Lavia’s face looks like Where would Estêvão Willian be on this list potentially? Fabio Silva cost 5 million less than Vinicius and Rodrygo. Fucking Jorge bloody Mendes. Absolute thief. Was dembele not a teenager when barca bought him? Or bellingham? God I remember when Luke Shaw was the #1 spot about 10 years ago. The amount of money being spent in the sport is ludicrous Damn Real has been good at buying teenagers. Rodrygo and Vinicius feels like steals at these prices That Felix transfer was absurd then and seems even more absurd in hindsight. He showed nothing worthy of this pricetag, what were they thinking. Lavia fourth and hasn't had more than one game for Chelsea lmao Does anyone have an estimate of PSGs total outlay to for Mbappe during his time there? Wasn’t Bellingham 19 when Real signed him? Fabio Silva is awful. I’ve seen some shite fucking players at rangers that cost us around 150k that are better than him. Worst player I’ve seen in a rangers shirt in a while.  Absolute fanny aswell. You know you’re awful when both Rangers AND Celtic fans hate you I remember how people were memeing real for buying brazilians teenagers for 45m to replace CR7 whle leaving Benzema as the only real attacking threat  With hindsight, I'd say Perez made it work Mbappe, Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr are the only definitely successful transfers there. Should we really count transfers that were obviously some sort of money laundering scheme? (Fabio Silva) The final fee for Anthony Martial was €52m. Nearly €180m spent on one player and then make absolutely no money whatsoever back on him.  PSG must be fucking fuming. What has happened with De Ligt's career since? And Mbappe now leaves on a free at his prime 💀 Mbappé? That’s Lottin.  IYKYK This picture of Mbappe reminds of fifa 17 with Lottin 😂 180 as a teen is crazy That Felix transfer still baffles me!  The moment news started linking him with a move to Atleti I was confused and thought it was pure nonsense, and the fact it actually happened was even more bizarre. He's simply not the type of player that Simeone uses or needs. He didn't fit his style of play, and yet, Atleti still paid an insane amount of money for him. So him failing was to be expected, I just don't understand how their board didn't see it as a mismatch for their club. Crazy that the only 3 that lived up to the potential (so far) are playing at Madrid with a 4th one having a shot at it.  (Yes, I do not consider De Ligt as having ""lived up to his potential"" when you remember how much he was hyped up during his Ajax days) Who the hell is Lavia and why Chelsea keep doing this things? Vini was a fucking bargain Easy to say that Félix is overrated, was a waste of money, etc, but that move was as bad for him as it was for Atlético. João Félix was indeed an unique talent and everyone could see that he would not fit Atlético. Only 2 of these have paid out for that club so far , damn Vini/rodrygo/endrick for just over Felix is insane business Real Madrid with two of the biggest bargains Crazy…Endrick already wears the Brazilian 9 shirt Rodrygo, Vinicius, and Endrick for almost the price of Joao Felix 💀 Normally a player is under contract for five years, what is the advantage in paying a young unproven talent more than 50mil? 180 for mbappe and now Madrid get him for free… €40m for Fabio Silva is... well, it's mental. Especially in the middle of a pandemic and a club record fee for Wolves.   Although it is slightly funny to me that we essentially paid for him because we bought Jota for £41m two weeks later. Bellingham literally missed that list by 2 days Madrid scouts are something else! It feels weird seeing wolves on the buying side of a chart like this Joao felix is the biggest flop corresponding to his big transfer fee Vini for 45m is crazy.. It is a disgrace what Barça did with Roque. 3 of them worth it? Paratici smoking some insane fucking drugs at Juve Will roque get more minutes now that xavi is gone? Diego Simeone is nearing the one billion euro mark in terms of his transfer spend as Atletico Madrid boss. El Cholo has spent a total of 987 million euros on 60 different players since arriving at Los Rojiblancos in December 2011 To come to think of it  RM basically spent 120+ mill on 4 players to secure their present and future attackers So many bad/failed signings there Fabio Silva for 40m is wild considering a few years later he's been mediocre for Rangers in the spfl this season. Atleti might regret spending that big on Felix because he never adjusted to their style of play. Vitor Roque was bought for 30 + 30M€ in bonuses. Confirmed by Deco.  This 40M€ figure doesn't exist. These stats are pointless when inflation isn't counted I wish there was more than 10. Seeing Arda Güler would be great. I remember being downvoted for saying Silva to wolves made no sense Flamengo a cabra 🐐 Filthy transfer business by Perez, guy is a visionary 4 brazilians 🤩 thanks for the laugh Still blows my mind that Mppape left on a free transfer. So .. the moral of the story is only pay overs for teens if Real want the player I guess? This Brazilian trio goes hard ngl. Real Madrid have been cooking over their last few years. And to think. Martial is the only one on the list that came good. Mbappe is still untested after playing for such a small team for so long.  S/ If only mbappe stayed at Monaco And 180 were still not enough for Kylian Lavia is unfortunate getting injured. He seems promising and I would hope that injury doesn’t impact his growth Felix is such a flop for that transfer money The bottom 5 have more trophies than the top 5 lmaooo By adding 10 million to Endrick, Vinicius and Rodrygo transfer fees you get one Felix lmao Lavia was 19 when he was transfered Amazing how many Brazilians  there are. And how many are over rated. Its fun how you can see that Brazil got better at negotiating Lavia 👀 .. Where are Bellingham and Dembele? There are some really questionable transfers in that list lmao price tag kinda says otherwise but did Martial look as promising as Mbappe with Monaco? Mbappé is gonna finish his career as one of the greatest to ever do it and lavia was never seen again Nobody can beat Neymar santos, that was something else €180m for Mbappe compared to €15m (around €26m today) for a 19 year old R9 from PSV to Barca... crazy how much transfer costs have increased. I remember when Wolves billed Silva as a “generational talent” I think Mbappe was also one of the first to move, so his price is actually in a lower inflated market than most of the others. I wonder what the top 10 looked like when he first made that move We had Chelseas pants down of Lavia saying we were in for him, they took both him and Caicedo for about 4x they are both worth lmao. Barca with zero good buys. most of the players on that list hahahah What is a Lavia mbabe looks skibidi photoshopped 💀 As a United fan….. Big fucking ooooooooof whoever wrote that most expensive teenager list never went on a sex tourism trip to Thailand Joao felix is overrated (change my mind) How many minutes has Lavia played for Chelsea? To think Rodrygo and Vini costed Real the same is wild. I hate Vini’s ethics as he always seems unsportsmanlike, but the talent is undeniable Im convinced that Lavia would have won a player of the year in Belgium and would be further in his career is he stayed. Mbappe is so overrated Check the relationship between Benfica, Atlético, Jorge Mendes, Enrique Cerezo and Luis Filipe Vieira, that may explain why Atletico paid 120 Mendilions, pardon me, Millions of Euros for Félix. It's crazy how few games he had before atletico gave benfica that fee The biggest decline on that team is Saul in my opinion. He was such a great player at such a young age. I honestly thought he would become top 15 player in the world at some point. He was also good for national team both senior and u21. When I red 2 years ago that he's going to Chelsea on loan I was like wtf, in my mind he was still a beast. Don't really know what happened to him Crazier that it was Atletico of all clubs to do that too. They are usually extremely shrewd in the transfer market, buy low sell high (if they do decide to sell). There are certain clubs that expect take that risk/ make that misstep, and Atletico were never on that list until Felix Was such a weird thing. Ofc hindsight is always 20/20, but he wasn't really the typical player type for Atleti. Especially with that kind of money Felix has been mediocre since Atleti signed him Everyone talks about Barca splashing Neymar money on getting Griezzman, no one talks about Atleti splashing Griezzman money on Felix They had just made over 100 million by selling griezmann and were desperate for a replacement Technically yes he could. Would need to adjust his attitude and turn up more than once every 10 games though. Man had a 3 month purple patch in portugal and atletico went insane.. Is that really the craziest one? Fábio Silva is a second league player at best and was sold for that much. João Félix was absolutely brilliant for Benfica as a youngster. Incredibly talented and wasted by the club(s) and himself. Atleti's only chance to swap him with PSG for like Kolo Muani. Or maybe City would swap him for Bernardo or Grealish. Bernardo said a lot he would want to leave to Spain.   Or...of course...the saudis. Felt so crazy for Atleti to go that big, how did they even get that kind of money to throw at one player? And why was it the least Simeone player possible? wasn't that the summer atleti sold griezmann? benfica probably fleeced them knowing they had money. Benfica are master sellers :) Thought he'd be what Dybala was pre injuries Something dodgy with that deal. no worries a.madird did it well by selling griezman to barca for 120+ bonusses after 2 years they got him back for 30m? [deleted] Watching him play this past year, no way is he worth 127m... A flop that no one talks about because no one wants to criticize Simone I can't believe he only played 32 minutes in the Premier the whole year. That's the same here. What really happened to him? Injuries or poor form? I still think he should've gone to Liverpool instead. 40m base + 25m addos as per Fabrizio, so at most would put him at 4th. He couldn’t even cut it in the Scottish league, even Rangers fans were happy to see him go when his loan expired lol. Don't know what wolves were thinking spending that much on a 18 year old who has no physical attributes. Especially for premier league It’s a disaster signing All clubs must compete to sign elite young players. Only real Madrid has massive pull that attracts players. It  is irritating to see their fans claiming that Real Madrid management is genius for signing ""hidden"" gems for cheap.   It is not like players like Rodrygo, Camavinga, Vini and others weren't on the radar of other clubs. It is the fact when Real Madrid comes calling.. Players obey . Same with João felix... What a business It's funny, Jorge Mendes is either a villain or a hero, depending on if the people at your club know his tricks.  We've been fine with him at Liverpool, bringing us Fabinho, Jota, Darwin, and helping us shift Fab when his legs had gone. But then you see some other clubs and how they've ended up with crap... Wolves felt like they were cheated in the deal. Bellingham agreed when he was 19, but contract was officially signed when he was already 20. Dembele signed August 2017 but turned 20 in May of that year. Rooney was the same price but it was 20 years ago. Adjusted for (football) inflation it would be right up next to Mbappe's fee. inflation, amiright? Should be said that Vini was signed just weeks after making his professional debut for Flamengo. Extremely good signing but it was a big fee at the time   Obviously Juni Calafat knows exactly what he is doing though Bare in mind they signed another Brazilian wonderkid around the same time for 40m euros or so and I think they already released him for free. Of course 2/3 is a strong hit rate, but buying such young players is a risk. The best signings in recent years tbh. They get in there young It’s their youth academy, buying other people’s youth 😂 Well we talk about Real Madrid... It used to be Barca such a legend club  but it def has changed since messi's departure.. You see how dangerous real built the team with the youngsters ...  They might fail for a couple years but they come back. Perez isn't a joke Unlike us, they actually play their teenagers purchases. Pellistri at madrid wouldve gotten a lot of minutes instead of rotting at alaves or on our bench. Member when vini was a joke? They still had faith and let him play. We gave pellistri 10 min and since he didnt score 5 we benched him for the rest of the season. 'Holy shit we have sold players for a ton of money, we have to spend it real quick, who's the most hyped wonderkid right now? Joao Felix? Sure, here's 127 million' if you watch his Benfica highlights on youtube (and there are plenty) before the transfer and considering his young age, Felix really looked like one of those generational talents. Probably he is/was a generational talent, he just did not make it. They thought he was a sure thing to reach his potential, which obviously was an error. He was one of the best talents coming out of Benfica's academy for many years and that says a lot since it is maybe the best academy in the world  He never managed to move past being a ""flashes"" player though. At Atleti, Barca and even Chelsea there have been flashes of quality that makes you think ""okay I understand why he once went for 100M+"" but can't manage to put it together. Also I think the price tag got to his head and made him think that working hard is not a must Yeah but he had that one great champions league match. After Hazard to Real Madrid, the biggest flop of the past half dozen years. That has to be the worst piece of transfer business Atletico did in their history tbh Anyone in this thread calling Felix to not have been worth that much money at that stage has either got memory issues or has started watching football after then. Like others have said,  Felix was considered a generational talent at that point with his performances at Benfica. 127m is inflated sure but he was worth 80m at least at that point. That would still put him second highest there. Hes young ,he cant still recover and find his footing 32 minutes to be exact thank you 😭 So what, he still has 14 years left on his contract. Plenty to criticize about with Chelsea’s transfer but Lavia seems harsh. He’s played one game in one season after getting hurt. It happens. Tbf you can't really classify him as a flop yet, poor lad's just been injured hey he looked good that one time Shame because he was one of the few bright lights when we got relegated, was absolutely  incredible on his day but I have no clue why he decided to go to Chelsea rather than somewhere like Liverpool Yeah. they love paying loads for players who never play. Then they sell them for loads only to rebuy them for even more. It’s a great model really.  Edit: 🎣 As a Liverpool fan, £20m for Endo feels like an absolute steal now. It felt mad at the time, a 30yo, but he's done a great job there and acts as a good placeholder until Bajcetic is over his growth spurt.   Both Caicedo and Lavia were well overpriced, and Caicedo is slowly emerging into a decent player (not £120m worth, though). Lavia has been unfortunate with injuries and could still break through, but I feel like if you're gonna spend big money for a DM, you expect the finished article or at least close (Fabinho, Rodri, Fernandinho etc), either way, big money, you want their best years ready made.  I actually can't believe we were serious for either of them at the prices they went for They gave this man the bidget of a mid-sized country to win L1 most of the time. I did the math a while ago from all the trustworthy sources I found. From sign-on fees to wages, commissions & family bribes (€50mil to his mother) it was to the tune of 570mil euros. That doesn’t include the transfer fee & the commissions on the transfer. My guess is probably because he's born on the 29th of June and although he was announced on the 14th of June 2023, the contract would be signed on the 1st of July which is when the transfer window officially opens. So he would be considered to have signed for Real Madrid just as he turned 20. His transfer was officially done on July 1st, 2 days after his 20th birthday.  But his transfer was already announced 2 weeks prior when he was 19. That's what I was thinking too, but no one else seems to have queried so was wondering if I misunderstood the list! He'd be third, I think One of those players that failed when jumping to the professional level, he was a very huge talent in the youth system but never did anything on the main team. Mendes had some % of his rights so he sold him as quick as possible before he could have more minutes at senior level. People will always say Félix, but Fábio IS the craziest one here. Félix was nothing short of a wonder kid at Benfica and Atlético had to pay the release clause because we didn't want to sell. Fábio Silva was and is a bum. Ouch hadn't realized how badly that had gone Barcelona panic bought Vitor Roque when Madrid signed Endrick and now they want to offload him not even after half a season there. That what Vini & Rodrygo signings did. Roque and Endrick have time to prove themselves. If Martial’s muscles weren’t made of silly string he could have been a great player De ligt was pretty good aswell even if they did overpay mbappe was a performance success but not an actual success, he didnt bring anything to psg that they wouldnt have won without him (João Feliz) I'd say his commercial pull helped bring in a ton of money, in the form of tickets and gear and other ""engagement"" In true joker fashion, it's not about the money  They easily could have sold him for 100M+ when Real Madrid made the offer like 2 or 3 years ago If you account for club popularity and jersey sales, he blew it out of the park. I mean having him on the team is already a win. Imagine how more popular PSG got around the world for Mbappe. Lmao they paid for him to be their star. They didn't cut any losses because they felt they might as well have a go at the Champions League. Almost made it to a final.  Levy valued one more year of Kane at around €99M, and would have let him walk for free afterward. Bayern paid €100M so they got him.  You pay for a players services and only sell when someone is offering more than what you think the rest of his contract is worth. Mbappe puts PSG on the map and casuals know PSG due to Mbappe. Intangible return are pretty hard to quantify but i think overall PSG will see it as a W.  However now that Mbappe is gone, not sure how PSG as a brand is going to continue Oh yea and all those shirt sales, trophies, fans he won for them are worth zilch They're owned by the country of Qatar. If you think €180m is a lot for that country, then you need to research more about their wealth. They're owned by Qatar lmao, having him as the face of PSG (especially before the Qatar WC) was worth far more to them that the financial outlay. Don't forget heavy bonusses for him! Mbappe single handedly put the entire French league on the map.   Before Mbappe people and the media only used to say ""the top 4 leagues"" instead of top 5. Weird. Stagnated, but at a high level if that makes sense. He - thus far - is that regen in football manager that has reached his pa at age 20 (for the FM nerds).  Juventus was an ill-fit for him personally. He became a better defender, but he wants to be able to play the ball as well. At Bayern he's been good, but not outstanding. He's also been struggling with fitness a bit, not helping his case with lots of competition for the center back position.  So still a great center back for any CL level club, but thus far not fulfilling the insane promise he showed at Ajax. Bro cant actually defend  Bunch of people on a subreddit for football fans pretending to not understand what a free transfer is   Its sad ""Free"" [deleted] TIL 130 mil signing fee is fee Felix had a half decent year when they won the title, so it's not all bad I suspect there was a scam orchestrated by Mendez & insiders at Atletico. Maybe one day we’ll know what really happened there. His profile was pretty much the same as Griezmann so what are you even talking about. Atletico needed a creative attacking midfielder, they got one. De Light was just slightly not worthy the price but still a very solid transfer. I'd say Felix is the only undoubtably bad transfer there. De ligt was okay - sold for a 18m euro loss after 3 years. Martial also okay considering his injury issue and the rest are still young. ✅ I would say Martial did if you count ""the hype"" as being from the time in the graphic above. He really wasn't that hyped when the deal happened. The Martial hype that we remember came after his first season. Overall I think you'd take his career for the transfer fee. Not really crazy when you look at how most teenagers never really make it. The crazy thing is clubs gambling huge amounts on them. Martial may not have lived up to his potential, but if you consider injuries, he had a good career. Just a shame he got hindered so much by that. One of the top DM prospects in the world. Sadly for him he got injured, came back to play 32 min then got injured again. It was a gamble though. I remember his first season with us. Benzema was telling his mates not to pass the ball to him. But he was someone else in 2020 onward. These people didn't see him play for Benfica like we did. We've had tons of talented players coming from the academy over the years, Félix was by far the most special. And we’re probably going to sell them for €120mil apiece when their time comes. Thats mostly because there isn’t really much competition. Hes played like 3 friendlies for the Brazilian national team Follow the money. It wouldn't matter. That Monaco team was dismantled. Half  the initial 11 was gone the season Mabppe left and the other half was gone the next season after that.  I think the only good players left were Falcao and the Keeper. Follow the money. Maybe one day we’ll know. How many CL Felix got? - CR7 probably He'll come good for sure Why? He's 19, been at the club for half a season, under a coach who didnt want him. Give him a chance lol No, Mbappe looked much better [deleted] As many as he would have played for Liverpool How is Vini unsportsmanlike? He was fine at Southampton just got injured Didn’t they use the griezmann money In the leaked audios Florentino talks about Mendes and Porto's president fleecing Chelsea for Mourinho and Carvalho, and diverting some money for those transfers to an account in Swizterland.   https://youtu.be/yC-4WZJIN3c?si=rMoeioTLPiN5dkC8  13:29 in the video (but the entire thing is hilarious if you understand some spanish, which is likely if you're from Portugal).  Thats why Florentino doesnt want to do business with Mendes. Funniest thing is Mendes seems to be Barça working closely with Deco. Dude is a leech. Yup, this absolutely never comes close to happening without Mendes involved, certainly presume some shady stuff was involved because Atleti simply does not have them finances for this to make sense (and are generally pretty cheap)  edit: changed with -> without They sorted by potential on sofifa instead of actually watching him play, classic mistake. In the Europa League first leg against Frankfurt he looked like he could become a ballon d'or winner Tbf I was thinking he is the real deal. Looked really good for Benfica and very mature for his age.   Of course the transfer fee was outright dumb af and probably played a role in him bombing like a bitch. Benfica are the masters of extracting an over inflated fee he got a kidney injury in 2015 against bayer leverkusen where he was rushed to the hospital after the game. never allowed himself to recover and would piss blood after every game and training session. that plus depression and years of playing every game meant he was bound to fall off at some point He was still highly rated then but had a poor stint with Chelsea, which may not have all been his fault. He’s now a reserve at Atlético and that’s probably not going to change. Jesus I completely forgot he played for Chelsea. One of those transfers that happened and i’ve just for some reason erased it from my memory future rustic snails toothbrush encourage growth provide teeny hungry dime   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Honestly i felt like Aleti in recent years has been living off the brilliance of Simeone like United those final Ferguson years Neh even without hindsight, a lot of people were calling out the ridiculous fee at the time. The people who defended the move compared him to Griezzman and were sure Simeone would turn him into that type of player for some reason, which is weird because Simeone has only done it with Griezzman so it's not like he has a proven track record of that type of transformation. > Everyone talks about Barca splashing Neymar money on getting Griezzman  But nobody talks about this either, the Neymar money went into Coutinho and Dembele Well, thats cause atletico can actually register their players without needing to do some fraudlent moves like selling fraudulent studios llc to a ghost that will never pay the money. Griezmann joined Barca two whole years after they sold Neymar. Wasn't his agent complaining that he was subbed after 70 min not even 3 months after he arrived? That's a terrible move if you're the new guy, specially at atlético where the most important figure is Simeone. City would never go for Felix. Most of the money came from the grizeman sale iirc Did you forget Barca triggering Griezmann’s €120m clause right before To me the Spanish transfer I can't understand how they got the money was Betis making Denilson the most expensive player in the world. Don't remember them going big on transfers like that any other time I can barely imagine Benfica asking for that much in the first place. No clue why so many of our fans continue to defend him. He was a massive flop but at the end of the day, who cares? We got the money and that’s all that matters Why should Simeone be criticized for Félix flopping? He was injured in training camp, finally got to play, looked great, and then reinjured himself on his first match back What difference would it have made > still  I mean, it isn’t exactly controversial to have that opinion now Don't think add ons are included for the graphic, since Endrick is only listed at 47.5, when I think most stories said the total price was 60m. May be misremembering though Don't think any of the others include unrealised add ons. The idea that a lad who clearly isn't physically cut out for English football getting sent to Scotland to resurrect his career is wild Same as amad diallo, shane duffy, aaron ramsey, jon joe kenny, todd cantwell just to name a few prem players who came up and were utter dreadful He wasn't even good at porto Mendes did us some favours - Neves and Jota in the Championship, Moutinho for £5m - so this was our favour to him. Wolves sold out to Mendes and Mendes, like the devil, come to collect once in a while.  Like when we paid 10m for Bebe to get CR7 to sign an extension. We weren't Which is funny because I learned about Camavinga's existence thanks to the Wunderkind threads from here when he was still 16, been a FM legend for me up until we signed him, I don't think Zidane out of all people didn't knew about his existence back then.  And though yes, we have the pull, sometimes those moves don't work out as we saw with Ødegaard who took time and needed to leave to become amazing or with Reiner who we spent over 20m on him that just straight up didn't worked, so it's either securing a career or missing out on something you might never get back.  I wish we would use more canteranos though. >It is not like players like Rodrygo, Camavinga, Vini and others weren't on the radar of other clubs. It is the fact when Real Madrid comes calling.. Players responds.  The thread about Vinicius signing is 6yo old and you can go and read what it was said about the signing then and now, just like what was being said when Vinicius was universally called ""Reboticius""... Some hindsight talk this is. One of the few that was worth it. People make too much up about footballer inflation, Rooney wasn't a record breaking fee or even the highest that transfer window whereas Mbappe's is still the second highest fee paid ever! There is no way Rooney's payment would be anywhere near it if adjusted. Football inflation hasn’t accounted for a 6x increase in fees. Worth every penny Yeah, obviously this is with hindsight in mind. Definitely a risk what they did with him, but oh boy did it pay off massively Wish my club has that strategy. Not buying mid players and refuse to rebuild properly It's a good strategy. If it works, you get 10+ years of service and almost 4x the value back from transfer fees. Won't have to pay huge salaries at the start aswell. If it doesn't, Brazilian prodigies still have a resale value. Vinicius and Rodrygo have alot of promise and will garner a resale value. No one is giving up kn their career at 22. It’s even more a testament to Real Madrid’s development than their scouting.  Vinicius has gotten so much better.  Do you mean Reinier? He was signed for 25m, I think and he still part of the team. Probably won't make it at Madrid, though, that's true The Reinier transfer is weird even for brazilians no one rated him highly Yeah but it's still better than buying 160 million bums like hazard Pedri at $5mm has the chance to be the steal of the century Yeah I think that was the thought process actually. Because that transfer happened pretty quickly. One day there was rumour that atletico want's to sign him, the other day they bought him. While we're on the subject of high transfer fees. What happened to Lemar? And that huge cash certainly won't help Atleti in a bidding war for player. Everyone know you have vast sum of cold money and will jack up the price like crazy for every player you even have slight interest in. He clearly is talented, he just doesn't have the drive to play tbf  He looks like he can't be bothered and doesn't care whether he fails or not because he's already set for life Even if he did 127m for a 19 year old is beyond dumb. He had barely played over half a single season.  You spend 127m or a current world class player in their prime. Best academy in the world? Damn Too many failures along the way, he can still become just below world class but that wouldn’t justify the initial hype. Almost €2m a minute is impressive Bro replicated Arthur Melo's insane 22/23 season For real. People should stop clowning players who got injured for long. Lavia has time to grow and hope he comes stronger from his injury Exactly Yeah Ik but it's funny to banter chelsea  ‘Getting hurt’ is such a funny way to say being injured He's been injured all season, he may well still thrive at Chelsea once actually able to play TBf I am sure Chelsea planned on him playing more than 32 minutes considering Caciedo was ran into the ground and Enzo was playing injured for half the season. Yeah they have just refused to play him just for a laugh. It's a terrible model and he hasn't just been unlucky with injuries last season. >Caicedo is slowly emerging into a decent player  I know you're a scouser, but this comment just feels so satirical. Almost like you wrote it back in September.   Quite literally one of our best players for the last few months of the season, which just so happened to coincide with our best run of form.  You wont find many Chelsea fans unhappy with the Caicedo transfer now. He's an absolute gem, and still so young. Man, when you put it in that way ...  holy shit. Only most lol, couldn’t even do that right. Atleast he won a World cup when he was player at their club That's a big bidet Obviously they made a lot of money on him but for what he actually accomplished with them, it’s actually terrible transfer You can see the ability is there somewhere but it shows maybe 1 out of every 5 games. Very annoying Endrick was a done move long before Barca went in to sign Roque, the world doesn't revolve around you lol.   You don't see Barca fans saying you guys panic bought Guler cause we wanted him even though that makes a lot more sense and is accurate. Roque is done most likely, there's an endless parade of hype Barcelona youngsters that amount to nothing. Lol martial was always a certified bum. Talented but shit attitude. He was never making it even if he had hamstrings of steel. Man U fans are something else Also PSG without Mbappe these years would’ve been terrible in Europe Madrid offered 200M with add ons. Crazy.. > Almost made it to a final.  They did make it to the 2020 final that they lost 0-1 to Munich. What do you mean almost made a final? They made a final in 2020. That's a very weird lie. Top 5 leagues only started once Messi transferred to PSG I think he can still bench a lot of world class CB's but he just kidna fucked up by going to bayern imo. I think we all thought he was gonna have a guaranteed spot there but his injuries plus bad relations with coaches got him benched and his attitude didnt help. I mean real didn’t give money to psg so no transfer fee= free in that sense obv there’s a signing bonus that goes straight to Mbappe it's free in terms of what psg receives In PSG's eyes it's free. Think that was his point For PSG, he left on a free. It’s a free from PSG’s pov Yeah. But that's not going to go to PSG. Absolutely not. Félix is pure flair and creativity. Slow, no defensive contribution. Griezmann works his ass off. I don't know what Atlético were smoking. Wish he had stayed at Benfica. And he was amazing at Ajax, just didn’t really suite Juve’s style I’d say Martial is arguably the one on this list who is the farthest away from fulfilling his potential considering that he got Ballon d'Or potential shouts. At least the rest still have time to turn around their career. My god, i remembered it was trending and many wrote him off. Crazy what winning trophies change narratives. > keeper  Daniel Subasic I agree with you.. I stand corrected [yes they did](https://talksport.com/football/755184/wolves-signing-fabio-silva-from-porto-club-record-fee-raul-jimenez/) He dribbles and then smiles   Or scores and then *warning* dances Did you watch the CL final? Nah, Atleti used Griezmann, Lucas Hernandez and Rodri's money.  People tend to look at the money spend for Joao like Atleti splashed money that year. In reality the net spend was +70 millions that window after buying Llorente, Joao, Felipe, Lodi Trippier and Hermoso.  The thieves that own Atleti will never spend money on the team. terrible use of that money. at least it got us to win la liga tho All agents are leeches. The only difference between them is their size and how criminal they are.   And apart from being financial criminals, a lot of them are directly or indirectly involved with organised crime gangs.  They need to be completely banned or at the very least very heavy regulated with everything they do made public. They had just sold Griezmann, Hernandez and Rodri for 250m€ Atleti sold for players for 310 millions that window.     And yes, they were cheap even buying Joao. The net spend was +70 millions after buying half a team. A lot of players have singular games where they look that good but you need consistent performances of that level to warrant a fee that large. And he indeed won the Golden Boy which is like the kids version of Ballon d'Or Yeah, playing against a Frankfurt down to 10-men since minute 20.  They still managed to lose that tie and João Félix was completely neutered in the 2nd leg. He failed at Porto academy, he stayed at Benfica for 4 years.  Sure had a good half a season, but c'mon, can't spend that amount for half a season of europa league. In the year he had that sensational Frankfurt game he wasn't even the best goal scorer of Benfica..Seferovic was. It's not really about extracting, we just don't have the need to sell and put high release clauses on our players  Everyone is looking for that unicorn before everyone else gets him, and for teams like Atletico the only chance is to overpay massively and take a gamble, otherwise they risk having teams of higher status pick up the player later  Same thing happened with Enzo, Chelsea offered ridiculous values in the Winter market because if they waited they might've had competition and lost him  It's a dumb business model and I wish it didn't exist either, I'm tired of never keeping our talented players for more than a season, hopefully Neves actually stays this year Oh fuck. I know he has some injury back then but damn, I don't even imagine it to be THAT bad. Can't really blame him for his performance drop then. That’s scary af I don’t think that was it, cause I remember that was like his breakout campaign with that amazing solo goal against Bayern happening in 2016 when Atletí got to the final. His fall off came after that He’s already been told he’s not in the plans for next season iirc Yeah and I talk about them all the time when worst transfers ever comes up in conversation. For a long time coutinho was my pick, although Anthony is up there now. Or “swapping” players like Arthur/Pjanic/Neto/Cilessen I did actually. What a crazy time for transfers Because he spent €127m on a player that flopped? Oh no! Such a situation must have weighed him down so much. I mean, Liverpool isn’t Real Madrid but you can see in this chart that the hit rate for some clubs is much better than others. There is probably a reason for that. RM for example makes their youngsters sit and build muscle for a while before they get a chance to I mean butterfly effect would probably mean he wouldn’t get injured for the whole season I mean hey maybe he's happy with the money, idk Endrick was 35 + 25 with half of the add ons depending on how he does for Palmeiras (games, goals, trophies etc.) and half for Madrid (Golden Boy and Ballon d'Or + the earlier). He activated every clause for Palmeiras, so the current price is 47,5 They’re included for Martial. Same with Roque, reported with addons more than 60M The Martial one is even including the Ballon'dor clause in this... His physicality wasn’t an issue, he just wasn’t very good. Joey Barton was of my favourite ones to watch crash and burn when he came up here saying he’d boss the league etc lol couldn’t happen to a worse human being. Idk what happened with Diallo in Scotland  He did great for Sunderland in the Championship and physicality hasn't been an issue in the appearances he made for United this season. Ramsey was fine when fit (except that penalty), and Cantwell isn’t dreadful just hugely overrated And what a favor he did to himself, of the 40M we only got 25M. Apparently we had to give him some part of Fabio's rights for him to renew. So Mendes had a piece of the pie and it was in his best interest to inflate the value as much as possible. CR7 already left when Bebe was signed. The theory behind his signing was it's a ""thank you"" gift to Carlos Quieroz for helping Nani avoid drug test before the 2010 World Cup. Now that's a name I haven't heard in ages, he's up there with Obertan and Macheda Of course some don't work out, all 3 Brazilians were gambles, two out of three being world class is more than enough.   Saying Odegaard didn't work out when you get 35M for a 3M 16 year old is also disingenuous. As good as he was we've seen plenty of hyped 16 year old amount to nothing. Yeah. But this failed for Reiner.  I don't think he will get even a 5M bid now. If it works you look like Real Madrid, if it doesn't you get constantly clowned like Chelsea. I think part of that is on him though. He got put into the spotlight and got a ton of criticism and was able to grow from it. Many other players would just crumble under that kind of pressure That's a good point, and also a reason why it's sometimes better not to send players out on loan. Fans often see young players get zero minutes and just assume that going on loan is the best option, but even if they don't play, spending day in day out training with the first team is super valuable. None of his loan moves seemed to ever work out for him? Is he truly just shit, or is it an attitude problem? Yeah I think that's the guy - I forgot his name. And transfermarkt have it at 30m euros Wasn’t Lucas Silva and Tobias make the list too? He was the best player on his age group and a good squad piece at age 17 for Flamengo, the kid was really good and had/has big potential, but he's on the same boat that Gabriel Barbosa is, his main position doesn't exist for European football. I wonder if he had the same agent as either of the other two. Sounds strange Well he wasn't a bum when they spent 160m on him Injuries. Man is a brilliant player who can't stay fit. Lemaradona is injured.  He's a key player when fit. His injuy record also didn’t help. Felt like every time he would hit a good stretch of form for Atleti, in which he really looked like he was living up to his potential, he would get injured soon after and need a lot of time to regain his form, or even just his minutes. Maybe it also affected his attitude and motivation. I mean Benficas academy has been the most profitable in the world for some time now. In the last ~10 years I would classify the following Benfica academy products as very good or elite: Bernardo Silva, Florentino Luís, João Félix, João Cancelo, Gedson Fernandes, Rúben Dias, Gonçalo Ramos, Renato Sanches, João Neves, António Silva, Gonçalo Guedes, Jota and Ricardo Horta.  Then we also had a good number of second tier talents: Tomás Araújo, Tiago Gouveia, Paulo Bernardo, Tomás Tavares, Nuno Tavares, Hélder Costa, Ivan Cavaleiro, André Horta, Fábio Cardoso, etc. Many of these had good careers in top5 leagues or big clubs from smaller leagues.  Not sure if “best”, top3 or wtv, but definitely up there. Benfica having one of the absolute best academies is surely just a widely accepted fact?   Them, Barcelona, River Plate, Ajax etc etc so he's a *really* expensive prostitute been Injured Doubtful. Chelsea have plenty of other options in Lavia's position, and that's before they inevitably buy new players for the coming season. Nah I wrote it now, and as I previously said, he's slowly emerged into a decent player. It took him half a season but he's getting there. After Cole he's definitely been the most influential player for yous, and while I don't think he is or will ever be worth 120 I do see a bright future for the lad, and you stole Palmer so swings and roundabouts I guess.   Lavia is a headscratcher, though. Still not seeing Enzo's pricetag either yeah definitely the worst transfer on there, spent more than half a billion to win what they would have already won anyway, be just as mediocre in the champions league as before, not to mention those rafaeles that qatar bought from france to persuade macron to persuade mbappe to stay Calling him done after half a season in Europé in which he wasn't even given a proper chance isn't fair. Nor is using failed youngsters against him fair either when we have countless who made it. >Roque is done most likely  Said the Nostradamus, that didn't watch 1 minute of Vitor Roque playing, to come to that conclusion. LOL. The guy was talented but injury prone. Wheres the lie? They would have just bought somebody else, so that's not how it works imo They were terrible even with him Getting eliminated in the round of 16 or 8 most of the time while being pot 1 with a 1 billion team, is not a good performance Have they been good?   It's PSG. It's win the final, or it's a failure.   Mbappe has gotten them nothing that they couldn't have gotten without him. By didn't cut any losses I mean this past transfer window. They could have got something for him, it just wouldn't be enough to get someone better for one year You must be very young if you dont remember every record being titled ""in the top 4 leagues"". You cant be serious psg had already reached a CL final before that lol Yeah but it’s not a free from real Ballon d’Or shouts as an argument? It’s outrageous to call that for a teenager, no matter how good he is. Saying he’s far away from fulfilling potential when he’s been very injury prone and still having scored 90 goals is a wild take. Respect! But I mean... 40M on an unproven (in europe atleast) teenager, for a club who are in deep financial trouble... Doesn't look good haha, so you were definitely on to something. But lets see how he develops Winning the league after losing those caliber of players is a seriously insane achievement. That’s why Atleti can’t compete as of late Four** lil bro He looked amazing at Benfica and in the academy. He surely was exceptional. He is the living proof thats not the case Aye like mudryk for example Sure but you’re taking the bet that he can grow to do that consistently, if you waited on young guys until they were already fully proven the fee would be astronomically larger. Look at the list of golden boys winner and tell me it's even comparable to Ballon dor in this context That’s true but during that „era” every team was looking for his „Ronaldo/Messi” type of wonder, and Felix suited that scenario in that moment. Chelsea says hold my beer If you kept thinking like that then you would sit back and miss out on all the other wonderkids like vini rodrygo endrick haaland bellingham wirtz musiala. I'm sure you laughed at dortmund spending on some league 1-2 kid too but look at the profit they made Portuguese teams finessing other teams kinda crazy he didn’t fall off then. he kept playing thru that kidney injury for years which eventually led to his decline Hazard was worse if you include his wages, but Florentino runs a tight ship so Madrid could afford to lose that money without affecting their finances. ""QUIEN ES DOUGLAS?"" Lives rent free in my head, I swear to this day I still don't know what he looks like. Ah, the ""take a new credit card to pay the old one"" strategy And it wasn't just Griezmann either. Atlético also got 70 and 80 mil by selling Rodri and Hernández earlier that summer. It was the board's decision not him. He was literally hurt the whole time it’s not like when he played he looked bad he can’t even get fit He has literally been injured. Unfair to judge he’s on about 70k a week while he was on about 38k at Southampton. He most likely would’ve been on the same money at Liverpool From a Man Utd fan no less… >He activated every clause for Palmeiras  He's so fucking good. Please take care of him 😭 There is also the tax Wasn't Martials total fee was up to roughly 80m Euros though right? this is 60m euros not GBP.  from a reddit thread at the time of the transfer: ""Confirmed Fee: €50m(£36m), plus €30m addons"" You could tell he was technically very good. But he never seemed to make a big impact on games. Felt the same about Lammers, who then seemed to score goals for fun when we loaned him out, though maybe that was our fault for not playing him as an outright striker.  Going back to Silva, feel he has to really up his off the ball movement if he's going to be a success through the middle. And if he wants to be a success on the wing he needs to up his defensive work rate. Tbf I think it's both He was bullied at celtic park and was subbed at half time. 10M went to Silva's dad.  He's effectively costing us £7M per year with amortization, we need to convince some poor fool to spend more than that this summer so we can get rid of the stroppy little child for good Pretty sure Fergie never saw any footage of him either when we signed him. At least Macheda gave us *that* goal against Villa It's a drop in a bucket for a big club. There's no transfer strategy that warrants a 100% success rate. I'd argue what hurts the Reinier value is that he's not an out and out forward or an out and out midfielder. Clubs don't take risks on those sort of players because most teams do not employ formations suited to those players. Reiner… right here, right NOW?? The good thing is that you don't need every single one to hit for that policy to succeed. Whereas buying older established stars at high prices, you really want them all to meet expectations. Reiner flopping is easier to deal with than Hazard flopping. Chelsea throwing them out on loan so that other teams develop them for them is what's wrong with their approach. How many do they have on loan across the entire European continent? Exactly, I’d rather have Guler and Endrick learn from Modrić and Mbappe/ Vini than go out on loan at any other club. Someone who watched him more closely in Brazil can correct me if I'm wrong, but apparently for Flamengo, he excelled in a role that doesn't really exist in Europe (or at least no team has deemed him good enough to give him the same role) and hasn't been able to adapt. He's very talented, with words saying he's actually much more talented than Vini and Rodrygo and was very mature. But he couldn't make that next step from Brazil to Europe.  Part of that is our fault. He played for Castilla (our youth team) for a bit and he looked good. Then we loaned him out to Dortmund of all places who refused to give him much play time (idk if it was because he was a loan player or if he was just shit) and then he proceeded to rot on the bench instead of us recalling him and sending him out. When his loan finally ended, we then loaned him out somewhere else and he still didn't play that much football.   Compare that to Vini and Rodrygo who played in the youth team then got minutes in the first team Silva was bought back in 2015 or 16 for under 15m. He was always a punt but it didn't work for a lot of reasons (health being a factor too). Tobias was on loan in Castilla for 2 years but he's going back to Shaktar now. Both didn't work out but neither was a heavy investment tbh What position/role is is that? That's hardly the issue with Gabigol If people are gonna mention the risk of 18 yr old signings, might aswell also mention how the other strategy of buying a slightly older proven forward at 28y for 4x that value turned into. Also, Jovic who had done it in Europe and if you went by conventional thought process would be preferred because he was already performing in Europe ahead of those Brazilians. He is never worth that price. While their academy is great and certainly one of the best in the world. Being the most profitable doesn't make it the best as teams like Barca have incredible academies, but just don't sell the players who come out of it nearly as often. It's even debatable if it's the best of Portugal...  The national team spine is still Sporting If you last longer than 10s. Well most of the money went to the former pimp though It’s always a Liverpool fan who has to pipe up about Lavia.   I’m interested to see what does happen if he ever gets to fitness. He has that connection with Maresca from the City PL2 squad and seems ideal for the deep lying playmaker the Maresca system uses.   He will have plenty of minutes rotating with Enzo and Caicedo. Plus we’ve not been linked with any CMs > Chelsea have plenty of other options in Lavia's position  Who pray tell? Covid league final Yes but in terms of signings that this post is about he is moving on a free.   In future threads where this topic comes up it is not a 130M transfer is it? If it were then all the numbers would need to be adjusted similarly.  It’s a free transfer. Yea. Not free for Real.  But he is leaving for free from PSG after they spent 180M for him when he was a teenager. Oh My God, everyone knows that, why are you guys making it such a big deal? lmao. So antagonist for no reason lol I mean, what are we discussing here? Ask any United fan, they'd feel pretty underwhelmed with Martial's career at United compared to his initial hype. The 60M pricetag shown here is also inclusive of all add-ons, most of which I'm sure he did not accomplish. He's far from a bad signing despite how everything turned out. Especially when you look at how much we've spent on Antony, Sancho, Maguire and Casemiro since. Yes it was.  The key factor for that title was having players with a massive chip on his shoulder all at once. People like Llorente, Trippier, Carrasco and Suárez gave his 100% and something more that season. They like chollonges I heard Academy? Bro. well thats just being pedantic innit? A team could pay 120m for a 2nd division player, doesn't mean the player is 120m quality. Just that the team was willing to pay that much who knows why. Which part? Than 127 million euros? Back then?    Bellingham cost less ffs  Remember this was in 2019, Eden hazard and Antoine griezmann were sold in the same window for less money than Felix. Even if he had become world class he still might not have fetched the same fee they paid for him. Not in his case. The fee already was astronomically large And during that era it was hip to Shell out ridiculous sums and get nothing in return So many bad examples, none of those had a 120M first transfer, especially after failing before and get a free transfer just 3 years before.  Haaland was bought by... 8M, then 20M, then 60M  Bellingham was bought by 30M...  Wirtz 200k  Musiala 200k  All of them have proved something after this transfer, way more than Félix in his half a season where he only played one game in Champions league... People gonna disagree with me just cause of the flair and all but Hazard was definitely a worse signing on paper and as a player. Although overall I would say Coutinho was worse cause it was a big part in leading our club to financial crisis Kerlon, Henrique, even Paulinho were shady deals Infinite money! Yeah I’m sure he had zero say or sway Takes one to know one eh How do u rate Willian? Interested to know That's bs, it was nowhere close to 80. There were 3 add-ons. League goals, caps for France, and the Ballon d’Or. I've just looked at that dude's numbers, and in conclusion, it's fair to say he should never have left the Netherlands It's amazing how top football clubs are essentially held together by a few bits of string. Like Roy Hodgson accidentally selling Alex Kačaniklić to Fulham as part of the Konchesky deal, when he thought he'd Alex Cooper. And nobody thought to check! Yup. And he hasn't been successful in his loan spells too as he would have to change his style of play to accommodate to most. But teenagers are orders of magnitude riskier, it kind of feels insane that Vinicius hadn't even had first team minutes and Madrid had already bought him, hindsight can tell us they were incredibly lucky.  Looking at the list, there's more flops than hits, even if we're being generous and we assume the jury is still out on a couple of them (De Ligt, Roque). Are we really doing this?! A loan to Arsenal? Wouldn't be the worst of the ideas tbh. There was Lucas Silva too Yeah thats true.  But if it's a big signing like Mbappe or sort, it won't be bad even if it's a flop after high profile signing. He is gonna get back the amount in less than a year. But Hazard wasn't exactly that either. Still weird to think that Real spend 100M and put up very easy clauses (rather than performance based) for a Hazard who had like 1 year left in his contract. Not many since Boehly took over Also someone can correct me on this if it's bs, but I swear I read somewhere when the club decided to send him to another club on loan after his failed 1st season at Dortmund, he refused to do so and wanted to stay. Even his loan to Girona was his choice. So I really don't know what is going on and how much blame is on him. I wish him the best but it seems like he's going back to Brazil, he just might not be built for European football. Reinier is done too I guess? He can’t make the squad I believe. How are players like Paz and the Puerto Rican dude? He's a second striker, he needs that freedom to roam around and be as close to the ball as he can to be able to play it well  He's not good enough to make anyone change their system to fit him, could see him working out on that Firmino role, but I wouldn't expect it About 50% of transfers work out. But when you consider potential development that amount drops further. 18 year old vini was terrible, took him a little while to grow into the player he is today. When you look at all the griezzman, dembele, Felix & Coutinho transfers around that time he certainly was. Not good for me then 10 seconds would still be €333k so still extremely expensive Thats not the point but I see youre not a logical being so have a nice day I replied to a comment that doesn’t mention transfer. That’s what I’m pointing out. It’s not free You’re the one getting annoyed by a simple comment lol Yeah, in the Benfica youth squads. What do you call it in English? >you need consistent performances of that level to warrant a fee that large. Hazard on paper was an absolutely fantastic signing though   He was in his prime   Had a remarkable season and was primed to be the star at real.   It turned out to be awful but on paper it was going to be great At least paulinho was decent on the pitch I miss Paulinho he was actually good If you want to have a dig at Cholo it's fine, it's just not that way to do it. There is a club hierarchy to make decisions like that, Cholo is neither the chief scout, the sporting director, the club president nor the club owner. Bro please stop embarrassing us Do you mean Estevão? Because he goes by the first name here haha. He just turned 17 and he looks more ready than Endrick was at this point last year. Endrick was sacked from the starting eleven deservedly so and only came back doing what we imagined he was capable of at the end of the season. Meanwhile Estevão has been playing minutes regularly since april and going really well. He plays a bit further away from the goal, but he creates a lot of opportunities for himself and others. I think he has a bright future ahead and hope he does really well, but I think Endrick is more Europe ready because he's built like a tank, Estevão is really skinny and will need to gain some muscle for sure. well feel free to prove it, everything from the time says 50+30. I wasn't saying the addons weren't a thing either lol.  like it was famously repeated that he was an 80m transfer (unfairly including the addons) this isn't new ground.  It was literally confirmed by the VP of Monaco. The exchange rate in 2015 matches up with that figure.  https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9976968/manchester-united-trebled-offer-for-anthony-martial-within-a-week moral of the story - don't buy hype players from Netherlands league - Antony, Bergwijn... I hope he comes back to Flamengo on this mid year tranfers window. Some rumours, begun last month, that our VP of football was looking for a 1 year loan.  He seemed so talented when he played for us, that i still believe he can make a good career on Flamengo.  But you're right, he shined as a second attacker, which is a position that european clubs don't use at all. And with Jorge Jesus, that seems to make mid players, play above of what they're used to do. I hope that Tite can do that too. It was more a reference from Attack on titan I think haha 1 year left thing meant nothing, because Hazard was going to renew if Madrid didn't offer fair price to Chelsea. Also Hazard was a fantastic signing at that point. A big thing for us is that we treated him differently to Vini and Rodrygo. When he wasn't getting minutes at Dortmund we should have immediately pulled the plug and brought him back and sent him somewhere else. But instead he stuck with keeping him there public tap touch noxious far-flung fanatical tart plough important straight   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* What is Reiniers’ position? I guess you were talking Barbosa? He wasn't terrible. What the fuck? If Real Madrid would've not went for him, some other club would've for more than that. He was not plucked out of obscurity, Real Madrid just moved in faster and had the prestige that others didn't. Vinicius had 3.87 dribbles p/90 in his first season and was the main creator and driver of attacks under Solari. ""Terrible"", I don't think you saw any Vinicius in his first years. No need to feel shameful. Just enjoy those 6 sec To Donald Trump it wouldn’t be Well no player plays for free. So it’s a strange thing to point out. If someone moves from Düsseldorf to St. Pauli at the end of their contract no one says well actually it costs X.  Madrid out bid everyone on wages same as every other similar transfer aha Lots of players are fantastic in the academy but can't take the next step. Felix was an overpay, with and without retrospect  Thay don't. Who needs an academy if you can be last in the league and still have like 60mln for transfers Maybe I should have said deserve not warrant Is a hotdog valued at $15 if one idiot buys one? No “Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev has revealed Manchester United almost trebled their offer for Anthony Martial within a week, and has confirmed that the total value of the transfer could reach nearly £58m” where is 80 coming from????😂 Suarez... It's not like psv bought him. He left because his loan there ended Yeah. I also think it's good he goes back to flamengo. I don't think a loan would be possible now though as he has 1 year left on his contract iirc. Oh. My bad. Spending 100M on hazard with 1 year left was bongers. A 70 M was the ideal price for him with hard to get performance based add-ons. Hazard was also 29 at the time, not 25 or younger.  We wouldn't be talking about this if it didn't became the worst signing maybe in the history of club football, but that signing was going in the wrong manner from the beginning. Thank you for the correction, much appreciated! Did you see him play for Real Madrid? Benzema famously said how Vinicius was playing against them. I’m not saying he wasn’t a hot talent, but if he was still as good as he was back then he would be on loan somewhere. He developed, that’s the point. Not everyone does & it’s hard to predict who will develop well That’ll be 200k please It’s not strange. I’m just clarifying the situation He was a similar buy to vini rodrygo endrick martial, and dare i say mbappe from monaco to psg. They all had at most one successful top flight season and then were scooped up at a high price. He just ended up not being a success, which is the assumed risk when clubs make these gambles. It was an overpay, yes, but at the time it made some sense because he looked like he could become as good as kaka/hazard in his position Not without retrospect, we could just as easily be talking about it having paid off, nowadays Coming from a Chelsea fan you know that it’s a serious overpay.. But a large part of any fee for a young player is potential. Clearly he hasn't proven value for money but that is in part due to him failing to reach that potential. Did he have enough potential to warrant that fee? I don't think so but others seem to. Ironic coming from someone with a Wrexham flair. I mean yeah that’s how the market works. If people are buying it for a price, that’s what it’s worth? Otherwise what’s your threshold? 2 idiots? 10? Have you even been to a sporting event? Do you not understand what exchange rates are? are you really that stupid? The euro to gbp rate has changed since 2015... 80 is in euros as well (the chart being discussed is in euros)  to be clear for you seeing as you're slow, in 2015;  £36m is roughly 50m euros initially £58m is roughly 80m euros total Ronaldo Nazário, R9 Madrid could have offered 70M but Chelsea simply wouldn't have sold him. And Madrid desperately needed a leader for the attack after the disaster of 2018-19 and nobody could have predicted that Benzema would go on to become that leader. I have seen Vinicius and Real Madrid in every game for the last 5 years. He was already the full package in the things you can't learn and just needed improvements in finishing which is the aspect most tricky dribblers are not good at from the start. Benzema's comments prove nothing other than a mid-game frustration.    What was wrong with Vinicius was the system and Zidane wanting to limit his freedom and creativity because he was more pragmatic and wanted the team defensively assure. Did you know Zidane started Vinicius at RWB against Chelsea in one of his final games? It took a month with Carlo Ancelotti for Vinicius to start registering upwards of 20G and 20 assists and it's not because he learnt that shit in a month. Few tactical tweaks, telling him what runs to make, playing him a little closer to the goal, giving him confidence to use his dribbling ability to create havoc and Vinicius was off to the racers. But we’re talking about transfer fees in this thread all the way, not wages etc… and your comment was ‘it’s not a free from Real’.  Which in terms of transfer frees etc it is definitely a free, everyone understands Real aren’t getting Mbappe for free in totality, which is why I say it was a strange thing to point out.  Maybe we’re just misunderstanding eachother which is fine, hope you’re having a good night! Vini, Rosrygo, Endrick were like 1/3 his price. I agree Joao would be reasonable buy at that price, even a steal when you take potential into account. Similar with Martial who was bit of an overpay but still less than half of Joao.  I dont buy comparison to Mbappe. Mbappe was different than anyone mentioned here, even if he never improved on his Monaco season he would be a good deal for PSG. It was just an incredibly poor piece of business by Atletico, because he is such a wildly different type of player than what they had their team built upon.   It's like they thought about reinventing the club's philosophy / identity but pulled out half way through. The Felix that came out of Benfica could hardly find a worse top tier club to develop into an established top tier player. Da fak has a fair to do with this? If you prefere I can have a Botafogo one or something else. I just love how people here, when having nothing to say, go with ""ironic with a flair like that"" Eh. If I'm selling hotdogs and one dude pays $15 but nobody else is paying close to that then the value of my hotdogs aren't $15. I can overpay for whatever but if I can only sell it for less... Chelsea would have sold him for 70-80. And there was no need to add ridiculously simple clauses on top of that. And Benzema wasn't bad in the 18/19 season iirc. Had 40 G+A or something.  The point is he was not a greatly marketable star, had 1 year left in his contract, and was 29 years old. That was 3 red flags for a 100M offer. But Perez wanted him here and you know what happens if Perez wants a thing. Okay seems I touched a nerve. The point is you buy young players for their potential, not who they are today. And they don’t all reach that potential. That’s a risk. I replied to a person not talking about transfers. If Chelsea would have sold him for that, then Madrid wouldn't offer more ya know? And it was hard to guess Benzema would continue his form because that came after two very poor seasons. It was simply that Chelsea had more bargaining power in that situation because Hazard was willing to extend contract with them.     What madrid could have done I guess is look for other players too instead of going all in on Hazard. But at that point Hazard was looking like a balon-d-or winner level player, so Madrid took the chance. But none could have guessed it would go down as the worst transfer ever.   If you wanna talk about red flag transfer, then it was more the Jovic one. A player who only performed for one season and before that failed in his previous club was signed with a huge salary. Rumor wise he was getting paid more or on par with Benzema. My man the person you replied to said ‘he’s leaving on a free (transfer) in his prime’.  You said, it’s not free Real are paying 130M.  I have previously explained twice that maybe you didn’t know the (transfer) part, so I added in and told you.   I can not explain it any simpler than that. The entire thread is about transfers. Chelsea would have sold but hazard himself wanted a higher package for his club. Madrid does that.  Jovic was also a big red flag. Just came into the scene and he was bought unlike the recent young signings who were touted become top players from their young days itself. You literally just added transfer lol. Even you know I’m right and you’re just changing the statements Not really No im trying to say that want the person meant was a free transfer, which I explained with my replies.  You know what dude, I retract my good night, I hope you are just having an average night 😂😂😂 what a nuissance! Yes, really. No you’re changing what they said to fit something that you’re thinking. You’re just adding stuff to create confusion lol No. Not really Yes, the entire thread is literally about transfers. Including the comment you were responding too, which was talking about free transfers. Not really though Read the thread again mate. Literally is."

Lord what a nightmare ish signing for us Lukaku collecting Italian teams like infinity stones oh my god we are finally free of his torment That's as good as one could ask for given the situation “Brokered by Ali Rabat for Epic Sports”🔥🐐  Build him a statue At this point Lukaku should have started a travel blog end of an error. i used to pray for times like this Chelsea are truly the most elite team in the entire history of football at selling players, it has to be black magic. kiss the badge! ""Permanent transfer brokered by"" is code for ""The person in my DMs constantly updating me was"" We are free at last!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭 Throwback to his insane debut against Arsenal. He absolutely toyed with Pablo Mari in that game. I saw a hilarious comment that he used Mari as his own personal offside tool lmao.   His touch was good and his runs were sharp. He wss drawing Arsenal players to him and just shrugging them off. Reece James played really well in that game, for some odd reason its really the only game I saw Reece feed those direct through balls through to Rom properly (odd moments in other games aside, like Villa)   I really thought we had solved our striking problems and he was going to kick on. It all went downhill so fast a month in.  The reverse fixture, Arsenal completely dealt with him iirc and he looked invisible. His 2nd debut was definitely his best game for us.   Insane fee that said. But man what could have been if Tuchel had both wingbacks fully fit that season for a bit longer… Chelsea are now in net profit this window lol Thank fuck He's going to outlast Conte again! Chelsea's ability to sell deadwood is unreal; I wish we could do that too.   Doesn't matter that the transfer fee was big, that the player is on high wages, his age, mentality, or that the whole world knows they're desperate to sell, they'll still find someone willing to spend the money anyway  Ngl I'm now fully expecting Sterling to leave despite how impossible it initially looks €45m is wild Chelsea working the magic in the market again. Genius. WHAT A FUCKING DEAL! THANK GOD Just jumped for joy in a Target. this transfer is sponsored by GEICO - save more on car insurance Finally. Now we wait for him to do a slag us off interview as soon as the move is done. Can't wait for his ""Napoli was my childhood dream club"" speech  Solid sale given there was like no market for him Napoli got fleeced but Conte was obsessed with him Lets GO! What a beautiful story finally Lukaku can play for his favorite childhood club. Another homegrown academy product to add to the graphic from yesterday gtfo Name a more iconic duo than big rom and senile conte Is lukaku now the player with most combined transfer fees? Maybe it still is neymar but lukaku must be close to 300m in combined fees. How? We sell good... OH MY GOD HOW HAHHAHAHA What happens with Osimhen now Inter Milan, Roma, Napoli.. Italy de Tour! BEST TRANSFER WINDOW.  EVER. Napoli will sell him in 18 months for 20 ar least WE'RE FREE Ok but Chelsea please don't sign Osimen Kind of curious what the balance ended up being for Lukaku - I guess in terms of Transfer fee paid minus loan fee 1 minus loan fee 2 - minus this Napoli sale  Then I guess you’d have to factor in the wages spent and/or split  Is it possible Chelsea has managed to salvage like 60 million back out of the whole 100 million dollar man venture? Thank goodness it’s finally over Get in everyone! Bohely adding sell on clause is genius, knowing that he will move to his next boyhood Italian club in 2025 HALLELUJAH Thank God it's over   He's gonna cook in Napoli tho, watch the world forget this transfer saga after next season That is a crazy fee to get rid of a player Chelsea didn't want to keep Thank God the cunt is finally gone LMAO HOW What's the funniest outcome of this I hate this here we go shit Damn, 60 million pound realized loss ( probably less when factored in loanning fee) 30m for Lukaku is a steal. He's still a world class striker. There goes Chelsea's best striker >brokered by Ali Barat for Epic Sports  At least try and hide it bro😭😭 Good luck rom , give them hell Conte got his guy Does this mean Oishemen is on the move? Kisi ek ka toh hoja bhai Not official until the “ There we land” The Gilmour/Lukaku combo alive again. Wait, did they play together? Surely at some point 😂 i don't understand why anyone would pay a fee for him We've all seen the movie before. Year one is good, second year when things go south, Conte is gonna throw a hissy fit. A bum with a big mouth. I genuinely forgot he was still a Chelsea player The plus 15m is if he stays a whole season? That Late 2021 interview where he talked about Tuchel and missing Inter set off a chain of events none of us would have ever seen coming...   He started off so good at Chelsea...    And wouldn't you know... He's back with Conte.... What will happen to Osimen? Up to 45m 💀 It seems like he's played for so many Italian teams but Napoli will only be his third Serie A team after Inter and Roma. I mean yea not many have played for 3 but it doesn't seem thaaaat much either. He finally gets to join his dream club In 10 years the Big Rom documentary will be interesting lol Next one is Milan then? Juve can be ticked off since he wanted to join them after the loan in Inter.  ""It's my boyhood to play for the biggest **clubs** in Italy."" Unless that 15 include being top scorer in the Champions League this year (we are not in), not a chance ADL agreed to that.  Other sources mentioned 30+ plus a % on resale (which is equally weird). Damn...  up to 45m for him? Nobody wanted him and should've made much better deal. Y'all need to stop with comments. I can't upvote them all Another badge to kiss for romelu On my knees in M&S Straight up just touring Italy at this point So is Osimhen leaving or is Lukaku just going to chill on bench? Almost 45mil for this lad at this age is mad... wtf.... I fully expect Lukaku the second he leaves italian football for good to say he hates italy and their food is overrated. Conte wanted him bad! Else the most Chelsea could possibly get was €25m + €5m.   Most neutral fans would agree with me. Tbf, he’s had a fantastic scoring record for literally every team bar Chelsea and a single small stint with United (which otherwise wasn’t even that bad).   Can’t blame him for being keen to live in Italy either. Everyone out here making deals while Juve keeps trying to get some youngsters on loan with option to buy. Pain So Osimhen > PSG? €45mln for Lukaku is a scam ffs Man finally got his dream move to ~~Inter~~ Napoli Conte would've left Napoli by the end of the year if they didn't get him, they've played the last 2 games without a proper threat in the box and have looked dreadful. Anguissa is the guy who got great chances last match and missed all of them. Conte looked depressed last match, now he's got his joy back. Whoooooo..... Soon to be announced…still has some unfinished business at Chelsea. Chelsea to buy him back next year after he has a big season with them for 60 mil. you brought him in for 115m and now you're selling him for 30m  the American financial math will somehow spin this into a positive net flow 60M transfer back to Chelsea 2025 summer Might as well be the worst signing in the history of the sport The funny thing from all this is that Lukaku is the answer to Chelsea's problem. I have never understood. Is Rommie Lụkæku a good player or a meme? How long before he’s out at Napoli? July 1, 2025  >@ChelseaFC Welcome Home, Romelu! #lukakuisback as a reward or as punishment Serie A: can we do 3yr loan w/option to buy They basically do? tbf you would be set for life as an agent of basically any single client in the top 5 leagues It started so well too.  That season we were supposed to challenge Liverpool and City at the top, and through the first few weeks that looked like what was about to happen.  And then Reece got sent off against Liverpool and it's been downhill ever since. all he had to do was stfu. I remember his first few matches with you he scored some goals and then he had a bad run of games and he ruined it all Has to be the worst ever. Dashed hopes, trapped in the contract, multiple betrayals by the player, the annual loan to Italy... There’s two ways of looking at it:  One which is as you said a total nightmare. For everything the happened. Just a monumental waste of money. Tuchel wouldn’t use him properly and then he got fed up and did that stupid interview and everything got worse from that moment on. Total mistake.   The other way of looking at it is, still objectively the right transfer to make. In that moment. At that time. The feel good of winning the Champions League had us thinking other ambitions. Winning the league felt attainable for the first time since 2017. All we needed was the 30 goal a season striker who always said he had unfinished business at Chelsea, the club he grew up supporting. It was either that or hold out for the Haaland pipe dream the next year. And we needed something NOW.   Both POVs are right and it’s just super unfortunate that it wound up how it wound up. Also super unfortunate is that Inter offered more up front a year ago which we were presumably ready accept until they found out he was negotiating with Juventus in secret How is he still worth so much money? 😭 United fans already warned you all about this https://i.imgur.com/4ieSicM.jpeg So bad you signed him twice. Three times the charm? Watch him become the top scorer in Serie A. Still: 45 million for Lukaku right now is good work. I mean isn’t worth that anymore. The guy was a nightmare for United. No idea how Chelsea seen that and paid more than we did... He is the worst signing in PL history let alone for us He's using badge kisses as cover for looking at his kit in order to remember the team he's playing for this week. AC Milan next Sadly Juventus didn't want to be part of it Monza in 5 years.  Como in 8 years? One English Fist, One Italian Fist. War is over I am genuinely so happy right now He will return, like Joao Felix. For now same, Conte would've actually died without him For now You bought felix, mudryk and sterling. Lukaku's the least of your problems. Another thing to add to Conte’s legacy Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul type beat Romano plugging agents haha This guy is more powerful than Jorge Mendes but most people don’t know him The next stage is acknowledging agents when their player scores goals. Epic Sports > Epic Games Well at least we know Antwerp, Brussels, London,Liverpool, Manchester, Milan, Rome, Napels and to top it off Birmingham As a concept it was such a beautiful idea. The team we had around lukaku at the time was so well balanced, the full backs, the defense, the control in midfield. What a disaster it's been Thanks to Papa Conte! It's fucking insane. They stole our youth player on a free and sold him for like 25 million in 6 months. They are sacrificing youth players to some Satan god its the only explanation. Our academy alone has outsold Arsenal and Newcastle along with many others since 2014 💀 Came to write this, as Romano as it gets with explicitly naming his source lol It's clearly a paid for advert by the agent. There's Kepa and Sterling still... He used Mari as a stripper pole that game ffs, feels like it happened ages ago but it's not even that long ago. This is madness No way we are, even if you count Broja for 30m and full fee for Lakaka, we'd still be like 25m short You have to hand it to them. They play some mediocre football, but they have mastered unloading unwanted players. According to transfermarkt even when including lukaku they aren't? How? Our ability to buy deadwood is the only thing that can match it. For a 31 year old on 300k/week that Chelsea was desperate to get rid off.  Auba was a similar situation and Arsenal had to pay him to leave. United got less for Greenwood They can't keep getting away with it! Just saw someone jump for joy in a Target. Until he mentions he wants to go back to Inter Not really fleeced. Lukaku’s an idiot but he's a very good forward. He had a good season with Roma and is proven in Italian football. This would only the second time Conte has managed Lukaku Big Daddy with his big baby Rom Think Neymar is still just ahead, since the Saudi transfer was a lot of money. But I think there's a chance for Lukaku to reclaim it when he moves on from Naples Morata's still up there too, isn't he? Maybe we do a loan with option that easily turns into obligation with appearances Probably on the bounce He’s coming chels on deadline day Thought you wanted a striker, not interested? Nothing yet. He doesn't want a loan and to reduce his salary. Likely to Saudi after the European Market is closed. PSG hated him, Premier League teams don't want to touch that expensive hot mess so is either Saudi or out for the rest of the year. not the most reliable but Di Marzio said Napoli offered sell-on on him, lol Missed medicals Daddy Conte texts him “thanks for the seasono” next June. Napoli sack Conte a few games in and bring in Tuchel Conte resigns due to lack of signings forces a move to AC Milan in a years time Lukaku scoring 6 against the snake club next year (not this year, obviously, Napoli's not in Europe). Fax machine 🅱️roke Maybe on paper but the dude was never going to play for the club again after what he did. O' Semen Going to chelsea probably Plus like ~20 million in loan fees so it defff could be worst. I am just glad him and his wages are gone honestly Book value was £37m, + being free of his wages Yes yeah if as an agent you make 10% commission from even the Mbappe transfer from Monaco to PSG  or Pogba from Juve to Man Utd  that's 18 million euros or 10.5 for Pogba  even that one transfer alone is enough for an agent to retire and never have to work again  even on 5% commission its still more than enough, most people never make that much money in their entire lives Bilbao Players: 🗿 Nah it wasn't that game. It was Chilwell and Reece getting injured at the same time vs Juventus. >And then Reece got sent off against Liverpool and it's been downhill ever since.  Think we were top of the table in November tbf The Liverpool 1-1 when Reece got sent off unironically was the game I thought we would challenge for the title. Such a fantastic defensive display. It's the Juve game that killed the season, alongside Lukaku being a tit. Winning a Champions League while going downhill with no brakes is impressive I remember eagerly awaiting Lukaku v Van Dijk. I was at the Villa game, which was his other good game directly after the Arsenal match.  The whole stadium was chanting his name, I had a couple of older ladies next to me in their 70’s who were season ticket holders absolutely belting his name out.  … and then it all fell apart. At that moment I thought we’re going to win the league. Hahah. Competing with Pool and the Cheaters? Chelsea fans have always been delusional and daft. 🤣🤣 He got injured tho. You have to thank city's finest Ake for absolutely murdering his ankle for no reason except that he couldn't defend him The match against Arsenal where he bullied Mari and the rest of the bench warmers really made it seem like he was the boss striker of the Prem. At least Sheva and Torres tried when they played and didn't do bonkers ass interviews. They were just expensive flops. I remember Morata going through personal things and all the loaners we had never reached thier potential. rich clubs fighting over their most expensive flops but I still maintain Antony will be the worst-ever signing for a long time on the grounds we paid an outlandish fee for a player that had never shown anywhere near that ability  At least Lukaku was coming off of two fantastic seasons at Inter and already shown he could do it in England. I don't think anybody at the time thought that fee was unwarranted  Maybe you could argue Lukaku is the biggest ""flop"" ever, while Antony is the worst overall signing, if that makes sense Worst Yet .. He scored 21 goals in all competitions for a mediocre Roma team last season. €30m isn't a big transfer fee. Somewhere Marina is still working for us... I am convinced He’s not a bad player if played in league and system that suits him. Surprised Napoli paid this much tbh Because it’s never really been about him being a bad player. That’s the frustrating thing, if his attitude wasn’t the way it is he could’ve done well here His style of play is very well suited to the Serie A thank god and don’t forget he’s not bad just a cunt He's still a good player, just on the wrong side of 30s. Conte is not leaving ADL much choice Cause he may be a jackass and a meme but Lukaku is still a top quality (though no longer elite) striker.  If he wasnt an asshole he could easily be worth double this The guy is unreal in Italy. A goal involvement in like 70% of his games. Pls no... Hell nah leave us outta this No they did, it’s why his return to Inter fell through. They had an agreement to buy him last summer too, and then Lukaku delayed signing back with us to wait for Juve so we said fuck that and moved on.  But nobody wanted to pay Juve 70m for Vlahovic so they didn’t end up getting him. Cagliari in 10 Lost every battle but won the war. First time for everything I suppose lol. I thanked God for seeing me through that day of days and  promised that I would find a nice peaceful town and spend the rest of my life in peace… Happy xmas With Lukaku, you never know. We may sign him again... This is really the on again off again type of girlfriend/boyfriend relationship Nah he won't. Tuchel in a team meeting while analysing the spurs match on seeing Conte told Lukaku, ""hey your daddy"". We were done after that interview and he was done after that. Felix didn't shit on the club in a rogue interview 2 months after we signed him so yeah... No. no thanks Somehow, Lukaku returned. i guess we shouldn't fix problems because there's always a bigger one He owes us after the 2017 window. I think you mean Mr. Adele Man is clearly putting in the work to make sure that changes lol What's with portugal and soccer agents? Epic Sports is based out of portugal also. Jorge Mendes is Portuguese. So by what you're saying 2 of the biggest agents in the soccer world are in portugal? I don't want to know... West brom fans might be upset about being called Birmingham. Tbf Newcastle were dogshit from 2014-2022 Probably an ad for other players/clubs trying to get their moves Hey kepa could leave on loan I'd be okay with kepa staying and playing if he was willing, though Sterling is no where near the torment Kepa and Lukaku have cause this is... false Broja is a moot point since he’d likely count for  the next summer window if Ipswich survives. Omari Hutchinson 18mill  Ian maatsen 37.5mill Lewis hall 28mill   Are you remembering these 3 Sales He's reportedly on a bit more than half those wages since last summer, he agreed to permanently reduce them from 16.9m to 9.9m a year while the club was negotiating the Roma loan. And We always does Just saw someone watching someone jump for joy in a target As a roma fan, sure, but he's also slow, got the first touch of an elephant and brainfarts alot. 30m rising to 45 with potential bonuses and 6.5 per year for a 31 yo is ludicrous for serie a. Maybe in the Premier league it can be glossed over but Napoli got fleeced hard imo. Maybe but he did ask for him in his other teams. I hope bloody NOT!! No really, we need more a wide forward Chelsea and Tuchel didn't help the situation either. They let emotions get the best of them. Leave it to Chelsea fans to be more knowledgeable about accounting rather than football It was rumoured at the time that Pogba’s agents fee, which came out of the total transfer fee was in excess of €35m.  I’m not sure to what extent that was accurate. But his clients appreciated him. > from even  > two of the biggest transfers in history >even on 5% commission its still more than enough, most people never make that much money in their entire lives  You severely underestimate future inflation my friend Wasn't it a 4-0 win too? Possibly goes down in history as the worst outcome of a 4-0 win Kante We signed Lukaku the summer after we won the Champions League. That's the only way Chelsea know how to win the Champions League. They had one of the best teams I've ever seen and managers like Ancelotti and Mourinho only for Di Matteo to win it with an aging team nowhere near quality of the 05 or 09 squads. Morata still outscored Lukaku for Chelsea lol Palmer said he didn't wanna leave Man City as well. The difference is he shows up on the pitch - lukaku played like a traffic cone almost every match. he would not even wanna get involved in the play In your context, that makes sense. Lukaku wasn't a terrible buy on the surface.   Let's say we discount his behaviour, too...  The absolute showstopper in the deal was that you had the UCL winners on one side, and a guy who played a distinct style on the other, and I'm sure a fair few pointed out that there might be a mismatch. Certainly Petr & Marina, and probably Tuchel, should have seen that it didn't look like a good fit.  But I don't think anyone saw just how obstinate RL was going to be about even trying a tiny bit to adjust his play for the reigning champs.  Either way, two great examples of deals gone very wrong! Antony is also a wife beater Antony is just your next Bebe.   Lukaku is our only Judas. Hazard is worse than Anthony I see your Anthony and as an arsenal fan I raise you one Pepe The level of disrespect Lukaku gets is unreal given his goal scoring record. Because even though hes old he still performed better than one season wonder Osihmen last year. He’s 31 and declining, potentially paying 45M is insane People really try hard to spin it lol.  - he scored 13 goals in the league if we're comparing full seasons of any other player. 13 goals while being the go-to ""9"" almost the whole season  - to put it in real scale: Lukaku was 10th among regular Serie A forwards in terms of how often he scores, while being 5th highest paid  - Roma being ""mediocre"" somehow phrased as some positive achievement of a player that played in... Roma. He was one of the players who played the most and had the most impact on how good Roma was. But it is his achievement that Roma was mediocre! Wow, who wouldn't be dying to sign a player that can make a high-budget team play mediocre level! Makes sense.  - 30 million euro is one of the highest transfer fees ever for a player who is 31 or older. In Serie A, we had Batistuta, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bonucci.   One line of text and so much manipulation, tbh impressive lol. This made me wonder what happened to  Tammy Abraham. I assume he was heavily injured last season. Its 21 goals in 47 games but only 13 in 32 in the league.  5 of those 8 remaining goals were scored against teams far below roma’s level ??? Wtf it was never a question about ability or play-style. he just burned bridges immediately and was outcast. He has done well for many different clubs in different leagues (and national team) I mean every league he's played in has suited him because he's scored goals in all of them, it's literally just Chelsea lol. Did fine in the PL as well. He's just got limitations and doesn't have the technique to be as great as he thinks he is. Still does a job for most places. Ex Chelsea players have worked out well for you so far you will take 35 year old Lukaku and you will like it. He's going to kiss your badge in 2 years time. Mark my word. Yea but I meant that Juve didn't follow through after it got public -Be Lukauku, publicly and repeatedly stating your love for and desire to play at a certain club  -Reach a Champions League final with them  -Enter negotiations to join their archrivals  ... Won the war? No they didn't. They paid €113m for him, played one season at incredibly high wages, loan 2x for a total €13.8m, and he still has 2 years on his contract... Now being sold for €30m. This was the last place I expected to see an obscure Band of Brothers quote. An individual of culture you are. Which time? Tbf Felix hasn't been signed permanently for two months yet. There's still time Can you check what felix said about atleti when he was in loan on barcelona Nah lukaku is a pretty good player. Now you've signed actual mediocrity. Putting in the $$$ for non-Brits, Birmingham city limits includes the entire midlands. Truth but it's still funny Hope it’s an obligation attached but with this club they’ll pull a permanent transfer out their ass last second this. is. BOEHLY! Very very false We spend around 250m on transfers this window so far and generated about 160m in sales  Neto 60m  Felix 52m  KDH 35m  Jorgensen 24m  Kellyman 22m  Anselmino 15m  Veiga 14m  Wiley 10m  Guiu 6m  Total: 238  Maatsen 44m  Gallagher 42m  Hall 33m  Omari 23m  Moreira 2m  Broja 35m*  Lakaka 45m*  Total: 224m  All prices in euros. Big if true That aren't higher than purchases We’ll pay 45m in the best case scenario and all the add-ons are triggered. If we win the Scudetto and/or he scores 20+ I’ll give them the extra 15m myself lmao You are getting by *far* the better end of this arrangement mate. Sterling then Leave it to Chelsea fans to have enough braincells to type 2 words into Google. A big ask for most people in R/Soccer ik It was 100% true. Juventus released an official statement where they said after payments they were left with €65m. Does that amount go to the agent's company rather than straight into the agent's own pocket? If you even just take 45% from Neymar to PSG's transfer fee you'd get €90m the Pogba one happens like 2 or 3 times every year now lol  hardly one of the biggest transfers in history I remember the optimism of that night. Smashing juventus 4-0 in the champions league? Stuff of dreams. Who could have predicted the chaos that followed Yes. Absolutely destroyed Juve. But Reece and Chilly both got injured, and its just been a nightmare since. I mean for some reason nobody talked about PSG winning 4:0 against Barcelona in 2017 for very long 🤔 lol get cursed idiots Tbh we always knew how to do good signings after winning big. Remember summer after Conte won PL? Greek Tragedy levels of drama. It was the UEFA Super Copa and Mourinho took over, the match went to pens and he was the 5th(?) taker; whereas Drogba clinically finishes for the trophy, Lukaku missed and ceded it. Both against Munich Tbf when we won it the second time, I’d argue we genuinely were one of the best in Europe at the time. It just didn’t last very long before things fell apart. The Lukaku interview, government sanctions, injuries etc all began just a year after Tuchel joined. People might have written us off as underdogs because of our league position, but our record after Tuchel came in was very good. 2021 was by far the best we’ve been since we won the league with Conte. Whereas 2012 was probably the worst season we’d had until then in the Roman era, right up until we won the Fa Cup and Champions League. Worse, he'd throw up his arms every time someone dint pass him the ball Bernardo Silva has been trying to get out of City for 3 years now and still puts in elite seasons with an amazing work ethic He gets disrespect for his character, not his abilities. Just don’t rely on him in a big match and he’s a perfectly fine player. Problem is he talks like he’s one of the best ever. In what way is he declining? I assume the add ons are based on goals scored and/or European qualification. If his goals help get them back into the Champions League at the minimum, how is €45m 'insane'? Whilst an overpay, it's most definitely not insane. It's not even guaranteed money and is most likely dependent on CL qualification The potential 15M is likely tied to his or the Teams performance, so that's not really a concern.    30 million for a striker who's done well in the league is definitely worth it to Napoli, it's not that much even if he only gives one more good year.  I'm sure they only pay the extra 15 if he reaches outlandish benchmarks that would mean they got their money's worth regardless. > Roma being ""mediocre"" somehow phrased as some positive achievement of a player that played in... Roma lol. He was one of the players who played the most and had the most impact on how good Roma was. But it is his achievement that Roma was mediocre!  Honestly, this is complete nonsense. The argument of a child.  > 30 million euro is one of the highest transfer fees ever for a player who is 31 or older.  If you say so, it's certainly not close to being the highest, and it doesn't mean it's a lot of money for a prolific goalscorer.  > In Serie A, we had Batistuta, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bonucci. Some shoes to fill.  'Some shoes to fill' doesn't even make sense in this context, but Batistuta had one good season at Roma and Bonucci was not good in his second spell at Juventus, so I have no idea why you would bring them up. He did more than fine, he has over a 100 goals in the prem and had a 20 plus goal season with Everton and close to that with West brom when he was a young player. All these strange Chelsea fans gas lighting people in to thinking he's been exposed by the league he scored most of his goals in lol when their club is the only place he's struggled to score goals. It would be the strangest timeline for that to happen... imagine him with all the other CFC alumni... No I’m pretty sure Juve had every intention of buying him still, but the deal hinged on somebody buying Vlahovic. And nobody ended up buying Vlahovic. You forgot to add ""gets robbed from starting the final even though he was the striker in better form"" Lost every battle and lost the war but the war is finally over is more apt [deleted] We break even on FFP terms and get his wages and bad attitude off the books, it’s a peace treaty but one in our favour. Either, and that further speaks to the point that Lukaku's mouth is his own worst enemy. Fucker makes you question loyalty even in a team of mercenaries we currently employ. Yeah but Atleti deserves it No, I'm saying this is false information, we are not in net profit, our expenditure is still much higher. Mason Mount goes on the books for this season. Also we have a 20% sell on clause for Guehi… How did I completely forget you signed KDH lol I'm confused, the totals in your list are different from the top Who tf even are Veiga Kellyman Anselmino and Wiley [deleted] [deleted] Oshimen for 120m and 350k per week is a better arrangement than 45m and about 200k per week for Lukaku? Uhm, I really don't think it is, like at ALL.  Thankfully, it looks like it's not happening, tho 😁 Yea. that is the last game i remember under tuchel where i would say we were world class. We showed up against RM and Liverpool later on as well, but that match against Juve made me believe we would be one of the top clubs in Europe I was at that game. Ironically I wasn’t meant to go but my brother had COVID and gave me his ticket. I’ve never enjoyed a night of football quite like that. When CHO scored in that game I felt on top of the world I've seen Reece James tearing down Juventus defence like he was Cafu and Neymar combined. It was bound to happen that his hamstrings weren't able to sustain that intensity. Summer after Mourinho won the PL in 14/15 was legendary, too Yeah, I'm unironically happy to have the Bruhkaku in Serie A, he belongs in Italy and he can do good things at Napoli  Him being a meme machine is just the cherry on top I mean, it’s not going to be all that long until he has another falling out. It’s like clockwork with him. Everybody knew he was going to be a bigtime superstar and it was something he confirmed was waiting to happen in his early career seasons. But things didnt pan out that way and it's actually good he never lost confidence seriously vs having to see him continue to be stuck up and uncompromising, but for the transfer fees to continually be close to 100m from Everton to Man U, from Man U  to Inter, and from Inter to Chelsea, and for him to seldom be on that hype realization, it's frustrating to see his career pan out so boringly. No but his character leads to people thinking he’s not a good footballer when he pretty objectively is. Sort of a guilty of association type thing. He’s close to 300 career goals which he will likely reach this season provided he doesn’t get injured. 300 career or more goals gets you talked about as one of the greatest attackers of all time and a club legend for somebody. Lukaku will never considered an all time great and he will never be a club legend for anyone. All because he is the way he is. Cosplaying as an American athlete. That’s unfortunate. The comment they're replying to ""how is he still worth so much money? 😭"" says otherwise He gets disrespected for his ability to suck at the biggest moments when all eyes are on the game. He gets a lot of shit for his footballing as well. The internet has basically made him a meme footballer and made him up to be shit. They all forget that when he's balling, he's beyond world class. Because people think Reddit memes and opinions are real life, vs what actually happens on the pitch. He was on 100 minutes per goals/assist 2 seasons ago at inter milan to 160 minutes with roma. I think that qualifies as declining He’s not the player he used to be, and he’s physic has been criticised. I’m an Inter fan, I was glad we didn’t buy him last season, he’s not the same he was in terms os agility. Napoli will pay high wages and will never get the money back in a resale. They could probably find a younger/better option, but Conte would cry forever. Exactly. Have people in this sub seen the current state of the striker market? I've never understood the hate he got purely as a player with us when he didn't really fit Tuchel's system, but still scored a fair amount of goals when he played.  His problem was the attitude. They'd have a little bit of everything - Lukaku #9, Pulisic on the wing, RLC in midfield, Tomori in defense, and Giroud in goal Ah I thought it just fell in the water because of Juve fans backlash when it got public Real Romania World War 2 Vibes. Hope it’s not about league position either You don't break even. Amortized of 5 years, you lost money on years 2 & 3, and 30m over the last 2 is a loss as well. If he hits all the add ons, you're close to breaking even for the last 2 seasons (but still not there), but still a loss on years 2 & 3 and you absolutely didn't get 20m value out of him in the 1 season he played for you all, let alone the wages you paid him over the course of the contract. I'm such a forgiving person... but when we found out that he'd been negotiating with (who was it, Inter?) after his public apology and fake contrition - wow, that was it for me for good. Yeah i was making a *[300](https://youtu.be/G7AinOjDiNQ)* joke. we're only £1 million in the red (Mount's sale goes in this year's books) Why does Mount go on the books this year and not last? Even then, we're still in net loss. Kevin De Huyne? huh? Veiga came on against City so he’s a left footed LCB/LB. And Kellyman was part of a PSR swap deal with I wanna say Villa? Fuck knows on the other two. IF  The guy above claims we already are net positive which is not true. Because Greenwood is a woman beater and walking PR nightmare for any big club (I know OM is a big club but not with as much international scrutiny). Same. My personal favourite from that season was the 2-2 vs Liverpool in the league. Performance and feeling after wasn’t the same as the Juve game obviously, but the whole stadium just went absolutely nuts when Pulisic scored. And it was genuinely one of the more end to end, entertaining games of pure football I’ve seen. The sad thing is people are eventually going to forget how much of a beast Reece James is/was.  Well the sad thing is him not being able to play and reach his potential but yeah, that too. Papy Djilobodji. Legend, Leader, Loanee. His issues are that every club he goes to suddenly becomes his boyhood team (hence falling out with Chelsea after his Inter stint), and having a really fragile ego ( posting sensitive running data while at united) Part of it is him being unlucky as well. His Man Utd move coincided with them being on a massive downturn. United used to be a club where arguably average players would look like stars, but they’d become a club where superstars could look like flops. Lukaku joined them during the latter period. He then eventually went back to Chelsea at a time where external circumstances just through the club into turmoil.   He should’ve stayed with Inter. He was on the path to doing great things with them. Yeah, the career everyone expected from Lukaku when he was 16, it just didn't happen. It's not trying to be mean like they say lol, it's just sane sober comparison. If you see a guy THIS talented when he's a teenager, you just think, this guy can score more than 18 goals in his career in Champions League. It's much fewer than for example Morata, Dżeko, or the haha-loser Harry Kane. For example Gabriel Jesus has way more already and he's not had some gigantic world-best career.  When people here say: oh, he scored so many goals, they include he scored them in Everton, West Brom, they include Europa League... of course that's nice, he's had a great career, but for a player commented here as the best in the world, as worth THIS transfer at this age... Europa League and mid-table was not really what we thought is what he can achieve. But anytime he flirted with the very top level, it worked out worse than at this 2nd tier level.  It seemed like in Inter he truly reached his place, it still wasn't the very best team in the world at that time, but it was a strong team and he was ruling the league (and Europa League). 2020, 2021 - top player in the world. The thing is, the next 3 years happened then, and he just never returned to that form, which was actually as good as everyone here keeps saying he still is. That is weird to me, as 3 years is quite some time in football.   It's pretty surprising as many other players who play similarly to him are NOT commented on that way at all lol. He scored 13 goals in the Serie A season and top comments are ""you cannot deny how many goals he scores, you may dislike him personally but the number of his goals will always crush your nuts!!!"". Nobody says that about, dunno, retiring Giroud or ""Icelandic Greenwood"" Gudmunthsson, who scored more goals last season. Because 13 was just objectively never before commented on here as a gigantic amount of goals for a goal-scoring ""9"".   And now... people are commenting ""even if he has one good season, 40 million is good money"". That's like saying a young player with 10 years ahead of him is worth investing 400 million euro. That player would be really good, a Champions League level player, surely? He is kind of a club legend for Anderlecht tbf >> beyond world class  Are you sure? [deleted] > He’s not the player he used to be, and he’s physic has been criticised.  No really, be more vague.  > will never get the money back in a resale  So what? Not every transfer is made in the hopes that the player will subsequently be sold for the same amount or more.   > They could probably find a younger/better option  Not for €30m they couldn't. We're literally selling an infinitely better and younger striker to bring him in ffs. That joke would be even funnier if Olli was still in Milan. [deleted] 100 million over 5 years, he has been here for 3, he  has 40 million of amortization left. The add-ons likely will be achieved, or we wouldn’t have sold to Napoli. We are selling for potentially €45 million, so we will break even. Even if we don’t, we have not paid his wages the past 2 seasons, and we have received loan fees. So we are breaking even for sure. I mean, to be honest, I have no idea. I did hear that on several podcasts though by 1M That guy is actually from the future actually. Soooo that's you sorted. Egg meet face. I still blindly believe in him. Had the surgery and gonna be back in a couple games. This time he’s staying fit… please🙏 So, you could say, “falling out” with the club. I think Everton also speak highly of him. Also Everton. Legend maybe not, but definitely highly regarded He can be beyond world class in 2 ways.   As a godlike goalscoring machine.   Or.... Lakaka the 10v12 Meme striker god  You just have to flip a coin Well that might have been an exaggeration. But when he finds his rhythm he's one world class. His stats for Belgium speaks for themselves. 350 something goals in his career as well. It's just that he jumps clubs as often as zlatan. Its one thing if we’re comparing between playing for title contenders and relegation candidates but that inter team finished only 9 points more than that Roma team. A team that finished 3rd to a team that finished 6th. Its not that big a difference Not only 36y Dzeko was much better than 30y Lukaku, he also would sacrifice himself more for the team. But yeah, pay 30M for the Belgium that will probably wanna leave as soon as Conte quits Well that’s a Conte / Osimhen problem lol Probably cause it’s low hanging fruit tbh, definitely not the most witty of comments.   Glad you appreciated it though >40 million of amortization left  Pounds - or €47.15m  >We are selling for potentially €45 million, so we will break even. Even if we don’t, we have not paid his wages the past 2 seasons  Which is £38m, which is less than the 40m left.  >and we have received loan fees  Totaling €13.8m or £11.7m over 2 seasons, which doesn't even cover 1 season (£20m) of his contract amortized over 5 years, let alone 2 seasons.  There is absolutely no way you're breaking even.   So take £100m - 38m (or 25.45m if he doesn't hit the add ons) - 11.7m = 50.3m (or £62.85m without add ons) - which is essentially his cost for the 1 season he played for you all.  Also  >or we wouldn’t have sold to Napoli.   You sold to Napoli b/c they were the only team willing to go for him. Its nonsense. Don't believe everything you hear.   Mason Mount's transfer happened after June 30th 2023, so it will be counted in the books for the accounts from July 1st 2023 till June 30th 2024.  The books have nothing to do with the actual transfer window (which ends on 1st September every year). No matter which way you look at it, Mount's transfer was in the previous summer transfer window (2023) and in the previous accounting year (which ended June 30th 2024). with assumption Lukaku fulfills all bonuses and Broja is accounted for this season (he won't) My phone says you replied to their comment 3 minutes before they wrote it, spooky. Hope so too mate. The setback at the end of pre-season killed me, as I'm sure it did Reece. I hope it's a really really minor thing and he'll be back and stay fit. he was adding to your point, not disagreeing with you His UCL final with inter has to be one of the worst individual performances I have ever seen in a long time, I think the last one I called this way was gomez against napoli [deleted] What's your argument here, that they should have signed Dzeko instead? Still, it's an objective downgrade, very difficult to feel good about the situation seeing one of my favourite players ever leave and be replaced by 31 year old Lukaku. It doesn’t matter if we don’t make actual profit on him, the amortization rules and the way accounting works mean we are breaking even in terms of book value What if they did a loan for a year with mandatory purchase after June 30th 2024?   All case and purposes from the outside it looked like a straight buy for instance.  Or would we know if that was the case with a year loan then a buy? With the sale of the hotel and everything it wouldn't surprise me they would do something like this because we were probably good for FFP with those sales. I root for Chelsea to succeed. How about you? Yeah I was so annoyed when I saw that. I do just think it’s standard stuff post surgery though, rather than an actual setback. He was back on the grass almost straight away.  I know the popular narrative is to protect him, but I do want to see him overlapping for Palmer. Would be a shame if he comes back and stays fit but basically just plays like a CB like Walker. He’s capable of so much more if his body can handle it. Yep He's just not made for the big games. Also scoring the own goal to lose the final against Sevilla in EL lol Lautaro Martinez was the most shocking. At least when Lukaku came on, he made an impact. How about Dzeko UCL final with Inter? Complete ghost. I’m comparing 22-23 inter to 23-24 roma…… Mate, my point is simple, I think that for a club it’s bad deal do buy Lukaku in 2024. But we both know this would’ve happened as soon as they appointed Conte. He wants to leave and play UCL 🤷🏻‍♂️  ADL fucked up by not selling him after scudetto season and regearing. You offered him an insane contract and now it’ll severely handicap how much you can sell him for No, you don't, since the 38m is still less than the book value of 40m.  And you already lost money in the previous seasons, in terms of book value so in order to ""break even"" (in total) you would have to make up for that with his sale, which you're not even covering the rest of the remaining book value.   I'm not arguing that you're making a profit, I'm arguing that you're not ""breaking even"" b/c you're absolutely not - not in terms of his remaining contract or his total contract. These things are usually very widely reported. As with Hall, we did Newcastle a favour by letting them purchase him this season because they wouldn't have been compliant if they had to pay up last season He can and still point out we aren’t profitable this season hahaha Me too, but I don't know how is that relevant to the point I'm making here.  Do you want to say that because I want the club to succeed I should lie about our transfer spend? [deleted] Again, he's coming off a season where he scored 21 goals for a mid team. €30m is not a high transfer fee for a 31 year old who just scored that many goals and to play for a manager who trusts him.   Your 'point' is all over the place, you keep trying a new angle to make it sound like a bad deal, and your last effort was complete gibberish. Touch grass He can have that opinion, but it’s pessimistic and wrong lol You definitely don't root for Chelsea. Your posts make you look like an Arsenal fan. They went from 6th place to 6th place….. It’s pessimistic on our transfer dealings but we literally haven’t made a profit this year, it isn’t wrong. [deleted] Except the accounting above is wrong.   Does not factor in Mount money, does not factor in undisclosed but not insignificant academy sales of Webster, Rankine, Cumming + Bashir just left on a loan + 15m obligation that books this season. We’re easily 5 to 15 M in the green right now with achievable targets to improve. 👇🏻  We have a 20% sell on on Guehi which looks pretty likely to come good and might then open up a landing spot for Trev (will be sad to see him leave)…   Plus net spend is a banter metric.  With amortization and our long contracts, we will doubtless book an accounting profit this year on player trading. What even is your point here? Yes we all know that Roma went through a bit of a bad time with Mourinho but by the end of the season, they still finished 6th again thanks to de rossi. You can’t just look at the mourinho stint and ignore everything else.  Clearly they didn’t do too badly overall, the team were capable of winning enough games, scoring goals and picking up points. In fact, they scored 15 more goals than they did the previous season.  That’s why it makes no sense to excuse lukaku’s declining performance by saying the team was dysfunctional when they objectively were not and the attack in particular were perfectly functioning and capable of performing. Hell if you wanted to you can use this as evidence that Lukaku was good for them."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Shudders at Keita there Obviously hindsight plays a factor but I don’t think we’ll ever do a better transfer than Salah for €42 Million again. Klopp’s biggest signings were essentially his first signings in each position after the Rodgers era. We nailed them all pretty much. He added Mane and Salah to work with Firmino. Wijnaldum, Matip, Robertson were crucial signings and then we were able to go big with Van Dijk, Alisson and Fabinho. I still think Oxlade-Chamberlain would have been great for us it wasn’t for the injuries Think the biggest miss here was Keita.  Nunez has shown glimpses of the value but we just need that consistency and scoring the chances that you’d expect from a 30m striker.  Szobo looked brilliant before his injury, so expect him to continue on that trajectory this season now he’s had a proper rest.  Gakpo hopefully gets that LW as his main position this year and we will see the value there too.  The rest speak for themselves really, overall good business, especially when you look at other clubs spending in that period It's a shame these have been so successful, as the headline ""Klopp's Flops"" is sitting right there. 1. Overpaid  2. World record fee but worth it  3. I think fair price but we’ll see  4. Another world record fee but also worth it  5. Massive flop  6. Good value for money  7. Good value for money  8. Good value for money  9. Unbelievable value for money  10. Decent value for money This year is make or break for Darwin if we go by his 2 years so far he hasn't been worth the money   Szoboszlai was looking like a bargain when the season started but he got injured and never got to the level he was at the start of the season but jury's out for him rn   Keita we got scammed hard   Rest has been alright Pretty good track record that. Every signing has been a success apart from Keïta (that too because of injuries more than anything else) and maybe Núñez Hey look! We're in a statistic! VVD, Salah and Alisson are absolutely top transfers. Salah is a textbook example for a bargain. A list of transfer fees? Gotta be the top news of the day on r/soccer. Mostly really good signings. Smart money right there. He may have slightly overpaid for Nunez VVD, Alison, Fabinho, Salah- Greats   Jota - good enough   Diaz - good   Darwin, Gakpo,Szoboszlai - underwhelming so far   Keita - Disaster Didn't realise Szob was that expensive. More hits than misses. What the fuck is going on in this thread? 42m for literally a top 10 goalscorer in the club's history is mental. This is like the average Chelsea window Salah an absolute steal He really went 9/10 here. Can't believe we paid for Nunez more than vvd Darwin was much less than that. He was 64 million pounds MAX, as none of the add-ons have been met I imagine.   Diaz was 45 million euros...  What's crazy is Chelsea/City/United have been spending 2/3rds of this amount in one window. This was over Klopp's entire 9 years at Liverpool. Only 1 bad signing (Keita) is pretty good to be honest.  I guess you could say Nunez is still up for debate given the price. Great era of lfc. His net spend is nowhere as high as cfc or utd, and his success was much greater. Mad that Keita is the only real miss amongst that list.  Nunez and Gakpo a bit early to tell but I think they’ll come good. Nunez being his most expensive signing is...an odd feeling tbh This is why football coaches are called managers, his business skills are on par with a top CEO Only flop on that list is Keita. Everyone else has made a name for themselves in a Liverpool shirt. Sometimes maybe good sometimes maybe shit Some hits, some misses, some grand slams. One of them is not like the others... :S Can we delete and forget we ever signed Keita? Rest were solid signings maybe bit too much for Darwin and Dominik but still decent. mostly hits but a few ? ones, for sure Ah Jurgen, he’ll always be legend but he paid at least 4 times what Darwin Nunez is worth lol   Still pretty good list, obviously Keita was a miss and the jury could still be out on Nunez Crazy how number ten here is more expensive than our record transfer Caicedo would have shattered this if he wasn’t loyal to Chelsea 9/10 are some great odds to be fair. Keita being the obvious miss. What a disaster of a career he's had, even after leaving. Only two misses there, not bad at all. Pretty impressive that most have been great signings Impressive. Very nice. Now let's see Pep's. Nunez really flopped didn’t he.. fee paid for him by the club went straight to the garbage bin.. They paid that much for Szoboszlai?? Other than Keita, all signings are pretty decent I love how they can't handle Szoboszlai's name lmao pretty good track record here compared to others Its going to get more expensive for liverpool from now on. They're past ""the sleeping giant phase"" now every player they buy will come at a premium, Liverpool paid Nunez at day 1 what Salah was paid after he won everything with liverpool. The only signing that wasn't worth it was Darwin. Well, at least up until now. Who knows, maybe he'll stop missing 99.9% of every big chance This really should show the year it happened too In today's economic situation VvD's fee would be £104m. World Cup winner (and protagonist) Alexis MacAllister is not even there.   Imagine if he had been called Alexinho. Do we still have to pretend he was a pauper doing it on a shoestring or are we allowed to be honest now he’s gone? Lies, Klopp never spent any money. He created these players. People will look at this and forgot that his net spend is so low when compared to Pep/Arteta It's time for Diaz and Nunez to show their worth. Think Klopp's system isn't the best fit for them cause they need to create chances on their own (Mane, Firmino were able to do that).  Hoping that by Slot's approach of solid midfield passing play can unlock easier chances for them to put the ball away. Man, I thought Naby Keita was going to be our N'golo or Claude Makelele, couldn't have been more wrong. Heart breaking. Just thought, then  Do you reckon we haven't signed anyone, because FSG don't trust Arne to spend money.  They just want to see what his coaching is like, this season. With current players [deleted] The director at the club I coach at was talking shit about Pep a couple weeks ago and saying Klopp is one of the best managers of all time because he didn't need billions of dollars to build his teams. I wish I could show him this graphic.  Obviously both are brilliant coaches but to say Klopp didn't benefit from the power that Liverpool had in the transfer market is crazy. Would we have been able to buy Virgil AND Alisson if not for the sale of Coutinho. I think not.     Potentially selling Salah we could have paid for Mbappé. Otherwise I feel like we buy the players we want and don’t end up overpaying…. except for Keita. To be fair though sometimes players have all the talent in the world but their bodies are just not up to it. This just can't be right. They said he operates on a peasant budget Plucky little Liverpool But Liverpool never spent a thing... Jota, VVD, salah by far the best signings Klopp made.. others were okay.. Two huge flops, jury is still out for 3 of them, 2 are ok (exactly worth their price) and 3 of them are massive hits. Not great, not terrible. What a mix,! world class aignings and disasters side by side. So.. success rate is about 50-50?  Surely van Dijk, Alisson, Fabinho and Salah are insanely good signing. Mans knows how to splash cash. This is like 50% overpriced dross and 50% some of the greatest signings of the PL era....and Gakpo who's been alright that bum being top makes me sick. God awful transfer. hopefully these are his last 12 months at the club. Sorry, how does Naby Keita's pricetag get lower and lower every time it's mentioned. I distinctly remember the fee was closer to £80m(pound not euro) when he transferred. I remember how excited I was for the whole season before he arrived. Could never have predicted how badly it turned out We paid nothing and that still feels like we got fleeced Was a jumpscare for me. We paid 60m and got memes.  Naaaabbbyyy laaaaaad. Worth it. 1 flop out of 10 ain’t bad at all Honestly looked like a steal at the time   Keita at Leipzig was one of the best players in the Bundesliga.   Crazy hoe Nkunku and he absolutely struggle in the PL I was just wondering what is a Keita 1/10 being flops ain’t bad I feel like that‘s the only poor transfer here though. Nunez as the most expensive is the biggest shudder. Continho for 10m being sold for like 150m was special too. Mane for £34m was pretty amazing too. Robertson for 8 million is not bad either. As a Roma fan I was furious he was sold for only 40 mil. The class was evident. I still remember when my Utd supporting brother makes fun of Liverpool to annoy me for buying Salah for that much + because the name Salah means ""wrong"" in my native language lmao Suarez was 22 mil and almost won us the league. Would’ve sold him for 90-100 mil too which would’ve been a world record at the time if he didn’t munch of Chiellini Even crazier when you remember he wasn't Liverpool's first choice. Hard to disagree, €42M is ridiculously cheap when you look at what Salah achieved.   Diaz for €50M is great value as well imo, I will forever be annoyed at our board for ignoring Rangnick’s advice to explore signing him. Thank you for reminding me. Doesn't happen any day to have a team struggling with FFP selling you their best player without bargain because they need the money before 30th of June You only got Salah that cheap because of the FFP issues Roma was having/was restricted to. Sold Salah for 42 million and a week later Neymar goes for insane money… Mane for 35 mil. He was the OG core of Liverpool. They were up for a quadruple with him being the Ballon Dor star going neck and neck with Benzema and once he left, Liverpool got 5th and last seasn, choked the title race with Salah playing badly.  IMO Mane was the key cog of that front 3. The Gegenpressing system crumbled once he left. News just in! How have you picked this out? Pretty much all of our Klopp era Edward signings were on point with the exception of Keita. His form in the 17/18 season was frightening before his injury. He made 100-point City look amateur But it wasn't like Ox's injuries came out of the blue. He was a pretty frequent visitor to the physio room when he played for us That absolute missile against City, not once but twice, was lovely The man knows how to build a squad. Keita was only a miss due to his injuries imo. If he got injured a semi-normal amount I don't think many of us would be batting an eyelid at him. >Nunez has shown glimpses of the value but we just need that consistency and scoring the chances that you’d expect from a 30m striker.  Sorry, what? 30m? I love Nunez the guy wears his heart on his sleeve. Most players mature after 25 as u need to create space for yourself in the box which Nunez cannot do it yet hence ppl say if u give him time he misses. He needs more experience.  But i think the coming season will be important for him. He has the physique, pace & power to shoot but lacks a little positional awareness & timing. That will develop with time.  I love him for the fact that he was about to mouth off Pep & Klopp had to stop him lol. I think it says a lot that all the players you needed to caveat where the recent big signings.   Personally, I think that played a role in Klopp stepping aside. I’m sure he was tired etc. But I can’t help but think if those big signings had shown  Salah, Mane, VVD, or Allison levels, he might have stayed. I think he saw he’d sunk huge fees and wages into great players but ones that weren’t collectively the level needed to consistently compete.  Obviously, I expect Liverpool fans to see it differently. Maybe you can remind me in 5 years when Slob is the next KdB, Nunez is beating Haaland to the golden boot, and people are lording Konate as the best CB in the world. Personally, I just don’t see a squad at the level of previous Liverpool. Meanwhile, they are on larger wages, collectively cost larger fees, and still have years left on their contracts. Again great players I just don’t think they’re good enough to retain the level Klopp had set. He saw that the road was likely downhill and thought it was time to pass the reigns Klopp's Tops!  Not to be confused with Klopp Tops, which is very different. Hopefully Cody's euros form carries on to make him a good/unbelievable value Basically agree with everything but would add that we bought Keita hoping he wasn't going to be injured all the time. Yes, he was a flop in hindsight but had the potential so I'd remove the ""massive"". If we go by the 2 years then yea, £85m definitely seems excessive, but not so sure I would go back in time and un-buy him. We've still usually looked and performed significantly better when he's on the field, and he definitely knows how to put in a shift. But yea, not the most expensive signing ever levels of performance at all. Nunez will be absolutely unstoppable when he finally realises that he needs to put the ball past the goalkeeper and not hit the woodwork. nunez misses a lot of chances but still has 50 goal involvements from 96 games As an Arsenal fan, if he throws even one more chair the signing will be worth it for me. Half of the signings are not good VVD although seemingly expensive was a bargain. He took us up that level to win everything. Probably but I remember that summer and after haaland went the options were not plentiful, I think I'd still want us to sign him if I could go back. Disagree that Szobozslai has been underwhelming. It's just a recency bias.   If he'd started last season how he ended it, and ended last season how he started it, people would be raving about him. Gakpo has been good considering he never plays his best position and has put up godd numbers despite being deployed In midfield at points Release clause I believe Nobody knows the nature of the adds ons. The fee you've given isn't the max and saying so is stupid. We've definitely paid some add ons I think appearance based there was a story about it I remember 64M pounds is 74M euros right now, I think it was close to 75M when the transfer was made.  https://www.slbenfica.pt/en-us/agora/noticias/2022/06/13/futebol-benfica-darwin-comunicado-cmvm-transferencia-liverpool  It's not so far fetched that they already met 10M out of the 25M add ons, especially since it was based on goals and appearances.  https://www.daveockop.com/latest-news/liverpool-set-to-pay-benfica-another-add-on-for-darwin-nunez-transfer/  Diaz was 45M euros plus 15M in possible add ons. This source also claims that 50M were already paid  https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/luis-diaz-add-ons-activated-29184775 His success was much greater than Chelsea? Do they not have the same number of premier league trophies during his time? And Liverpool won 1 more major trophy than Chelsea? Doesn't sound much greater to me. Surely, not Darwin Nunes yet... I see only 1 Already posted few months ago Thank you Coutinho 🙏 Silly to judge managers from net spent when mostly the club is responsible for it. Klopp wanted Brandt, but Liverpool had competent management that choose Salah instead. >Unpopular opinion    🤔 Not unpopular at all, you can argue a case for Van Dijk, Salah or Alisson. It was Salah imo. Salah instantly became world-class and making sure he scores every game. It’s usually between him and Salah, I think there’s fair arguments for both, but Salah shows what Klopp does to players with regards to elevating their game, makes you wonder what other players could have done under him.  People also tend to say Firmino but he actually came in under Rodger’s but he was a ‘transfer committee’ signing > Potentially selling Salah we could have paid for Mbappé.  Uh when, exactly? Plucky compared to City spending and breaking rules at the rate I go through Jaffa cakes? Yes absolutely. It just means more But City never broke the rules …. 👀 Lol the audacity as a City fan to talk about other teams‘ finances Alisson? 50-50? what year did you start watching? LOL ""Fans"" like this makes me sick. Please go support another club if you’re not gonna support the players.  Moron. Nah you just remember wrong It was never £80m?   Leipzig wanted £70m to sell him the summer of 2017-18.  His release clause was £48m but didn't kick in until 2018-19.   We agreed to pay his release clause in the summer of 2017-18 plus up to £5m in bonuses based on where Leipzig finished in the league, but not get to sign him until the summer of 2018-19.   Again, it was never anywhere near £80m. You are completely misremembering then in my head it was £48m when I heard about it back then.  You are so far off you must be getting him mixed up with someone else.  Edit: just went and checked and BBC reported it was a £48m release clause Just gotta shrug at that point because the injuries were unpredictable. Everyone wanted Keita at the time, Bayern and Barca were chasing him, he looked silky smooth at Leipzig, and it was considered to be a big coup to get him, the perfect midfielder for a Klopp team. Everyone figured he was the missing link to a team that would steamroll everyone. Wasn’t meant to be. I put a tenner on him being Premier League player of the season. Twice… Same here, he was voted best midfielder in the Bundesliga the season before he came to us and I thought this guy is gonna fuck the whole league.   Shame he was made out of cotton wool. I actually saw him play live the year before you signed him and it was fucking mental how good he was with the ball. Yeah I thought he was going to be awesome in the prem and was jealous when I heard Liverpool had signed him. Humans are unpredictable at the end of the day, anything can affect a player. He was everything you could've wanted from a CM at Leipzig. 60m was a lot back in the day, but it was fair money for the player he appeared to be.   Now he's with us and it makes me a lil sad that no one wants him here anymore and he's to stubborn and proud to excuse his dumb behavior in the last season... man... Keita is one of the rare ones where I didn't agree with the overall hype for him when we got him purely based on watching him play I couldn't see what made people think he was going to be **the** guy. But I could tell everyone else was sure he was brilliant so I just shrugged and hoped for the best.  I was pretty disappointed to be proven right (albeit injuries being a huge mitigating factor in that). I say this as one of his biggest supporters and i genuinely hope he proves me wrong but Nunez hasn’t been worth the price so far. I acknowledge there’s more to his game than just scoring he’s brilliant in all round play but the amount of chances he keeps missing consistently he should be scoring 20+ goals easily. Nuñez Nunez, Szoboszlai and Diaz have a lot to prove to live up to the respective costs and could prove to be flops. The fact that they still play for the club, and thus get the benefit of the doubt, is the thing that prevents them from getting outright labelled as flops now.  Nunez is a constant wait and see, but the crowd that think his flaws are going to magically disappear are deluded. It's unlikely that he will unlearn the fundamentals of his game on the training field, nor is that a space where you can double your IQ.  I have a lot of love for Szobo and this could be a big season for him under Slot, but he was poor for a lot of the season. At the end of the day a player is only as good as their contribution, not their potential.  In a similar vein, Diaz's market value having increased is a misnomer, as like Szobo he made an excellent contribution when he first arrived (and when he actually added to Liverpool's control of games) because of the very poor spell the team was going through. Since then it's become all too clear that he's ill-suited to Liverpool's possession based football and hasn't found ways to express himself as an attacker (i.e. leading to goals and assists). In a counter-attacking team he might shine, but his contribution is limited to working the ball upfield and high-risk low-reward dribbles.  So I look at this list as a mixed bag. Some extremely, extremely good signings in there, and some that don't look great - but that's the same as any club. Saying it's just Keita is silly though. Number 1's also a flop. More like one flop out of 5, really. Nunez, Dias, Jota, Szoboslai, and Gakpo haven't really landed one way or the other yet. Nkunku has started 2 games, I don’t think it’s fair to say he’s struggled Nkunku was always injured, when he played he did well but he barely played that's the problem. Cmon now, no need to insult Nkunku like that Nkunku has not struggled in terms of performance, he’s been injured the whole time I remember being so excited and watching his games once the deal had been announced, remember Gerrard giving him the #8 too and it just felt like he was truly the chosen one and the right choice to take the shirt on following Gerrard.  Don’t even know where it all went wrong, obviously injuries played a part but I just feel there’s more there that we didn’t see Nkunku only played like 10 matches last season due to injury... Nkunku has been injured the entire time lol let him play a full season first before we judge him Yes thanks for the seasonos Continho. The Cortinho sale was the most important business that Liverpool did under Klopp. Enabled them to buy the players needed to compete toe for toe with City Coutinho and Torres are prime examples of how not to listen to fan sentiments when keeping players. Its funny both those sales absolutely fleeced the buying clubs, yet fans complain and whine just for sentiment reasns.  IMO, Salah being sold to Saudi for 200 mil + cutting 400k per week would have been the next one with how horrible he played last seasn during the title push, but they missed out on that.   Could easily get 2-3 world class players as replacement + some spare change for that amount. Salah, Mane and Firmino were all considered massive overpays at the time lol.  I remember a ""Bundesliga expert"" writing Firmino for 28 million was an indictment of how careless prem teams are with money as he apparently wasn't worth anything near that.    Mane came in as pretty much our joint highest fee for a player ever and people tore us to shreds about it being ""another Southampton player we're massively overpaying for"".    Salah similar. He actually broke our transfer record and despite putting up multiple 20+ g/a seasons in Italy was nothing but a ""premier league reject"".    I will say this was all before Neymar to PSG which massacred the market overnight. 35 million being our record transfer for a player as recently as 8 years ago (fuck me where has the time gone), whereas now 35 million barely gets you a teenager with one professional season. 8m for a relegated left back. Then proceeds to get the most assists for a full back. 0.5 million  tbf, Neymar for 222m happened two weeks later. That’s what fucked up player valuations for years to come Yeah you could tell even when he was at Fiorentina he was something special. He was smoking every Serie A right back. You got absolutely robbed Malay? In Hindi it means your wife's brother 2011 wasn't *that* long before 2017 (scientists estimate between 2–13 years) but I remember 22m having a lot more spending power when the Suarez transfer was made, that was no loose change at the time.  He obviously ended up being worth quintuple that but I still think Salah's a better transfer both financially and for longevity's/impact's sake.  One almost single-handedly won us the league, one won the league and everything else while being talismanic for the better part of a decade.  Can't really blame Suarez for the bite either, Chiellini sounds like a delicious pasta dish he was probably just confused I mean, it was questionable at the time and risky. Turned out one of the best deals ever for ~~you~~ Liverpool. Pretty sure he was Liverpool’s first choice, but not Klopp’s. Might misremember though Think he had Brant over him. Tbh Gakpo is a better buy than Diaz The admin side of ManU has been madly and badly run for years there is no surprise good advice was ignored. They were all vital. Firmino and Mane faded first, though. Both just didn't have the legs to be who they were.  Salah has been able to maintain a world-class level, but by changing his game. Much more creator these days – though he still scores plenty. I'm keen to see how he does with an actual offseason and no traditional AFCON injury. Lmao no way are u trying to argue Mane over Salah 😂😂😂😂 that's just fraudulent in so many ways I have a gigantic brain you see. Keita on paper was also a good signing but injuries are always going to happen and he was made of glass. That's why they had 100 points and were champions right Not entirely true for his tenure with us tho. He suffered a nasty ACL that came from nowhere in the CL semifinal. From there it was very difficult indeed for him to keep fit. But I still remember that challenge from time to time and it wasn't pretty. I think he was very unlucky there. Yeah but they weren't all real injuries. He notoriously refused to play once because the air conditioning on an airplane gave him a stiff neck.  At a certain point, it's just an attitude problem. Ehhh, I think his performances when fit also didn't fit the price tag. He had some good performances but also some outright horrendous ones. Nunez is a *really* bad finisher. He is saying that forwards who get sold for 30m would be finishing chances that Nunez is missing. Not that Nunez was bought for 30m. Respect to you for saying nice things about a rival player!  I agree, I think obviously he's a striker and a professional, he knows how offsides and spaces work, if he can get a grasp of his confidence and mentality I think he wouldn't make so many mind numbing mistakes, we see keepers do it all the time, it's a night and day difference in their heads when it's less foggy.  I forgot about that incident with Guardiola, loved it! Especially when you know Nunez didn't speak much English at all at the time. well maybe he is a bottom A Klopp Top is like a tank top that is so short it shows the belly button, right? I really can’t see him being Salah’s level so unbelievable value seems to be out the window. Isn’t that the case with all flops? You sign them because you think they have the potential to be good, but they don’t live up to it - you can only know that they’re a flop in hindsight.  Keita is unquestionably a massive flop considering the price you paid. I would remove massive if I thought he was good when he was fit but even without the injuries, I still think he’d be a flop . I'd remove the word massive just because he actually had a season and a half where he played really, really well in and out of being injured.. Like when he played you can see *why* we spent that money.     Still a disappointing transfer nontheless. >not so sure I would go back in time and un-buy him.  It's the second thing I'd do after killing baby Hitler The only reason I wouldn't go back and un buy him is because the market is so dreadful, hojlund cost almost as much, Alvarez is going for the same price, it's a horrible time to buy a striker and he's at least close to being that star the price reflects Hasn’t changed much then. Next season will definitely be the season, and if not it’ll definitely be the season after that and if not then… The guy is always close though, if he could improve his accuracy and composure by 5%, he'd easily get 10 more goals.  He just lashes it when he should place shots or tries to place it and it's a little too wide and oings off the post.   I think he's also easier to read for a keeper, seems like a lot of keepers can pull off great saves against him because they know what he's going to try. It's not like Salah where he could feint at the last second or cut onto his right. He's not been good enough for a 85m striker though Plus from what I've heard he hits the woodwork pretty often doesn't he? I know it's a meme at this point, but this is mostly bad luck imo. I think he will score even more goals next season. Yeah. All three are bargains in the whole context. But Salah is hands down a proper one. We bought Isak in the same summer for £63m and he’s unreal, still surprised we got him however he had a poor season at Sociedad prior to joining us and we took the chance. Has he done the job he's signed for ? Not yet right ? So hence underwhelming. He hasn't taken over and started dominating that midfield.   Only macalister has. If u signed a mid for 70 million in a thin midfield u would expect him to stand out more. Hence i said underwhelming for him and good enough for jota, cos jota also plays out of position sometimes..I am not saying it's all on gakpo. But for Liverpool as a club considering the talent he has, about and money paid for it's been underwhelming. Nunez add-ons relate to goal and performance metrics, with a few appearance based things. So unless there is a specific one about the league cup, I doubt many have been met lmao. It's 64 million with a current potential 2/3 million. Nowhere near the 85 million pounds everyone quotes o.o Klopps Liverpool finished ab chelsea all but 1 yr, and cfc have finished bottom half the table, been out of Europe. Don’t get your panties in a wad Yes you are right not yet. If he becomes more prolific in front of goal and bags his chances. He could become a  top player. He already has pace, power aggression and good movement. Aye poor old Liverpool, how can they ever match the spending of other clubs Over 9 years 😂 Rules younger than Lamine Yamal brought about by a guy like Roman Abramovich to prevent other teams from doing what he did? Yeah fuck them rules lmao.   Citeh are however awful by virtue of breaking the transfer market with blood money same as Chelski The irony is lost on you then? Oh shoot I didn’t see him on the list, but now that I seen the list again so yhh you can add Alison aswel.. grow a spine pal. he's a mediocre player and has cost us time and time again. funnily enough, it's people like me upholding the standards at this club. I won't blindly support players that let us down over and over again. I don't know how anyone can.   I'm not going to ever personally send hate to the guy, but we need to recognise he's not good enough and never will be. Hmm, maybe. Who the hell am I thinking of then? I know they were a midfield flop whoever it was. I'm sure attitude played a role in it too. He's been a bellend at Bremen and I'm guessing that isn't new behaviour When we signed him he looked like the perfect midfielder, he passed the eye test and was statistically outstanding across the board. He was top class for interceptions, tackles, progressive passes and carries, goals and assists. We thought he was Iniesta and Kante combined. He wasn't a complete bust but I honestly don't think I've ever been more disappointed by a signing. He played a key part in the almost-quad season and for a brief, glorious time actually was the missing link playing alongside Thiago. His time with us was a letdown in the end but he won everything at at Liverpool and really really wasn't as bad as people make out.   Honestly, considering the passion I see a lot of fans defend Adrian, Nunez, Moreno etc the hatred Keita gets is excessive and a bit weird. Maybe he should have had a bubbly social media personality. So it was all your fault I agree he hasn’t been worth the price yet, but he’s hardly been a flop. I agree, and you could put Szoboszlai in the same category. Neither ‘flops’ in my opinion but expectations were definitely higher when they joined.   I’m sure we’ll see much more this season now they’ve both settled, hopefully The Nunez problem:  As a Center Forward: not sharp enough  As a Winger: not skilled enough  As a player to sell: not cheap enough Darwin’s ruined so many bets for me, if only there was an option for “over 10 shots with 0 on target” what about that Cavani guy? He wasn't clinical but he was still good nah, too early, if his finishing doesn't click in the next two seasons maybe but he just turned 25 so as a striker he still has some time to grow Acting like a player can only be a success or a flop is dumb.  Alex Oxlade chamberlain for example wasn't a massive success and had injury issues but he still contributed quite a lot and was a good transfer Diaz and Jota are definitely successful transfers at this point. Jota has been incredible. 2 seasons in which he contributed immensely, but Liverpool barely couldn't win the PL.   Gakpo has been misused, looked to be himself at the end of last season when he was played LW.  Diaz hasn't been amazing compared to the likes of Mane, but oh well.   Szoboszlai needs one more season to be judged properly. He's amazing for Hungary God why is everyone on the internet so hyperbolic? I guess you're either a smashing success or a flop with no middle ground. All of the players you've mentioned are leaning towards good or a mixed bag at worse I'd rather have him struggle than not play at all.. He's at Chelsea. He's struggling Same with Keita to a degree. The injuries ruined his hip mobility and things like that. Still gave us good stretches eg second half of the 21/22 season Still weird to see so many great Bundesliga players struggle elsewhere   Keita, Nkunku, Dembele, Sahin, Havertz,... I think multiple injuries led to a mental block and then he never recovered from that and the moneyos Hope his back is ok We got Alisson so… Coutinho was one hell of a player for us. Our very own Messi... But we didn't have a defense or a goalkeeper that can keep us competitive. Yes but there is no title push without how he performed before AFCON How horrible he played last season? You mean the season when he was our top goal scorer and top goal contributor? We were only in the title race because of Salah. Massively disagree here. Salah's season and contribution is massively underrated due to the formation change up with him playing off the boundary rather than his tranditional inverted winger position. Despite that, he still finished 4th in G+A.  The offer also came a bit later in the window IIRC, when replacements would have been more expensive. That is even more true when you consider the premium clubs would demand knowing Liverpool had both the cash and the need.  That's to say nothing about removing such a crucial cog in the same window they rebuilt the entire starting midfield and instituted a largely new system. Firmino has a particularly funny backstory as Brendan Rodgers was having none of him, but he reached an agreement with the transfer committee (Michael Edwards and co): He would let them sign Bobby if they in turn let him sign Benteke. Harry Maguire was on that hull team as well. And Jarrod Bowen. 'Most assists' somehow feels like underselling him. Lol. At his peak he was the best LB in the world. 8m for Robertson and sold them Kevin Stewart for 4m Indonesian Only if you (mis)pronounce it like many English commentators do. If you pronounce Salah the way Egyptians do, it sounds closer to the Hindi word for advice. Imo it's actually advice, that will be saala [deleted] In Kazakh it means lazy, careless (""салақ"") >2011 wasn't that long before 2017 (scientists estimate between 2–13 years) but I remember 22m having a lot more spending power when the Suarez transfer was made, that was no loose change at the time.  Yeah, Suarez was the 9th most expensive transfer of the 10/11 season according to Transfermarkt. For comparison, the 9th most expensive transfer of the 23/24 season was Hojlund at almost 74 million euros. That's a nearly 300% increase in 12 years, fucking mental to think about. Salah has done nothing for Hartlepool, mate. Liverpool had been pursuing Salah for ages though. They were the ones negotiating with Basel for months before Chelsea initially came in and paid the fee to never use him properly.   It's true Klopp wanted Brandt, but Liverpool's stat men had loved Salah for a long time before.   In a similar vein, Klopp wanted Gotze the year prior, but the stat men wanted Mane lol. Klopp wanted Brandt I heard. Liverpool told him, no we are giving you Salah. Diaz has had a big dip in form recently, at the time it was the best player at the Primeira Liga You're straight up smoking crack. They were all, thats why they're the best front 3 in world football at their peak, but Mane is still the most important.  Firmino has elite build up, but lack goals for a 9. Salah has goals, but stays up top and gets reprimanded by Klopp all the time for his pressing and build up.  Mane has both.   Results also proved it. we go from quadruple chasing to trophyless 5th placed once he moved. And we collect more points per game without Salah than with. Mane over Salah for sure.   Firmino has elite build up, but lack goals for a 9. Salah has goals, but stays up top and gets reprimanded by Klopp all the time for his pressing and build up.  Mane has both.  Results also proved it. we go from quadruple chasing to trophyless 5th placed once he moved. And we collect more points per game without Salah than with. It's also wrong, €8m for Coutinho is our best signing. Injuries and drive. He never seemed too arsed to give it his all except for a few appearances. he was on fire till he injured his knee in the cl semi against roma Really dumb comment, this They weren't. Can't be champions when you're sitting at 0 points by the end of the season.  Knee injury  Groin injury  Hip problems  Hamstring injury  Torn muscle fiber  Torn thigh muscle  Inner ligament injury  Those were all the different injuries he had before joining you at age 24. His body was weak and had already had one ligament injury in his knee so him getting an ACL was definitely not from nowhere Tell me you didn’t follow a player before they came to Liverpool without telling me…  He was a literal meme for being huge potential but injury prone. He didn’t jump up a level at Liverpool, he literally just steadily progressed his whole career. A career massively hampered by injuries - the reason he was sold in the first place rather than a nailed 1st team player. Given how quickly Klopp binned Sakho, our best CB at the time, for attitude issues I think this rumour is probably bollocks  Don't buy that at all - at least not as his time at Liverpool. Klopp didn't keep \*anyone\* around with an persistent attitude problem and wasn't scared to instantly get rid of players like that.  And you would see him go on the pitch, put in a shift, and then suddenly start limping/get injured mid-game - he wasn't faking that shit. this was a quote from Klopp that sounded like a joke rather than fact. We have no reason to doubt them being real injuries other than one journo saying something about his pain tolerance - as far as I can remember.  He does make himself a lot of chances, though.  All in all this chart is full of really good players.  Edit:  I'm an arsenal fan since I moved out and could pay for cable to watch the prem, so like 20 years, but I'm American.  I just try not to hate. I am from asia so rivalries r all banters to me at the end of the day. I use it to tease my friends & some colleagues when we win against any PL team. I don't hate any player, manager, etc i just don't have enough mental energy to think about all that stuff after work. Plus it's not a good thing to pray on someone else's downfall.  Work drains away all the energy from me these days. I hate being poor. Fantastic (and fitting) username I think there are different types of flops.  * Never leveled up (was good in a weaker team and didn't show it in a big team)  * Didn't fit the system   * Caused way too much drama  * Good player that never got the chance due to injury  All of these are flops but for me at least they are different. And I put the last one more in the unlucky pile. I agree, it's why I don't really argue when people say Grealish can never be called a flop because he was an important part of a CL win and league win even at 100m and struggling to start half the time at the club during his prime years.  I think Keita doesn't quite get the respect he deserves for being generally the preferred choice in a CL winning, 97 point team, still overall a flop but there's been far worse Spat out my drink Baby Hitler must be like Top 3 killable babies in all history Alvarez is a great player, why's everyone underestimating him Except the year Liverpool spent so much on Nunez, Alvarez came to City for 15m. I could throw salt in the wound and point out Alvarez scored the same amount of goals both years too.  It's a horrible time to buy a big name but you'd think plucky Liverpool could find diamonds in the rough and not rely on buying one of the big names in the market. He’ll learn, one day …. Hopefully. Still cant believe you sold him for more than Neves Wasn't he really good with Benfica in his last season? Our matches against you gave me the impression that Nunez was an excellent finisher.[Just look at the second goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye4hLe0_oe4) Alvarez has just been sold for the same amount and had pretty much the same return, 27 g/a in ~2,900 prem and euro minutes vs Darwin’s 24 g/a in ~2,500 mins. I think you're just not considering overall price inflation. I don't think a striker worthy of Liverpool's first team is ever going to cost less from now on. It’s too early to say this. His ceiling is ridiculous if he can learn to compose himself in front of goal. If he genuinely wasn’t good enough we would have shipped him out by now. Oh 100% mate. I think VVD more timing just the missing piece of the puzzle but Salah arguably best ever PL winger now for 36m is nuts. Only Kieta I'd say is a disappointment but more so his injuries, when he played was actually very good for us most of the time. Nunez has a solid G/A but still misses too many chances. This seems like a poor way to judge him, as MacAllister and Szobozslai were signed to do different jobs. And Dom’s role from last season will be different now. i agree with you, he had a good run of first 10 games and then was underwhelming and after his injury he was non existent And where are you seeing that?  It could be 20 goals scored and forty appearances for all you know. 1 more trophy lad. Same number of premier leagues, same number of champions leagues. That is not much greater success no matter what you say. The way people talk you should have 10 more trophies not 1 He's a weird player to me...He has everything you listed, but, most importantly, he has good positioning. His problem is that he can't score for the life of him. Even in the National team you see it: great chances, good positioning, crappy finish.  Maybe he will get better at it, but he already has a full season...And he didn't improve much in that regard. They always do this shit. Play the we don't have money/we don't spend like other clubs card. Meanwhile, during his tenure at the club, Liverpool spent €928 million on transfer fees. The irony of a Man City fan implying sarcastically that Liverpool spend a lot? No, the irony isn‘t lost on me. You know you can point out the flaws in our players without being a cunt right? Save the shitty attitude for rival fans. >upholding the standards  From your reddit account. Yes well done I get it, but he’s not a bad player & it’s hard not to see that he has the ability to be a top, top scorer. That’s why he needs the support as it’s clearly a mental thing.  Just support our players and encourage good output, let them and the coaches do their jobs.  If by the time Nunez leaves and he hasn’t improved then sure, we can be like ‘he’s a bum’ but whilst he’s still putting everything into representing my team, I’m gonna support him.  Remember Crouch? He went months without scoring. Lucas was despised by a large portion of our fan base before he became a cult hero. Suarez even with us struggled in his first few months by his standards that followed after. Exactly. 2 full years and still no improvement in his finishing, I take Jota over him every time. Google claims that the only £80m+ midfielders in the premier league history are Enzo caicedo rice and pogba He rocked up at Liverpool, a year after signing and couldn't speak a word of english.  He got his move and gave up, he had a poor final season at Leipzig as well. He never caused any problems at Leipzig I thought Mane probably kept him from full-on giving up. Regardless, it was unfortunate how it went and turned to be. The hype was bonkers, I saw a lot of those comps or a mix of Xavi with Gerrard. It had everything to go wrong. Let's not mince words here - he was a complete bust at Liverpool.    It only doesn't feel that way because he was fortunate enough to be carried by Liverpool's best ever Prem team, but purely based on value, I dare say he's their worst signing ever. Yeah, he ended up being a decent squad player. Keita didn't live up to the pricetag or hype, but he wasn't awful either, with him my reaction is more of a shrug than a shudder Adrian was fine apart from that one goal line clearance vs atletico where we were up and all we had to do was time waste. Gives it right back to them on a low scuffed clear and they score. Unforgivable. None of the others got injured from the air conditioning and their seat on the plane. I still see his shot in the final against Madrid in my dreams mate Meanwhile Thiago only had a FA Cup to show for and it was mostly won by our reserves team. Which is apparently such a controversial argument while discussing players today, they seem to be either the best ever or a flop, nothing in between. But in no world is he worth that fee currently. But harsh to put Szoboszlai in there just yet. He’s been inconsistent but it’s too early to really judge him Szobo hasn’t been playing the same role he thrived in before so i cut him some slack. I can’t think of any excuse for Nunez. I do it all the time in builders, Darwin o shots u SOT is a cash machine Not a complete flop by any means sure, but he was a failed transfer regardless.  Looking at hr rest of the list only Keita is a worse one, and all of them (except maybe Gakpo) were completely successes This!!! Ox was worth it for THAT goal alone > Acting like a player can only be a success or a flop is dumb.  Where did I say that? I said they could prove to be flops. That doesn't mean that's one of two outcomes. i don't see how diaz is I think they've been good players but for those prices I think it's fair to expect world class talent, or players who are going to guide their club to years of success and trophies. They haven't been around long enough for the latter, and I don't think they fit in the former, personally.  Maybe my metric is off there though. The range in quality of players for that price across football is so broad that it's hard to determine what you ""should"" be getting when you spend that much. I think Jota is definitely a quality player, but for the last couple of seasons he's struggled to be able to actually get himself on the football pitch consistently. Missed a lot of games due to injury and some of those he did play he was only getting cameo appearances. That being said, he does still look good, there's no question about his ability. I'd just want to see him be consistently available. I am quite literally saying that they are in the middleground but their time at the club is still ongoing and could still be positive or negative.  I'm not saying they should be bad. I'm saying its not worth discussing yet because we don't know. Quite literally said ""They haven't landed"" Is Havertz struggling? Many others succeeded so it's not that big of a deal Just isn't as strong as the English or Spanish league.   Although, I do prefer the Bundesliga and Serie A these days. Yeah, that would make sense.  Feel like he just mentally checked out I heard they have some very good doctors in Spain... Clowns like you who dont actually watch games and only stares at stat tables should never talk football. His output was impressive but his all around game is poor now. His athleticism has dropped off a cliff, he can no longer dribble past player, track back, or press effectively, which causes the system to suffer at Liverpool. I would have sold last summer, and would sell this summer. Especially with how entitled he acted when Klopp would sub him off. Then proceeded to use Firmino as a wingback.    Another fun fact is Rodgers obsession with Benteke apparently went on for 3 consecutive summers, and our old head of analytics recently did an interview (Ian Graham) and he believes Rodgers fighting the committee for so long meant we also missed out on Diego Costa.   Apparently we were going to approach Costa earlier in the summer, but Brendan wanted Benteke so it stalled. By the time we approached Costa and paid his original release clause, he'd already agreed to a new contract at Atletico.    Graham believes had we approached earlier, we'd have had a very good chance of turning Costa's head before he signed a new contract. > Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia; [baˈhasa indoˈnesija]) is the official and national language of Indonesia.[8] It is a standardized variety of Malay,[9] an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the multilingual Indonesian archipelago for centuries.  Is it wrong to refer to Indonesian as Malay? Genuine question, I know jack shit about Indonesia. The word is actually from Urdu but you are absolutely correct re the pronunciation. I pronounce it as like the English commentators and I'm from the North east region of India and here the wife's brother thing is pronounced same as the English commentary name for Salah :3 maafi  But the wife's brother Sala is pronounced as how in Salah more than the advice Saala Not yet anyway Oh haha, that is correct. and instead of mane, he wanted gotze. Aye he was, still a decent buy like, I just find Gakpo and Jota to be better buys   Like Diaz is in the Nunez category for me where the player has been good but not good enough for what we paid Gakpo is more versatile, scores more goals, assists more goals, and does much more defensive work  Diaz is objectively worse and cost more money than Gakpo, so yes Gakpo is a better buy than Diaz 😂😂😂 bruh Salah has more goals and assists every single season.  They're both wingers lmao it's not even close. Mane was sold 3 years ago, Liverpool rejected 150mil for Salah last year Mane rotted in Bayern and now Saudi league... When Salah was injured in the UCL vs Madrid, everyone instantly knew it was game over Nah no way, I get what you’re trying to say because of the amount of profit he generated, but in terms of impact Salah is up there with the likes of Dalglish, Keegan, Souness etc. Unless it was for country lol The plane AC ""injury"" springs to mind... [removed] What an extent to which not know how to read. Impressive.  He came as an injury prone player. What I said was that the story was different with us at the beginning, he was fit for long periods of time and looking like he could possibly get rid of his troubles until he did his knee, an injury that had not much to do with his history because it was a horrible challenge (completely fair challenge though) and anyone would have torn their ligaments there. He was out for longer than ever after that, and his fate was sealed.   Fuck you for being rude because it was free. You could have just discussed like you were a kind human being. He did bin him at one point and we had to bring him back because we lost literally every midfielder we had. Sakho was brought in by people who weren't there anymore tho, Klopp and his staff had no reason to fight for him if he wasn't up to it.  Doesn't matter how wrong you are, if you spend 60 million euros on a player, you're gonna be more lenient with them. At the end of the day if the player is ""injured"" they have a threshold that they could or would play through. Many of the top players have played many big games through injury/painkillers. And also it is ultimately up to them if they feel good enough to play (managed of course also by medical team).   Doing that excessively is also not right, but when your bar is missing a game due to aircon causing a stiff neck, then I think we can expect a little more for the salary being paid.  Sakho was doing things like turning up late to training, being disrespectful to Kloppo and airing dirty laundry on Instagram. He was dealt with immediately because that is an obvious attitude issue. Would be injured for us every single game, and then go play every match for his national team for 90 minutes. To be fair, I find it hard to actually hate anyone unless they’ve done something actually sinister, not score a goal or anything like that. I too enjoy using it for the banter though.  I hope football is something of an outlet to you to look forward to, that’s the beautiful thing about the sport, no matter where you’re from, your wealth or your social status, football is the same thing and it brings everyone together.  All the best bro, hope to see you around in the match threads giving each other some stick We are prepping the long game, he'd be a star in our Legends games in years to come. He was.  In his preferred situation though which is exactly that second goal. Space to run and little time to overthink it and just bury it.  He’s a good striker but it seems those problems are still present. I'd like to see Alvarez' chance conversion rate vs Darwins  But yeah they have very similar numbers. Both scored 20 goals in the Prem in around 65 games. But one is the main guy and one is second fiddle to Haaland. Love me some Darwin Nunez but Alvarez is a better player. Eye check alone is enough but even if you go the stats way they have the same numbers when Alvarez is a second fiddle at city. He isn't in our best 11 though at present. He's a squad player that we paid a record fee for, Jota is still better just not available as much.  He's not as big a flop as Keita but he was not a successful signing, even if that is the going rate these days. He'll get one more season to prove himself He's been here two seasons, is 25, and isn't in our best 11. Maybe he'll kick on, but as we are now he hasn't been worth a record fee he's just a squad player The post isn’t ab trophies. Klopp scouted, spent and sold better than other top clubs and consistent title contenders. It was great to see a prem club ran well. I’m madridista and have won 10 more trophies mi amigo I guess as Liverpool fans we just hope that Arnie brings something out of him in this season. They droned on and on about Klopps kids after the league cup final, meanwhile the guy who scored the winning goal is the most expensive defender in football. The last 5 years Chelsea (£-770m), Man U (£-505.76m), Arsenal (£-489.78m them spending is so odd), Tottenham(£-415.6m), Newcastle (£-343.3m), West Ham (£-266.25m), Liverpool (£-253.84m) and Villa (£-231.6m) have all outspent City (£-226.56m) but they apparently aren't ruining football, City are.   None of those teams won the league with their spends.  Klopp did an excellent job of balancing the books though at Liverpool. I would be less of a prick if our braindead fanbase weren't calling him ""captain chaos"" and saying shit likes going to bang 40 this season. we all have to start somewhere mate. we need to pressure the club into binning players that aren't good enough. crouch turned good after about 4 months. nunez has been here 2 years.   I never hated lucas either, he was a solid player at the start and then became very good later on. Lucas wasn't missing sitters every week or the defensive alternate to that which is giving up easy chances.   suarez didn't struggle. he wasn't clinical, but his all round game was light years ahead of nunez. he could actually stay onside for one. he had won the copa America for his country whilst nunez disappeared in the same situation.   nunez is a Europa league player at best. I can't wait til we flog him to some dopes and the rest of you can wake up from this collective brain rot. his finishing is getting worse if anything. he's got no brain. his performance at goodison was a genuine disgrace, how anyone can support him after that is a mystery. Lol, Pogba isn't who I was thinking of but he fits the brief best. Yank here:  Curious to know if it is customary for international players  where English isn’t a dominant language to learn English right after making a move to a league there? He also wasn't injured anywhere near as much at Leipzig. Things change he was still somewhat motivated to perform while he was at Leipzig. That does not appear to be the case ever since he left for Liverpool. https://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/keita-tackle-131398  I mean he put the captain in hospital after a bad tackle in training so maybe a little A mix of Xavi and Gerrard is somehow not computing for me at all but goddamn I'd love to see it. Can't believe he got the 8 after Stevie. Nah he's not our worst buy purely because we were successful regardless of his disappointing performance in that period and there were still periods of decent form from him tho nowhere near what we expected. I vividly remember us selling Torres for 50 m and bidding 15m then 25m then 35m for a young centre forward who'd played less than half a season in the top flight and was injured at the time of the bids. He scored a few goals in his 18 months, mostly in an FA Cup run that ended with Chelsea beating us in the final and Carroll failing to score a header from 3 yards out. He was notorious for getting black out pissed in Liverpool City Centre, spent half his time at the club injured and promptly fucked off to West Ham for around half of what we paid. At the time we signed him he was the 8th most expensive player in history, he'd only made 33 top flight appearances (scoring 14 goals), he begged Newcastle not to sell him to us and apparently cried on his way to his medical. Prior to us signing him he'd already been cautioned by the police once, plead guilty to common assault, charged with assaulting his girlfriend (subsequently dropped due to lack of evidence though his car was set on fire 2 days after he made bail), broke a teammates jaw and been sent home from England u19s for breaking curfew. He scored 11 goals in 58 games for us, with 2 of them being on his Anfield debut. He cost 35 million fucking pounds.    I remember us letting Alonso go to Madrid having fell out with Benitez after the latter tried to sell him the previous year so he could sign Gareth Barry. We subsequently failed to sign Gareth Barry, lost a world class midfielder and then dropped nearly 20 mil (which wasn't far off our club record at the time) on Alberto Aquilani who once again was injured when we bid. We went from 2nd with Alonso to 7th with Aquilani, he made 26 appearances in his first season played 2 uefa cup qualifiers in his second before being sent on loan to Juve, then Milan before we let him go on a free to Fiorentina.   Possibly worst of all I remember us declining to sign Anelka after a decent 6 month loan in favour of dropping about 10 mil on El Hadj Diouf who scored 2 on his Anfield debut in the league. He went on to score 1 more league goal that season and didn't score at all the following year becoming the only number 9 in Liverpool's history to go a full season without a goal. He did manage to get booked 14 times and sent off during the goal drought year and even in his prolific debut season (he scored 6 in all competitions) he caused fucking uproar by spitting at Celtic fans during a UEFA Cup game. We finished second prior to replacing Anelka with Diouf and then finished 4th and 5th the following year's. Diouf has gone on to slag off the Club, call Gerrard both shit and racist and slag off Carragher as well in between being a shit footballer, a racist, and a violent thug.  Keita being frequently injured and occasionally decent over the course of 5 years in which we won basically everything doesn't come close. I think, for the price, he's the only real ""fail"" on this list, with both Diaz and Darwin in the ""just okay"" camp. All the others were and are massive successes (Dom is still young and figuring it out too, I guess). Diaz and Darwin have time to turn it around, but Keita will always be seen as less successful because of his attitude and injuries. Not just inconsistent, but niggling injuries this season. When he landed and for his first few games, no shadow of a doubt he has the quality we need.   Nothing like nunez who still feels hard to judge - capable of great things..... And terrible..... But great!   Plus he's a lot of fun to watch, which buys him time. Ultimately, if this is what he is, we over payed, but I'm cool with it. Same like Nunez, he only arrived a season earlier than Szobo. I don't get Szobo's ""hate"" - saw most of his games at Liverpool and he never felt like having a negative impact on the game.   Darwin however... imagine how different the end of the season is if he scores vs Atalanta at home when it was still 0-0. If he cost £30/40m then yeah but he’s our 3rd most expensive signing and he was touted as the new Gerrard at the time.   Not saying that was warranted or he’s been a flop at all, but need to do a lot more next season Yeah that's fair, generally that is how football fans talk about transfers but can't assume that's how you think 👍 Looking back at his record maybe I have a more positive picture of Diaz at Liverpool than he has deserved. His first 6 months after signing were electric, but i guess he's not been able to kick on from that with an injury hit subsequent season and a pretty good rather than very good 23/24. 40-50 million simply isn't that much money anymore in top-flight football. They've been good players who have contributed significantly to Liverpool's recent successes, and i think that's enough to say they were good signings at that level. I thinks it's more about different surroundings, roles, systems and so on   Dembele played great in the CL or against Bayern, but struggled in Spain against lesser half teams that were much worse Eh it has nothing to do with ""strong"", there are many Bundesliga players who went to those league and succeeded But can they heal the big sad? drip doctors? Shame he’s in Brazil now I hope you grow into a better person, I really do. This is the real answer to Klopp's question: how did we get this guy? Nope, just taking a piss a bit because we Indonesian and Malaysian have some sort of bad blood with each other > here the wife's brother thing is pronounced same as the English commentary name for Salah  Yes, that was part of my point. English commentators (mistakenly) say something close to साला. As far as I know there are no regional differences in the pronounciation of साला in Hindi so yeah it would be the same everywhere.  The other part of my point is that साला isn't how Mo himself says his name, or any other Egyptian (or even Arabic speaker). It is closer to सलाह, which is a different word in Hindi, meaning advice. >I pronounce it as like the English commentators  You're pronouncing his name wrong Isn't he Mohammad सलाह? We had a player called Mo Sylla a few seasons a go, but he was a DM. He was good until he staged a revolt with a few games if the season left. Then we got relegated.  I'd still probably have him back if he fancied it like. Gakpo does far less defensive work, scores the same amount despite playing most of his minutes as a striker and they have the same amount of assists. Once again, despite Gakpo playing centrally and assists being a meaningless stat. Look at stats like chances created, and key passes, where Diaz absolutely destroys Gakpo. Nunez being unable to finish is hardly a slight on Diaz's playmaking abilities.   Genuinely, you've watched Gakpo bag a few in the Euros against shite opposition and now think he's the best thing since sliced bread. Get a grip. Re read what I wrote, illiterate. Lol. Without Coutinho money we wouldn't have bought both Ali and Virgil Yeah, Salah is great. But ""who is the greater player"" is not the topic.  The topic is who is the best signing. The money spent being just €8m leading to him being sold for €140m and netting us Alisson and Virgil is the best piece of transfer work we have done. Reddit knowledge of how penalties for financial infractions work. Seems like independent viewers of our comments don’t agree with you bud.  That may have been what you meant but it’s really not what you said. The thesis of the comment you replied to was: “his injuries were predictable”… you started your reply with “not entirely true for us”… he wasn’t a new player for you, he had the same injury record - that’s what I was making fun of. Not in a mean or oppressive way and I’m sorry if you took it that way - tone is hard on the internet.   As for the being rude thing… reread my comment… you may have read it as rude but really I was just jokingly pointing out Oxe was crazy injury prone his whole career. No personal attacks just a gentle rib. Meanwhile, reread your comment just now… I’m not the problem here, bud. Sorry for any offense caused but come on… Agree with every word u said. especially football being an outlet to look forward to. I just quit online gaming as i used to get frustrated because i used to lose because of playing solo. Then i used to keep on playing till i won & after winning used to keep on playing till i lost or until my phone's battery was dead.   For now i only watch football & don't get too attached to it. If we lose we lose. I watched liverpool beat united 5-0 & 7-0 both matches till the end & didn't lose my cool. U need to detach yourself a little to enjoy the game. Nunez isnt the main guy? But maybe more minutes than Alvarez just  Edit : no Alvarez played more minutes Alvarez played in the team that won the title and Liverpool had just signed a completely new midfield?  Comparing players playing in different teams in different systems is never going to be completely accurate Honestly, Trent to Darwin feels like a winning strategy. Maybe it won't work, but I still think the decision making in getting Darwin was very solid and I do hope Darwin gets his shit together and drills is finishing under pressure until he can score in his sleep. He’s definitely in our best 11? I don’t know what you’re talking about here to be honest. Yes, if he never improves and this is his level then we overpaid, but I doubt that he won’t improve. There’s too much clear and obvious potential to his game for him to not get better. To a Madrid fan everything is about trophies.  > Klopp scouted, spent and sold better   LOL, there’s not a chance you believe Klopp did all this. Trying to give him sole credit for three things he definitely wasn’t involved in is laughable. Social media is never going to affect the club's transfers, the only possible impact is hurting the players mental health if they get abused and that doesn't help the club That Newcastle game was the best it gets I think, don't see him contributing massively this season. I think both Chelsea signings haven't succeeded yet but they are both very young so plenty of time Pretty standard that any player moving to a league where they don’t speak the local language will make *some* effort to learn the basics at least. Although English players moving abroad are notoriously bad at this (as befits the national stereotype). I think it's like if someone can't give a basic interview in English after their first season, people will strt to talk about attitude problems. To give some perspective on the reverse situation, I think Liam Brady and Kevin Keegan were among the first British and Irish players of that era to really immerse themselves abroad with the respect to language and culture etc in italy and Germany respectively. Does make sense to learn the language of the place where you are going to live in.  When i applied to move to the UK for my studies, they asked me to prove my language proficiency , which perfectly made sense. He knew he was signing for 12 months in advance. No one cares you’re a yank  Piss off yank Maybe Zidane would be the closest I could imagine as a cross between the two in recentish memory. Fabregas, not perfect but closest I can imagine You're kinda making my point for me, by evaluating Keita purely based on the team around him, and not on his individual performances.    Individually he is by far the biggest flop I've seen at Liverpool, based on how much he cost, how long he stayed and how little he contributed during that time, with his attitude and injuries (and there have been suggestions since that he was playing them up to avoid playing), and how much we recouped when he eventually left.    And trust me, I've seen the likes of Carroll, Aquilani, Diouf, and many others long before them since the Prem era started. At least each of them didn't stay as long stinking up the place and we still got a decent amount back when we finally sold them.    If Keita was in any of those teams they were in (like say the 2012-2016 team), he'd have absolutely nowhere to hide at all, as our most expensive midfield signing ever. Curious to know what makes you feel like Diaz and Darwizzy are just OK?  (For context I don’t watch every Liverpool match and I’m also aware of the finishing issues that Darwizzy has as well) I think just off the bottom of that list are two other failures: Ox and Thiago. And the all were failures for the same reason – injuries – at the same time, in the same team, leaving us massively short in midfield.  Only one gets the wild hate. And part of that is definitely the hype/fee. But only part. The other section is... predictable. Start of the season he was an absolute beast, the end of the season he was a liability. His first touch just lets him down a lot. He’s quality but I think the only nailed on starter at midfield is Macca. I don't think Darwin is a flop but he's definitely underperformed so far, szobo I think it's that he came in looked incredible for the first few months and then just seemed to run out of steam.  Second half of the season he wasn't bad but he gave away the ball a lot more and just didn't look like the same player, hopefully he's had enough time to recover and regain his form Touting anyone is the next Gerrard will flop. I’m sure you know how big that title is on someone the only midfielder i could think off in the world that could fit the mould is either De Bruyne or Jude anyone else doesn’t come close. I agree he needs to do more next season though right now him and nunez aren’t flops nor massive success they’re more in the wait and see category ok but why would he be touted as a next Gerrard? he was never that kind of player from anything I ever saw > he was touted as the new Gerrard at the time.  He also played like that for the first couple of months, which is a large reason for the disappointment when his form dropped. he started well and is good at dribbling which always leads to players being rated high. he's not bad but his end product is terrible Fair enough. I think we see quite a lot of better or higher contribution players move for a similar amount to other clubs. Jota has also had a lot of injury or playtime issues, which leaves me with questions. Blood bags we hope you start watching football and stop disgracing Liverpool fans with that casuality. we really do. The word শালা also means wife's brother in Bangla. Though we pronounce it like ""shala"". Yes it is but I guess I'm inclining more (cuz I say it the same way) towards the English pronunciation of his name  If going by how he pronounces it it's definitely more like the word Advice Diaz's finishing isn't great.  I agree that Diaz has been better for Liverpool than Gakpo but I think Gakpo could definitely end up being a better transfer in the end, he's younger and klopp admits he made a mistake trying to turn him into a cf I completely agree with you and have been unsuccessfully arguing on his behalf. After the Euros this sub ran with the gakpo > Diaz narrative and pretty much turned on Diaz. Seen plenty of comments here with people praying that other teams buy him.   Sad to see fans turn on someone who played a major role in getting them their only silverware last season.  Bruh I've watched both for Liverpool for a while now and Gakpo is straight better  Gakpo does more defensive work, he presses more, he tackles more, and he intercepts more.  Gakpo gets more goals per 90 despite playing out of position. Gakpo gets more assists per 90 despite playing out of position. Gakpo straight up got more goals and assists last season in all comps and he played 600 less minutes. In the prem alone he got the same number of goals and assists and played 1000 less minutes. Despite Diaz playing in his best position all season they achieved the same number of xA per 90 with Diaz actual assists matching hid xA whole Gakpo actually overperformed.  Shot creation Diaz does have more, but actual goal creation Gakpo has more. So gakpo's chances are better quality despite playing out of position for most of the season  Maybe you need to actually look at how we've played. Gakpo scores more, assists more, creates better chances, does more defensively, etc.   We have 3 forwards where we actually get less points per match when they're on than off, but with 2 of those players we have a higher xG than opponents. The only player where we get more points without them and stats wise we do worse is diaz.  Anyone that's actually been watching us last season and still thinks Diaz is better than Gakpo is mad 😂😂😂 nothing can save the embarrassment mate I get that, but look past the money generated, was Countinho’s impact at the club greater than Salah’s? It wasn’t, therefore Salah has been the better signing. Greatest transfer is an open ended topic, buying Salah has lead to us winning every single trophy and him becoming one of our all time top goal scorers. I’d say that beats anything that Coutinho ever did for the club. [removed] He was supposed to be. He isn't because he hasn't been good enough Alvarez has had more minutes Of course, but in this case specifically Alvarez is the better player until proven otherwise. I think Jota is clearly a better player Pretty sure they got the money to afford a Top Top Top Tutor. Got it makes sense.   I guess in Europe it’s different because they teach more than one language throughout the entire education process from an early age, depending on the country.   I always thought it was awesome that so many great players usually spoke 2 or 3 languages: (Ibra, CR7, ZZ)   Pulisic was always class to me for learning German right away, did me proud.   Over here for example in baseball, it’s customary for a lot of Latin American and Caribbean players never learn English and have a translator with them pretty much at all times. Yes I definitely see where that comes from, great point. Lineker did at Barcelona as well Truly riveting stuff  Have you ever considered being a professional cunt?  🤠🤠🤠 Dya know what I can sort of see what you mean. In his Arsenal days he had that La Masia class and composure combined with a bit of steel, aggression and a sort of lead by example attitude. My own personal thought was Xabi Alonso tbh. Whatever lad. Keita's performances far out rank all three of the players I've named. You've just for an agenda and I can't be arsed repeating myself. Both have finishing/final product issues. Diaz seems to have won over most of the fanbase, and he's incredible at dribbling don't get me wrong, but his lack of final pass/proper finish/etc. makes me in the ""he's done well but not great"" camp. Diaz is just a lot of flair and not a ton of linkup imo. He works his fucking ass off though, they both do, so I love em both just for that. Don’t watch Liverpool enough but what about Endo? Isn’t he nailed? I’m not saying it was right but it happened. Mainly because he was a big money midfield signing who was given the number 8. It was exactly the same with Keita. Probably will be for any future midfield signing who wear the 8 I think it mostly comes from a youtube idiot called Grizz, a fake ITK who I'm not even sure is much of a Liverpool fan outside of his streaming 'career.' I mean I bought it since he was an 8 with banger goals every other game initially. Diaz is by no means clinical, especially this last year, but to be fair his mental state can't have been the best given everything he went through with his parents.   He is young and could still grow, for sure. But he'll never cut it as a winger in the premier league. Too slow, especially with the ball at his feet. Unless he's able to massively improve that, making him play centrally is correct. It's wild how far people run with a narrative on the sub, tbh. In a month after Diaz had a couple of good performances and Gakpo remains on the bench the opinions will flip back, and they'll pretend to have never said a bad word about Diaz. I've been watching every match since before you were born, mate. Watching ""for a while"", is hardly gonna push the needle on your argument.  Gakpo literally does far less defensive work. Diaz covers far more ground than any other forward, which is a large part of why he was Klopps first choice whenever fit.  You say ""despite playing out of position"", as if that's somehow a point in Gakpos favour. Man's played as a striker and barely managed to score the same amount as a winger. That's not a positive. Gakpos stats when playing as a winger for Liverpool are far worse than Diaz, as well, which is another big reason Gakpo barely got a look in.   It's quite easy to tell you're new to the game, and there's nothing wrong with that, but try to ease yourself in. You're making yourself look like a boisterous American. This is why Klopp embarrassed Salah benching him then having a go at him and have Liverpool fans back Klopp up. Lol. Left clowns like you.  😂 Is salahs impact greater than vvd and Alison's combined? >I don’t think we’ll ever do a **better transfer** than Salah for €42 Million again.  Here you started the topic: Salah is the best transfer.   You did not start the topic: Salah is the best player.  I explained that you are wrong, Coutinho is the better transfer, but obviously he is not a better player. You then tell me that Salah is a greater player.  I don't think you are paying attention to what either of us are saying. The army of lawyers and diplomats might pile enough pressure on the government to prevent it, sure. Doesn't change that the last time city won any trophy was Aguero on the final matchday. I mean he was supposed to be a competitor for Haaland since Liverpool couldn't get Haaland. Few strikers in the entire world right now would be good enough to compete against Haaland I would not trade Nunez for Alvarez so we'll have to agree to disagree. Jota is an elite finisher but often times offers little else to the team if he doesn’t poach his goal. Darwin elevates the whole team with his movement and workrate, opens up a lot of space behind him and offers a physical presence to defenders. I’m not seeing how he’s clearly better unless you only value finishing for this position. But they also have so much money that not speaking the local language isn't really an inconvenience to them. > Pulisic was always class to me for learning German right away, did me proud.  Not to downplay it, but when you understand one germanic language, it's ""easy"" to learn another one than say jumping from spanish to english. It can't barely speak a lick of german, but when I hear someone speak it, I immediately pick up on the cognates and sometimes feel like I have an idea of what they are saying.  You also have to take into account that Pulisic at the minimum had a middle class upbringing while many of those caribbean and LATAM players come from extreme poverty and have faaar difference concerns than learning a new language in a different country. Never underestimate the huge advantage a good upbringing provides. Nah ur country’s got that on lock It's not just about performances. It's about how he performed relative to his cost.   I never said he was the worst Liverpool player ever. There are far far more squad players and budget transfers who wouldn't even come close to Keita's worst performances for us.   I'm just pointing out how he's quite clearly our worst transfer ever, all things considered. I'm not sure what we ever got out of him. Hell, even with Carroll and Diouf I can recall 1-2 match winning performances.  Got it.   I feel like he can be frustrating at times. But from what I’ve seen when he played at Porto he can score too, so maybe he will eventually put it together.   As far as Darwizzy goes I really think he should be a top scorer for you guys this year coming up. I feel like he’s been really unlucky at times but I sense a monster season coming up from him. He needs to pay those civil lawsuits that are a-coming from the great state of North Carolina. As you said can't base everything off a few games but he definitely wasn't slow at the euros and him driving forward with the ball at his feet is when the Netherlands looked most threatening.  Honestly the second half of last season I feel like the forwards got a lot of flack for their poor finishing and it was frustrating to watch, but our defence was conceding first pretty much every game so I feel like the forwards shouldn't take all the blame Just checking in to gloat about how right we were 😂 Clearly not been watching last season then because Diaz was worse than Gakpo.   In what world does Diaz do more defensive work? Gakpo gets more tackles, more successful tackles, more challenges, more successful successful challenges, more blocks, more interceptions, and more clearances. Presses better too hence his play in midfield  That is a point in his favour, he played 1000 less minutes than Diaz and out of position and still equalled his goal and assist tally in the prem, then in all comps outscored him. Gakpo's stats when he's a winger are even better  It's quite easy to tell you just don't like Gakpo because by eye test Gakpo is better, statswise Gakpo is better, only thing Diaz has is flair but that's pointless if there's no end product on him.  Diaz has been here for over 2 years now and hasn't improved as well. There's a reason why everyone on our sub is happy to replace him with Gordon or someone else.  American? You're so weird man Americans aren't even up yet. The fact that you can't even back up your statements and you're just resorting to insulting me kind of proves you're wrong What? 😂😂😂 you're comparing a 1 match bench after a 3month injury to getting sold in your ""prime"" years LMAOOO Says a lot that you defend a child predator too. Disgusting Again, I get what you’re trying to say, but I’d rather not be an accountant and look at the transfers that way haha. Looking at a transfer and basing it on impact at the club makes much more sense from a fans perspective, getting a good deal is great and all but it shouldn’t really worry fans too much. You’re ignoring what I’m saying also, we’ll just agree to disagree. Delusional No one other than a few of the press making sensationalist headlines ever thought that (they’re totally different players). Liverpool were never in for Haaland and just because they signed a striker at the same time as City signed Haaland doesn’t make him a competitor for Haaland, he’s a freak of nature and no one is expected to rival his goal tally. I think Jota is far more intelligent and clinical. Yes Nunez is chaotic but it rarely results in anything. His touch and link up play are poor which means he kills a lot of attacks coz Salah and Diaz are just technically miles ahead of him and he can't keep up. He's better off the bench for me when he's running at tired defenders.   Slot also values an intelligent 9 with good positioning and technical ability too which based on what we've seen so far, Jota is clear at. His issue is injuries.   Again, if Nunez becomes more clinical, and much more intelligent then he could be the 9. But at the moment his only redeeming quality is his movement and work rate. German is rated more difficult for native English speakers to learn than Spanish by the FSI, which is involved in training US diplomats   https://www.businessinsider.com/map-shows-hardest-languages-to-learn-2017-12 Makes sense. I still can’t understand when certain languages are spoken around me so I feel pretty ignorant to not be able to pick up on which is which.  I get what you’re saying in regard to upbringing and economic opportunities but a lot of Major League systems have baseball facilities in those countries and offer free English classes to the prospects who sign with them so they can learn but there are plenty that choose not to. Hence a lot of bench coaches who are bilingual for that sole purpose of translating for the player. But yeah it definitely factors in for sure. You seem to think that money in football is unaffected by inflation. All three of the players I named were close to or in Carrolls case literally our most expensive purchases ever. 20 mil for Aquilani in 2009 is easily equivalent to 50 odd mil in 2017. He played 40 games in a season in which we were 2 games away from a fucking Quadruple and you're arguing the toss about whether Keita is a worse signing than Diouf. Go and watch the 5 nil game against United again and tell me Diouf or Aquilani had better games for us. He was a massive disappointment but he made over 100 appearances, helped us win literally ever trophy while he was here and his signing never negatively affected the team. You're doing my head in now. *please* stop calling him Darwizzy.  Makes him sound like some YouTuber idiot. It did look threatening, when they faced opposition of a lower calibre. Physical standards are way higher in the prem.   Absolutely agree on the second part. Think the pressure of it being Klopps final season just got to the lads. Absolute knobheads the lot of em 😂 >Clearly not been watching last season then because Diaz was worse than Gakpo.  Anyone who watched last seasons opinion, would be that Gakpo is a pretty mediocre striker we'd be lucky to flog off to Southampton for 10-15m, whilst Diaz is an Elite Winger who has some of the biggest clubs in the world sniffing around for him.   >In what world does Diaz do more defensive work? Gakpo gets more tackles, more successful tackles, more challenges, more successful successful challenges, more blocks, more interceptions, and more clearances. Presses better too hence his play in midfield  Yeah, this is where it gets embarrassing. Random defensive stats compared between different positions and roles in the system, literally mean less than nothing. Tarkowski beats Van Dijk in all those categories, do you reckon Tarkowski is a better defender?   In the type of press we utilised last season, Diaz's job isn't to directly win the ball, it's to force the opponents to play the ball into certain areas and players (adjusted depending on opposition). He needs to hound the fullbacks and right centre back into making passes that are more risky, and to players who are exposed from several different players. Diaz does that outstandingly, due to a combination of pace, willingness to put his own body on the line and a continuous absurd work rate.    Gakpo, presses from the front far worse. He doesn't have the stamina, work rate or pace to do so effectively. Pressing is also not a single skillset, pressing as a midfielder is very different from pressing as a forward. A midfielder needs to be far more cautious, as being caught out exposes you at the back.   >That is a point in his favour, he played 1000 less minutes than Diaz and out of position and still equalled his goal and assist tally in the prem, then in all comps outscored him. Gakpo's stats when he's a winger are even better  Yes, as a striker. I get that you're new to football, but it should be pretty obvious even to you, that a striker is presented with far more goal opportunities, and should score significantly more than a winger.   As a winger for Liverpool, Gakpo has 3 goals in 1131 minutes, and 2 of those were against Sparta Prague in the 2nd game, when we were already through. So 1 goal in 1040 minutes. And that's better? Let me guess, you didn't watch the Atlanta game where he got to play Left Winger for 90 minutes and was a major part of why we were completely ineffective offensively and got ran through defensively?  >Diaz has been here for over 2 years now and hasn't improved as well. There's a reason why everyone on our sub is happy to replace him with Gordon or someone else.  Our sub are fucking morons. They literally thought Jordon Ibe was going to be better than Sterling. They moaned about signing Mane and Firmino. Diaz has improved, and is a genuinely sought after player, who we're struggling to hold onto. Gakpo is not.   >American? You're so weird man Americans aren't even up yet. The fact that you can't even back up your statements and you're just resorting to insulting me kind of proves you're wrong  Americans are the ones who get obsessed with meaningless stats they don't understand, and parade them around like it's some form of objective proof. It's not of course. Statistics in sports are all about interpretation, making them as subjective as anything else. You can't back your statements up whatsoever, but think quoting a stat makes it true. Which is mostly pretty funny, but also makes you look like an American. No, we will not agree on anything when you lie about what I'm doing. I haven't ignored anything you are saying, but you yourself do not understand what you originally said.  >I don’t think we’ll ever do a **better transfer** than Salah for €42 Million again.  This is your first comment, you are saying ""better transfer"". Those words mean something.  I explained why this statement is wrong and then you start lying about me instead of argue against what I said, probably because you know you were wrong. Yes, thinking that you can funnel as much slave money as you want into a team defying the rules is pretty delusional, I agree. I just picked a random language as an example, but good info. Most of those MLB players learn and can understand English but prefer to communicate through a translator to shield themselves from the media. Look at Sammy Sosa, a man who spoke English for more than a decade, pretending to only speak Spanish when he was called in front of congress to testify about steroid usage. Lol mate, I want some of the inflation you're having that has more than doubled your spending power in under a decade.   Your argument is that he's not a bad signing because we still won all those trophies with him in the squad, while literally admitting that we won them ""regardless of him"".  He will forever be dubbed:  #Sir“Darwizzy”Nunez   For his uncanny exploits in shithousery  I bid thee a marvelous day old chap Right you're actually just wrong. Southampton for 15m? I can see why I shouldnt even take you seriously when you think a player who is not playing in their best position but still otdoes a bunch of other players is only worth 15m  Diaz is not an elite winger lol. He has 8 goals and he started near every game in his best position. That's a terrible return for a 50m winger in their 3rd season with a top teamm In our system our wingers scored goals and created chances. Diaz barely scored goals and didn't assist enough despite playing an extra 1000 minutes.   Diaz is ok at pressing, Gakpo is better as he times it better and actually leads the press. Diaz just goes at them like a worse Nunez  It should be pretty obvious to you that a left winger playing out of position and with far less minutes shouldn't be outscoring our starting left winger.   Not all of those minutes were at left wing, or did you not watch the games?  Brother you're not a Liverpool fan all I've seen you do it shit on players except Diaz, our worst forward. Diaz hasn't improved, he's actually got worse thanks to his injury. And good we should be selling him, he's not good enough for us while Gakpo actually is. Gakpo is younger, gets more goal contributions, is better defensively, is better at pressing, and is versatile. Diaz is a player who can play 2 positions and barely gets us goals.  Yes stats require context, and the context is Diaz played in his best position all season and was still our least effective attacker while Gakpo played out of position, across the entire front line and in midfield, and still was more effective than Diaz You failed to account for the value Salah brought to the club. Liverpool could easily have sold him for 140 million when he was younger, but they sold coutinho instead because Salah was worth more than that to them Lying to you? Where have I lied? I just gave my opinion as to why I think it’s a better transfer and you’re treating transfers as some binary black and white view, opinions come in to play. That’s why I’m saying we’ll agree to disagree because we both clearly have different opinions on the matter which is okay, no need to get so pressed. Mate, get outside and touch some grass, this is really not that important.  Lol the weirdo getting all in a huff has blocked me I know your life depends on this so I’m rooting for you buddy but the case against city doesn’t even include most of the seasons where city just won the league.  You don’t know what you’re talking about and this is pure cope That’s a great point bro, I forgot about Sammy. Do you think football follows real world inflation? How much of a test do you feel like for your Diaz takes now? Lmfao >You’re ignoring what I’m saying  You lied right here. I get that it's difficult for someone incapable of tying their shoelaces together to comprehend basic legal processes, but the following seasons will be prosecuted after the current case is over. Unlike the UAE, the FA doesn't have an endless amount of slave money to pour into legal proceedings. He's playing far, far better than he has for the past 2 seasons lol, Slot has clearly helped him Sure it does buddy, best of luck with that! He's been slightly more clinical, otherwise he's playing exactly as he opened last season. Which you'd know if you were a fan and not some todger talking utter shite. If he keeps this form up then great, but no he was our worst attacker by far last season  Also before the goals, he lost the ball a ton and misplaced many passes. He then got goals so who cares about the other poor stats? Absolutely nobody because he's done his job"
