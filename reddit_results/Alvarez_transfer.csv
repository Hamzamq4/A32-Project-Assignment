Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Top 5, all flops I always hate looking at this list because of the top 5. Fuck Bartomeu. The Neymar to PSG transfer really distorted the market. 2019 was an expensive year Coutinho might be the best business we've ever pulled off as a club and I can't see it being beaten ever again  -> Sign him as a young prospect from Inter Milan for £8.5 million in 2013  -> He gradually becomes one of the best attacking midfielders/wingers during a point in the clubs history when where we were average at best and shite at worst (13/14 being a huge fluke and an exception to the rule)  -> We sell him for more tham £140 million quid to Barcelona after he had a world class first half of the 17/18 season   -> We knock Barcelona out of the Champions League the following year and go on to win the entire thing with Van Dijk, Alisson and Fabinho (all of whom Barca and Coutinho paid for) being vital to our success Why are bonuses added for some players and not for all of them Adjusted for inflation, Ronaldo probably still tops this top 10, and Zidane the all time list? The Joao Felix deal is surely one of the strangest in history. Has never been close to living up to the price tag. Putting Neymar at 'only' €88M is being generous to Bartomeu. The contrast in success level between the top 5 and the bottom 5 (barring Alvarez who remains to be seen) is hilarious  Bale, Ronaldo, Neymar and Bellingham were/have been absolutely resounding successes that were worth their fees and then some in terms of trophies won and individual successes,  meanwhile Dembele, Coutinho, Hazard, Griezmann and Felix would all potentially top a ""worst signings of all time"" list. (alongside Kepa and Lukaku to be turn the gun on myself for a second) 3 of the top 5 - thanks a lot, Bartomeu Lol, the top 5 I was gonna say the first two are pretty funny, but then I kept reading and it was actually the first five. What did Santos do with the Neymar money? I wonder what a Brazilian team does with that much of an influx Barca will forever be taking strays even in the most innocent posts. Even when no one is firing any shots, they manage to get shot just due to these facts. Barcelona had the most expensive squad in the history of football in 2010s I can see the reason why Camp Nou has the word ""Spotify"" on it. I remember being so mad at coutinho lol still won’t forgive him but thanks for the salah, Vvd, Alisson money buddy  the Kylian Mbappe deal would've been the most expensive transfer at 180M.  NAK is truly an idiot.... Crazy that top 5 were all flops. Coutinho was good business for Liverpool. Bad karma for Barcelona for tapping up Liverpool players like Mascherano and Suarez. Barca's flop transfers except for Neymar, which they couldn't hold for long to make better from good.. Damn most of these flopped or eventually flopped. Wild Top 5 flops  4 of the next 5 - Absolute bangers and 3 of them legends (Jude too early to tell).   Let's see how Julian goes. I wonder what the actual cost of that Neymar deal was. The 88 mill for Neymar is that the price that came out later as the final price? Because I feel like I remember it being 50-55 mill in the news at one point? That is one troubled list. 1. Massive flop  2. Flop  3. Flop  4. Massive flop  5. Flop  6. Great buy  7. Good buy  8. N/A  9. Great buy  10. Good buy [deleted] Those 3 signings broke Barca's financially!! bale the goat Hot Take: Atleti overpaid for Alvarez. He’s a good player so he won’t be a Dembele like flop, but Lautaro Martinez out produced for Argentina this past summer, he’s a tweener who benefited from being on a stacked Man City team. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. Thanks again Coutinho  Liverpool legend coutinho. 4/9 hit rate yikes In this picture tells how Barca has done some bad business and at the same time the best turnover from Neymar with his massive release clause. Four of this were by Barcelona and only one of 'em panned out. This table shows what went wrong with Barcelona's finances. Also, the only Barcelona played that succeeded from this list made a shock exit that initiated the club's downfall. 2019 was a tragic year, lmao This also explains why Barca is so broke lol top 5 all flopped while 4/5 in the botttom 5 did amazing. shows money isn't always the best. u need smart signings Since Neymar’s former agent sued Barça last year, we now know Neymar transfer was 150M Thanks you Barto and I would never forgor Coutinho banging those goals for Bayern during 8-2 lmao, and now Laporta is challenging  your legacy despite winning one title league. The top 4 are just so comically bad This list is shit. Why include add ons for some players but not for others. Bellingham has €30m worth, most of which is now already owed. So the key is not spending over 105m. Why is my team toping this list I still can't understand how Madrid got Bellingham at that price Basically Barca should stick to La Masia  Wow. And fucking Barça fans wonder why they're broke as fuck. Stupid ass decision making. Yeesh Barcelona transfer business is so fucking funny. COMELA CRISSSSSSS This is fucking hilarious  Barca spewing the neymar money everywhere.   We'd be in a very different football world if that money was spent even reasonably well. Top 5 all flops the worst top 5 😭 literally the worst transfers ever 💀 Ronaldo being on this list even still 15 years later is pretty incredible considering how much transfer fees have soared ik the last 5-6 years What are the top 10, excluding the big 3 Something was in the water in 2019. Can’t thank Barca enough for this safe to say top 5 transfer has failed to live up to their price tag. Ugh Can someone smarter than me tell me what Ronaldo and Bale would have been in 2024 euros? Eden really triggered all those add-ons :D No wonder barca have no money, then complain. Always insane when i remember Griezmann cost that much. At the end of the day, it is not always about spending the biggest money on transfers. Ah Ronaldo, 10 years later you would worth 1BN. heheheheheh Barca really wasted the Neymar money lol Am sure, if u expand this list to 15, suarez would somewhere be between 11-13.   To think no:9,10 and 11 were the best transfers out of this lost. Special mention to Bale ofcourse, Damn Barca have sure blown a lot of money 3/4 for Barca = lol 3/4 for Real = 💪 Hazard costs us more than that, there were addons that gave Chelsea money, even after he was gone, as I recall Top 5 all were worth that amount but all flops funny that the top 5 were a massive flop 1-5 were peak scams Paying 138 mil for Coutinho only for him to buttfuck you in Champion league in a Bayern uniform is nasty work. Hazard was 160 million. There’s some other players who’s bonuses were reached but not included in the graphic as well. Hazard is probably 1# with all the subsequent addons. Hazard is not a flop. He was just the world's most expensive good luck charm Yet it’s somehow Madrid that are “ruining football” lol Hah, so Bale in fact cost more than Cristiano I can see the reason why Camp Nou has the word ""Spotify"" on it. Jesus Spanish clubs are shit at transfers ain’t they Top 1 Mbappe 150m sign fee Literally all flops except for Bellingham and CR7 While the bottom 4 (discounting Álvarez since it's just happened) have all been successes. Yeah really no other way to slice and dice it. Hazard’s body let him down, I wish he would’ve made the move to Madrid earlier in his career.  Agree with the first four on the list, but was Griezman really that bad for Barca or is it because of the price they paid for him? I remember watching him there and he wasn’t half as bad as people make it out to be, the whole club was going through a rebuild and he was one of the players that put on decent performances afaik I'd argue that Felix has been alright in couple of seasons, and Griezmann was actually really good in Barcelona: it's just him being played out of his position and general instability in the club exactly at the time he arrived didn't help the image. But him personally, he delivered: he was one of the hard carriers in 20/21 season in particular when Barca won the Spanish Cup  The other three I do agree fully, big flops Massive fees tend to lead to massive letdowns though- if you did the top 10 in most countries half of each one would be flops. This list should have been adjusted for inflation. Then Alvarez should not be in top 10 and the first 5 are even more ridiculous Griezmann and Demebele were not flops, and Barca eventually sold them for a good amount of money.  The biggest undeniable flop in that list was Hazard, then Felix, then Cou. Then you have two transfers that undeniably were worth that kind of money (CR7 and Neymar). So you have two hits, three flops and 5 transfers inbetween/too early to tell. We should consider the list from number 6 then. Ronaldo would have been in the top 5 if you adjust for inflation (football inflation, not RPI) Griezmann? Idk about that Next 5, all bangers (Alvarez TBC) Phillipe Floppe was 1st 😅 Depends on your point of view. Coutinho was an amazing, transformative transfer. A real triumph for the sporting leadership team that led directly to a domestic, European, and world championship.... at Liverpool. Dembélé won several domestic titles (3 La liga, 2 Copa and 3 Supercopa) with Barça, that's more than Henry with Arsenal for example. He also was La liga's best assist provider and best chance creator for a couple of seasons (Aubameyang/Lewandowski years). How is that a flop?  Oh yeah we are on r/soccer.  Edit: Griezmann was disappointing (for those who never watched him) but he wasn't a flop either. A flop is a player who provides nothing. LMAOOO!! Came here to say exactly that. What a bunch of muppets those players were and those who signed the. The worst president ever. Only worse one might be Peter Lim but he’s an owner. He effectively handed over money to Liverpool for them to afford Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker. It was astonishing that the bid was accepted in the first place for Coutinho. Thank you Most people don't realize how much he fucked up our finances.   We're still suffering the effects of his tenure. The FFP restrictions come as a direct result of the money he spent on mostly needless transfers and ridiculously high wages on those players.   People don't realize that if you can't sign key quality players, your performances will suffer as a result. This is what Xavi was saying. Barcelona isn't in the same position it was 10 years ago. Oh, you need a top right winger? He's 80 million or whatever for Leão.   Right now we're struggling to register players we're signing on a free. What a time to be alive. At the time fans were hailing him for doing that and threatening him for his hesitance on raising Messi's salary. Laporta is not doing you any favors. For some reason, you have been digging the hole Barto created even deeper ever since he left. Your fans and everyone in Barcelona were happy about those transfers at that time so don't blame Bartomeu alone, yall were just blind🤷‍♂️ I mean it’s not like he was buying bad players for inflated prices?  Coutinho was the best player in the prem, Dembele was the best young talent and Griezman was one of the best strikers in the world. They turned awful playing for clueless coaches but for the most part their pricetags were justified (as much as modern transfer fees can be justified atleast) its honestly easiest to think of transfers are pre and post neymar.   there's a CLEAR divide. The thing is PSG would 100% buy him again, and Barca would 100% wish they can say no.      Quite bizarre. First it was Bale who distorted the market, then it was Neymar.   Expensive transfers that fail will always fuck up the market.   ""If he's worth 100m, how much would my player be worth"" Wow what an insight > The Neymar to PSG transfer really distorted the market.  Did it?. Only really distored Barça's window that summer because everyone knew they had over 220M in the bank, so they got rinsed in every negotiation. But after that summer everything went to ""normal"" prices.  Its been like 7 years and top transfers go for 100M-120M. Its over 100M away from what Neymar costed and quite similar of the prices of 7-10 years ago top transfers. Bellingham costed similar to Pogba or Gareth Bale.  In hindsight Neymar transfer to PSG (and Mbappe) was just an exception. Curiously, the three players were signed by the three big teams for similar amounts, ranging from 120M€ to 127M€. All three are left wingers, as Griezmann played there for most of his tenure at Barcelona since Suárez and Messi occupied his position during his two seasons there.  And also is pretty interesting that the one that did better was João since so far he has failed and it seems that there’s no way back for him at Atlético but let’s not forget that he was crucial in the league title of “La Liga de la Pandemia” (The league of the pandemic), the season 2020/2021. Meanwhile Griezmann didn’t win much, just a Copa del Rey and Hazard won but he didn’t help at all being on the bench in his last seasons and not doing much in the 2019/2020 league title where he played less than half of the league matches and participated in just 4 goals (1 goal / 3 assists). I see your Coutinho and raise you Griezmann. Atleti sold him for ~140M(Barca paid extra afterwards to avoid going to court for tapping up) leading to his wages crippling Barca and having to give us Suarez for peanuts. Then Suarez ends up being pivotal in winning us La Liga  Then on top of all that, we get Griezmann back for ~40M. So basically we got 100M and a league title for a 2 year Griez loan.  The common theme here is Bartomeu lmao A total fleece Yeah Hazard is 160 with bonuses and he reached them all Zidane would be 300-500M atp with how it was in reference to Madrids income for that season How much would 2008 ronaldo and 2012 Messi cost in today's market.  They'd easily have a 500+ mil transfer fee There was study dated from Neymar transfer to psg that showed that the %of revenue of the sum of the 10 richest clubs for Neymar transfer to psg was the same as Figo transfer to real Madrid   So the transfers went up, but so did clubs revenue, Ronaldo being from 2009 most likely won't surpass Zidane from early 2000 adjusted for inflation 94m in 2009 would be 130m today 100% If he was consistent, then he would definitely deserve the price tag. Unfortunately, he performs well only 2-3 games per season. Joao Felix is one of those players who at his best is world class but at his worse is average and he never sits in the middle it’s one of the 2. He needs to find motivation to play at his peak week in week out. He's absolutely coasting off of that price tag too. Had that transfer never happened he'd be some average player nobody really talks about but instead it brought him so much attention, FIFA trying to parade him as the next big wonder kid etc. Yeah, there was a lot going on under the hood during that transfer.  I remember ppl asking themselves why he was so much cheaper than Bale when he was clearly better *Rosell. Went to jail for misappropriation of funds but was then later fully acquitted ""somehow"" by the Spanish courts. There's a rumor that one of the bonuses included a harem of prostitutes for neymar's dad for a night before he signs the contract. I think it was like 50 for the transfer and 38mil to his dad, similar to Haaland who’s like 100mil total 40mil agent fees  Other than scoring some memorable goals Bale was not a resounding success. He played less than 50% possible minutes, not a guaranteed starter, not great in the league. Perfectly balanced. They got blessed by having Messi and a golden generation only to keep paying the price for it for decades to come. Barca DNA lol It makes our comeback from financial destitution even better Is that true? Surely a Galáctico Madrid team was more expensive, or one of the Manchester teams. I only say this because we had a lot of youth academy players who were free transfers, so it likely balanced out. Salah and Coutinho played together for half a season Don't think Liverpool would have bought all of em if Cout wasn't sold. And I also don't think Liverpool would have won this much if it was cout instead of 1/2 of those players. only top 5 rest were amazing players Griezmann was very good at barca and despite the fact of playing in a position which he has no familiarity  and still he had 50g/a assist in 100 matches for barca  while having Messi in his team which is insane I member it being 40m, the extra 48m was, well, the extra money paid by other means. Used to be the same company but split into 21st Century Fox (Movie producer, sold to Disney), Fox Sports (National brand, the regional got sold) and Fox News (The national which you are asking about but also the regionals which are different) at different times and has been sold off to different groups Yes, and it’a actually unrealated to foxes Well Lautaro costs more than €95m so that in itself isn’t an argument Tbh idk why it says 95 here for him though - it was 75 he has to hit bonuses Fixed fee is 75M, bonuses aren't added for all of the players in this graphic Only one year of contract left and we needed the money. Ofc he's worth much more than Dembélé ever was. Coutinho was brought to win the CL, which he did. In my eyes he didn't fail Wasn't that known from first day? Neymar didn’t flop at Barcelona to be fair and even bale showed up big time in important matches. Besides that I agree Lol nope Bale was far from a flop Not just successes but arguably some of the best transfers ever (jury still out on Jude).   *Insert balanced as all things should be meme* Before we get all gooey about how our team is more thrifty, let's understand the appreciation of the market.  The real market value of the bottom four (discounting Álvarez since it's just happened) in today's dollars would cost as much if not (considerably) more in today's era and would likely flip the table. And the ones who are both top 6 bottom 5 are Jude Bellingham I think what Carlo tried to say a few days ago was that it was a mentality problem aswell as the injuries. At Lille and Chelsea, he was always the first name on the XI, even when he played bad or when he didn’t train. Him being lazy at training has always been a running gag, and it’s always the first thing that everyone says about him. Unfortunately you can’t be lazy at Real and I think that was what didn’t work out for him there >Hazard’s body let him down,  I don't think it was his body. I just think he couldn't give less of a fuck tbh. Either way you spin it, Hazard soooort of always let his body down though, but his carelessness is what also made him so good He didn't take care of himself. The latter imo.   I used to watch barca games much more at that time; honestly though he clearly struggled in 2019-20, he was much better in 2020-2021 and he was instrumental for their copa win. I think if he had been a 60-80m signing with a more normal salary he'd be seen as a success, but he never lived up to his crazy price tag+ salary.   You could see the quality was there, but he moved to the one club in the world who had a better player at his main position, and neither Koeman, Setien, or Valverde thought of using him as the Iniesta replacement they so craved like Deschamps did in 2022 and instead either used him as a forward butting head with Messi (there were games where they would literally take the ball from each other because they were on the same patch of grass) or send him to the bench. He was good for Barcelona, just not 120m good. He really shouldn’t get lumped in with Dembele, Coutinho, etc. Felix if he had been signed for 40-50M would have been considered differently and he did have very good periods for Atleti. Much less of a flop than Hazard but for 127M you still have to say it was a bust Eh if you pay that much for a player and he isn’t integral in winning trophies or elevating your team to the next level, he is a flop. For that money you get 2-3 players who perform just as good, or a couple of world class talents.  The only time that’s really different is when a team is already set on every position and he just becomes an expensive completion, like graelish at city. idk how u don't consider felix a big flop too Griezmann was only really good for Barca in a couple of months during his second season. Koeman figured out a system where he and Messi thrived. but apart from that he struggled. still he was better than coutinho but not Dembele You can say that Griezmann wasnt as bad as other flops in the list, and that would be true but saying this:  > Griezmann was actually really good in Barcelona  Is actually lying and trying to rewrite history.  He scored 22 league goals in 2 seasons playing at Barça with MEssi. Thats worse numbers than Joselu right there.  > it's just him being played out of his position   Could be, but he wasnt good in that position, so why saying ""Griezmann was really good in Barcelona""?  > But him personally, he delivered  No, he didnt. Thats why he wanted to go back to Atleti ,thats why Barça wanted him out and thats why Barça fans also wanted him out. Everyone was happy with him leaving the club.  For some reason you want to talk about carrying hard Barça vs Granada in the copa del Rey but forget to talk about the Champions League and his games vs Juventus (0-3), PSG (1-4) or Bayern Munich (2-8) where he had 0 goals and 0 assists in any of the games vs top teams in the UCL while at Barça (actually he had 0 assists in the UCL while playing there).  Also 0 goals and 0 assists in all his clásicos.  What do you mean with ""he delivered""?   > he was one of the hard carriers in 20/21 season in particular when Barca won the Spanish Cup  The only top 8 team they faced in that Copa del Rey run was Sevilla in the semifinals. And he had 0 goals and 1 assist in those 2 games. What a ridiculous statement and shows how little you know.  Barto will go down as one of the greats in RM history Considering Valencia were about to be bankrupt and go into administration before Peter Lim, doesn’t it mean the foundation before him is technically the worst and he’s number 2? I mean running up a 250 million debt is Barto before Barto. And they had no levers. They fucked the club, sold it for cheap and left. that Malaga owner is worse > It was astonishing that the bid was accepted in the first place for Coutinho.  Well it wasn't, was it? Coutinho kicked up a stink and forced the transfer. We had absolutely no intention of selling him.  That's what makes the schadenfreude oh so strong. Maybe the best piece of business in the history of the sport. Youre plain wrong please do some research How? This is from last summer and our net spend was 20 mil under Laporta so far. It's 80 mil now if you count Olmo. Which is still very good for a big club like Barca that aspires to challenge for every trophy. https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/168xs9o/mundodeportivo_all_of_barcelonas_signings_and/  The total salary has gone down by 180 mil.   >you have been digging the hole Barto created even deeper ever since he left.  So yes this statement is rather confusing. Happy or not, they didn’t make the decisions. Fans also get blinded by the name arriving. As an outsider, Barto is to blame. If you could find one person being happy about buy Griezmann after he rejected us the year before and 135M for Dembele, I’ll be quite happy.   You’re 100% right on Coutinho. Should a president be held to the same standard as reactionary fans?   Also Coutinho and Griezmann weren’t favourable. Most fans weren’t optimistic about how they’d fit In what world was coutinho the best in the prem? He was a streaky player that went through bouts of being excellent but even then he wasn't even top 5. Dembele had publicised attitude issues before he moved and everyone knew griezman didn't fit into Barca style of play except Barca. Griezman's price was justified but Dembele and coutinho were huge overpay and everyone knew it at the time. > I mean it’s not like he was buying bad players for inflated prices?  They weren't bad players, but it was crazy money to pay for players Barca didn't have a very clear plan for. And three of them… Pre and Post Arab oil > The thing is PSG would 100% buy him again  Of course, it's the only reason the club is relevant. No meaningful silverware to show for the Neymar/Mbappe transfers but it brought so much exposure to the club as a brand and a business. It's insane the numbers that their stadium tour put out, even on a rainy day with school on they'll still get hundreds in attendance. Given a second chance neymar would probably insist on staying Bale did not distort the market. From 2009 (Ronaldo) to 2013 (Bale) the record went from £80m to £86m then was broken by United in 2016 (Pogba) for £89m. That's a completely normal rise (£9m in 7 years) and in no way a ""distortion"".   We then went from £89m in 2016 to fucking £198m in 2017 with Neymar to PSG. *That* is what distorted the market. In a single year the record transfer was £109m above the previous holder. The difference between first and second was bigger than the fucking previous record holder.  Also you can't seriously be calling Bale a failure, he scored two cup winners in Copa and La Decima, then went on to help contribute for major silverware including a bicycle kick in a CL final. It distorted the market in a way that made other transfers that were ‘only’ between 70-100 million insignificant. I mean another common theme is these are undoubtedly good players. Who have shown how talented they are. At the time it was a steep price but nobody thought either would flop. Bro you guys are increasing this every year and he already left😭 He did not reach them all at all.  He failed at all of his individual ones, the only ones he achieved were the collective ones.  Number of Appearances, Goals, Ballon d'or etc Its really weird bonuses are added for Alvarez but not for Bellingham or Hazard This get's higher every time, lol  It's impossible that Hazard reached any individual bonus. He reached team performance bonus. Real Madrid always adds bonus for Balon d'or and similar stuff Fee relative to income is a really interesting way of looking at this.  It’s certainly more revealing than a straight up inflation adjustment.   I think I recall seeing that Manchester United’s most expensive ever signing was Bryan Robson because they basically spent two thirds of all the money they had on him.  He was worth it though. Zidane was 77,5m, which was 56% of Real Madrid's income that year (138m iirc) Figo was even more then. around 560mil Sir Alex was furious that Ronaldo only went for 80m, he wanted a LOT more, and for good reason Prospect in Brazil vs proven talent in Europe narrowed it a bit maybe? He was already playing well for Brazil though. Wasn’t this where the orgy story comes from? Considering how some of those memorable goals won us multiple trophies on its own including UCLs , I would say it was a resounding success ragebait 🤡 Good one, kiddo Worst take on r/soccer, possibly.ever. Nah Barcelona's 2018-19 and 19-20 squads had the highest wage bill in history of football.  Really interesting how they keep pushing the underdog angle. You’re completely right lol it was Alisson money lol I keep forgetting we only bought salah for 40 mil Did he sign a contract extension? I know that’s the price Arsenal was looking to offer last year, but I thought his contract was up in 2026, without an extension I’d be surprised if he fetched that level of a fee coutinho was bought to win ucl, which he won with bayern not with barca. May be. I only remember that was tried to be avoided for whatever reason Jude jury still out??? That season was worth the transfer in every sense. Maybe he hasn't done enough yet but yours easily be able to flip him for 160m and make a huge profit so it's kind of objectively a good transfer right now Bake one of the best signings ever? Give me a break.  I can name 100 better if you gave me a pen and paper. ""some of the best transfers ever"" is a bit much for Bale. Very good transfer, but not that. He was also the most expensive player ever back then let's face it was Bale truly one of the best transfers ever? he had some historic moments but I feel like he had so many bad times at Real too and many injuries I mean, Vini went above him and at that time, Vini wasn't a polished player like now. [deleted] A pity that such a good football player’s answer to his favorite dish was hamburgers. But it kinda defined Hazard.  He’s pretty good on his bike nowadays. > He was good for Barcelona, just not 120m good.  Well, yeah, if you remove the price tag then all of the sudden the transfers arent that bad.   If Barça had paid 80M instead of 120M, he would still be considered a flop. He is a big flop, but there are levels to this. He still contributed a lot to Atleti winning La Liga and was much better than the likes of Hazard Hail Barto Will always get a warm welcome in Liverpool as well. Deportivo never recovered and went to 3rd league from LaLiga winners Dortmund and Liverpool spent the Neymar money very wisely. Okay, but what have you done with the money you got except splurging it on short sighted signings? Good luck trying to get rid of the top earners. Fans morale and the media plays a huge factor espeacially in a fan owned club like Barcelona, and they decided that those transfers were fine and fully supported the management which resulted in more similar transfers, just like how they removed Bartomeu from his seat when everything gone wrong they decided that those transfers were right at that time, so again, they are to blame WITH Bartomeu, the main one to blame ofc.  And where in my comment did I say Barto is not to blame? Now you guys just wanna make it seem like I said something wrong by twisting it, cuz you don't wanna blame the whole club and fans and wanna ignore everything and keep on saying ""Fuck Bartomeu"" like this whole thing wasn't everyone's mistake too and wanna show the whole football world ""Poor Barcelona the big football club that suffered got destroyed by an individual bad president"".  And thats the truth yall hate to hear. I don't remember the reactions about Griezmann.  But the fans were 1000% happy about Coutinho and dembele No but the whole club should be blamed for supporting that President no? You guys wanted this In 17/18 when he left Coutinho had more G/A than games played and was the best player in . People forget that for 6 months Liverpool had Mane, Firmino and Salah but Courinho ran the show. If he didnt leave he was well on track to win POTY.  Also considering the fact that you bought him in the middle of a title challenge instead of the summer kacked up his price Pre and Post Roman's Chelsea The Ibrahimovic PSG era was popular too… PL Tv rights distorted the markets actually  You need to have money to buy players, there’s only one league in the world where the 15th club can spend 150M and get relegated  Neymar was worth 200M at the time Random overrated Englishman going for 50M wasn’t Ronaldo was the record buy before that and nobody could ever argue that Ronaldo was overpaid or a bad deal. He was just exceptionally good.  Now the Bale deal might just be a little more expensive than Ronaldo was, but the expectations were the same. Turned out that Bale was nowhere near the player Ronaldo was, and let's be real, he didn't perform like a 90m player at that time.   He shouldn't be classified as a failure, but in my opinion he also shouldn't be classified as a succes. He was the most expensive transfer in the world and just didn't meet the expectations. He stepped up in important moments such as the CL final goals, and that makes up for a lot of that fee, but if you remember how hyped all the real fans were when he joined, then he definitly was not a succes.   Hence people afterwards started comparing their players to a good performing Bale. Before nobody was able to argue that their player was worht 100m, because you would be comparing them to Ronaldo. When Bale went for more then that, everybody started comparing their players to Bale and asking for the same money.   So yes, Bale definitly distorted the market. Neymar's deal fucked it up even more, but Bale's deal moved a lot of goalposts. How? It's been 7 years and today paying 80M or 90M for a player is not insignificant. Agreed, although Coutinho was always an overpay. Griezmann was worth that money but he didn't fit Barca I thought it reached 160 million euros with the final add ons? Or was it 145? Either way it was a massive amount that was more than the number on this list Its ok.  Just think you got hazard,Rudiger and courtios from Chelsea for a combined 180M. My bad, I assumed that since he reached the 160 million euro mark that the add ons were all reached - at least it was phrased that way when another add on was triggered this year I think Ok, maybe not all of the adds on were reached but I thought it was reported earlier this year that the outlay reached 160 million euros? Or maybe it was 145 and misremembering. As I said above, the fee you paid ended up being higher than the one listed here. Plus you rinsed us for Courtois so can pretend the add ons were for him lol crazy stuff lol. Even in this market almost 80m is a lot of money for a player so it would be about 600m considering they had 1.1bn in revenue this year Wasn’t Ronaldo himself pushing for it by saying Real Madrid is his dream team? Not much you can do as a manager if your own employee wants to leave. Who the fuck said anything about being an underdog? I thought you were talking about transfer fees, not wages. That’s quite clear with what I said in my comment. Alisson and Fabinho money He’s said to have extended with a new wage of €9m net, just hasn’t been announced yet. Yes, that's why I wrote that he won it 😅 Nothing indicates that Jude won't be a success but 1 season alone is. It e ough to justify €100?. For example, if Jude never plays again, can we call it €100m well spent? Yeah if he pulls a Hazard after that season I don't think it can be seen as a success. He’s not the most expensive if you account for inflation. And he was a key part of the most successful run in champions league history. So I’d say he was well worth the money and arguably one of the best transfers ever.  Yes. We paid 100M for him and he was an integral in numerous trophy runs. He missed a lot of time but outside of the back end of his prime when he was falling apart physically, he always delivered People who call Bale a flop probably compare him to Ronaldo  He had so many iconic moments for Madrid, was integral part of the 3peat team and was a beast when injury free not one of the best transfers ever but a top top player who was more than worth his high fee He was consistently a top 5 winger in the world for multiple years, and he achieved that in an era with Messi, Cristiano and Neymar all in their peaks.  If that's not a good transfer I don't know what is. If Antony generated half as much value to Man U as bale did for Madrid Ten Hag would be called a genius. Bales stats are great, he was a key part of madrids success and the 3-peat, and had some iconic goals including the CdR classico and his bicycle goal in the CLfinal.  He is absolutely a RM legend and one of the best signings in club history. It wasn't until Bale that Madrid went back to winning ways in the Champions League This is such a crazy take, but I respect putting it out there to be a lightning rod for downvotes. Huh? Bale single-handedly won them the copa against Barcelona and scored in the final for the champions league. He was well worth it for them He was worth the sum for the goal vs Liverpool alone. Still upset Zizu started Eden over Vini in the covid CL matchup against city It doesnt take much to go above an injured playet > I don't doubt there are some guys over the years in football that are the same way.  Footballers didn't use to have to run like maniacs, and it was common for footballers to be out on the piss every night until fairly recently. In the '90s, you'd probably still have an alcoholic or two in your side. Barto was bad for Real too. A bad Barca is bad for the league Only Gundo and Lewandowski were the major ones that were older players. Gundo was a free transfer. Alonso and Romeu were cheap serviceable options. Most of the other signings range from early to mid 20s.   Frenkie's contract expires in 2026 and Lewandowski has one more year left. Ansu is the only young player that is on higher wages than what he deserves. The rest of the squad besides those three have reasonable wages for what they bring to the team. Umm have you seen our team?  When laporta took over, we had a frontline of Depay, Luuk and Trincao/Yusuf Demi. Midfield substitutes were Puig and Pjanic. Dest at RB, Firpo at LB and Garcia was the third choice CB.   We know have Ferran, Lewy, Raphinha, Gundogan, Kounde, Christensen. Players who are astronomically clear of who they were replacing.   And all of this was done at 20 million net spend. I challenge anyone else to do this. Ok Liverpool fan, are you? He was Liverpool's best player at that time, no doubt,' and was one of the best players in the league, but in no way, shape, or form was he the very best player and only Liverpool fans believed him to be so. That's just not true. He wasn't even Liverpools best player in that time. I've no idea who you is here but he definitely had a hot streak What you're saying is the equivalent of saying that Jamie vardy was the best player in the league during his hot streak but you're mistaking form for best. In no world was coutinho ever called the best player in the league. Pre and Post Florentino’s Galacticos pre and post boehly Just completely ignoring country/ oil or american billionaire owners? Your club don't need to make money to buy players, since random sponsorships can just be made up.  TV rights might have made English players heavily overpriced, but at least now every non-english club is able to sell their players for 3x the worth to an english club, so at least it trickles back in the market. On top of that, TV rights sale is actual market working. The PL generated an absurd amount of viewership, and thus it became more interesting for sponsors. Remind me of players like Anthony or Pepe’s pricetag and contribution again Put that Griezmann into this Barca and it's perfect. Things just don't line up sometimes. Everyone forgets now how good coutinho was for Liverpool, I was devastated when he left, even with the amount it cost. Barca completely misused him, trying to force him to be the new iniesta, then when that failed they tried to make him the new neymar.   In that market at that time, it was a bit of an overpay, but people forget how good he was for Liverpool because of how badly the transfer went and how well Liverpool did after he left If Messi wasn’t at Barca still, griezman would have been a perfect fit but that didn’t happen I think we paid you 20-30 mil alone from his massive impact on Madrid's UCL win Yeah, it was more than it listed here for sure. It was a disaster transfer for a lot of reasons but the club recovered greatly, we won 2 UCL since then and in part thanks to the hazard failure Vini developed as a proper balon d'or (maybe if Hazard didn't get injured we could have won more, we will never know :D)  Anyway, about the list, I don't know why they add the bonuses on Julian and not in the others, that's wrong It is a lot, that's the level of the most expensive defender and carries a huge weight Iirc he was already set to leave a year prior but got convinced to just stay on for one more year and then he would be set free - which he was and the rest is history [deleted] Considering that he helped them win a UCL and league title, yes? Every club would be willing to spend 100 million on a player if he helps them win a UCL title. If Kane had won the league+UCL double in his first season and ducked back out to England, he'd be considered a success. In fact, winning one UCL title at Bayern is probably the ceiling of his possible achievements. Whatever happens he has surpassed everyone on that list bar Neymar and Ronaldo. I think another star on their crest is enough for them and their fans in that situation. They’ve burned worse money than that The shirt sales already made up for the fee plus salary id imagine He was a bench player for Zidane and never reached his potential Never disappeared in UCL finals as well and he was a massive reason we finally won La Decima if he never played again after the iconic goal against barca and La Decima I'd say he was worth the transfer fee yet alone everything else he achieved with us. TBF, without taking any sides, they didn't call him a flop. They simply argued if he was indeed *one of the best transfers ever?* I think he should be, but even just for Madrid, he certainly wouldn't be in the top 3.  Now if the question was if Bale was a great signing, the opinion would be unanimous, I imagine. Nobody is arguing against it being a good transfer. Just that’s it’s not one of the best all time transfers. I don't need to say how underrated Bale is but one of the best transfers of all time is a bit much, I think you'd have to factor in the price in that. Imo it would be someone like Kante who was signed for peanuts and became world class There is a massive leap from well worth it to one of the best transfers of all time. For Bale to even be considered that, at that price I would at least demand Ronaldo numbers. And played vini essentially as a rwb. Not saying Real would have won if vini was there but might have been better cause vini started to slowly show improvement by that time. I think Hazard also commented on this, he never put any effort into training until he got to Real where he did try hard and then immediately got injured because his body couldn't handle it. Yeaaa they don’t give a fuck Madrid fan wise he literally handicapped Messi season after season, it was like a how-to in wasting all that Neymar sale money and then some. I don't know why you are getting downvoted. As a Madrid fan I've always said that Real Madrid needs a strong Barcelona and vice versa. Its good for the league and its good for us to the best version of ourselves in Europe. ( I said Europe and not UCL, because you guys might have liked the taste of Europa League :P :P) Ferran? You can’t be serious. 50m for him? Same goes for bringing in aging players like Lewandowski and paying them huge wages. And now, Olmo, an injury prone player, for 60m + addons? How is pulling levers left and right by selling the future only to buy players on a whim any better? Sure he improved the books now, but how can you tell you’ll stay in the position when all you end up with are players on high wages who are not even playing much/well and don’t want to leave? Ok maybe someone else can prove me wrong ig Lmao just go look at any liverpool match thread or player rating from that time since you clearly didnt watch liverpool. Hell even the season before he was WhoScored highest rated player in the entire league Nah there is a difference.   Real's spent big on few very specific players that were deemed to be a galactico, while saving money on other parts of the squad. So Beckham was a galactico but Scholes wasnt one. And Real had big holes in their defense during the Galacticos era cause they didnt spend big there.   Chelsea was the first in the world to try and fill their whole squad with world class players bought from anywhere. They would target the players their rivals were going for or even buy some from their rivals (like Cole) resulting in raised prices for everyone in the league. Chelsea's aim was to price out the league and Arab oil money has since copied that. Can I remind you of Haalands pricetag and contribution? > Everyone forgets now how good coutinho was for Liverpool, I was devastated when he left, even with the amount it cost.  Obviously the success worked out for the club in the end but I'm so curious what Liverpool under Klopp would have looked like if Coutinho stayed. As you said he really was good, but would the club have been able to back that up with players on that level or would he always be the standout? I haven't forgotten. It was still an overpay To be honest I think Odegaard has been a bit better but I don't think Arsenal would sell him right now for anything less than £130 , at least at face value.  That was still an absurd amount of money for Coutinho but I can kinda see why Barca did it. yes but most clubs aren’t real madrid who farm the european cup and would likely win it anyway Then why do they hate Bale.  I think that the hate for him is wrong but he got a lot of flak. they would’ve spend the 100 million on someone else, and likely we would’ve won it still Plus, even if he loses his left leg, you can still sell him to Saudis for 200m now. They would’ve won it regardless lol the whole season everyone talked about how badly Madrid needed a striker and fullbacks and even a keeper with cortoius gone most of the year and they still won almost everything and Bale He is not near Bale yet Had he not played alongside, arguably, Madrid's best player ever, people wouldn't even flinch to say that he was well worth the 100M and great transfer overall. [deleted] *At least* Ronaldo numbers? What? How is that a reasonable threshold lol Eden that game was literally like playing with 10 men Imagine being a professional athlete and your body breaks down because you actually have to train lmao Which is a real shame. I wish he'd have stayed at Chelsea from a selfish point of view because he's the best player I've watched live and on top of that, he was so entertaining. I found when he left I would still watch the games but it was far less enjoyment and much more nervy. I agree about needing Barca to be good for the good of la liga, but as far as UCL reals been the most dominant side in the competitions history over the last decade so I don't think you can really say that Barcas relevance is much of a factor.  Overall I agree though,  a good Barca is good for Madrid Ferran although was a bit of an overpay helped us finish 2nd that season (we were 5th in January before he and Auba came) and took us to the CL.   Lewandowski has like 78 G/A in 96 games and won us a league title and a super cup.  I don’t see why they’re bad signings given the what they’ve done at Barcelona. Investing in younger players is always better yes, but with Barcelona’s financial situation we weren’t exactly spoiled for the likes of the Mbappes or Halaands of the world.   We have a great crop of talented youngsters and we signed really good experienced players and it worked out well for us.  Also all the money we got from the levers was invested in solving the debts because like the previous comment said, our net spend is 55 million with Olmo included since Laporta took over. None of the lever money was used for this. I have no idea of what agenda you have but you've rewritten history here. Everybody was shocked by how much Liverpool got for him. He was always an inconsistent player and didn't even start all the period you've mentioned. It's so weird to see people rewrite what actually happened to make it ook like Barca didn't massively overpay for a player that everyone thought was good but inconsistent. Players like Haaland, Bellingham etc are exceptions that were worth the price. Now you have players going for 70+ million without properly proving themselves and inevitably flopping, and it no one batting an eye. The fact that the whole of this top 5 flopped says enough. And this is without bringing some prem transfers into the equation Probably not, we signed 2 guys who became the the best cb and the best keeper in the world for a time, as good as he was coutinho wasn’t a match for that.   I just don’t want people to forget there was actually a reason Barca paid insane money for him. Mate this was 7 years ago, there’s literally no point in comparing fees. Also remember that coutinho was faking injury to attempt to force a move and giving interviews about trying to leave etc I'm sorry this just isn't true I'm definitely biased but coutinho was incredible for that first half a season felt like he was scoring a banger every other week.  Not saying odegaard isn't very very good and can be better but he is also playing for a much better team with much better players around him And Neymar  Edit: apparently Jude winning the league and champions league is already a more successful transfer than Neymar even though Neymar won the treble with Barca scoring 39 goals on route. Certainly not Vini and the rest 3 would fare much better with passage of time. Di Stefano is number 1 and Cristiano number 2 and they are light years ahead of the following pack. Then they are followed by a bevy of legends across eras, vying for the next spots like Gento, Hierro etc. etc. Bale would really struggle to break in. As a matter of fact, even someone like Modric will have to fight. He has had impact moments like Bale but he has not been limited to them in the way Bale was. People obviously remember the insane goals he produced against Liverpool in Kyiv but they forget that they were his first knockout goals in 3 years. Bale's time with us was very mercurial but I think he has done enough to secure a place in the pantheon of legends. But, at Madrid, the bar is so high that he would rather be at the back of said pantheon. My point is that when you pay a world transfer record, being one of the best signings of all time is pretty much impossible. Arguably 9. Varane had one of his worst nights in a Madrid shirt. Insane talent but not the body to keep up with that. It's not that strange in football since you can have great technique, vision and understanding of the game without also having the explosiveness, power and endurance. Or the other way round, there's plenty players who can beast it physically but don't really have refined technique or are prone to clumsy mistakes or running themselves into trouble.  Daley Blind to a lesser extend has the same trouble, his technique and vision are amazing but he's too slow and weak physically. You could say that the backbone for our success in the UCL the La Decima and the team that won the 3peat assembled while Barca was very strong. Without some players but a lot of players still played a big role in 2022 and last year. The players had to be always on 110% competing and always be on alert in La Liga which contributed for their success in my opinion in the UCL.    It's something like the Messi and Ronaldo era in La Liga, both legendary players but they pushed each other like crazy. I don't know if you watched La Liga during their era but it was like this - One scores hattrick, the next match the other one scores 4, it was something crazy.    Im talking about that extra push, extra effort that helped us a lot in the UCL to players on the field or on the transfer market >he didnt start all the period you’ve mentioned  Alright well no point in arguing with someone who just straight up doesnt know what they’re talking about lmfao. He didnt play at the start because of him trying to push a move but after that he missed 2 of 17 games before his transfer, and was liverpools best player in that period >  The fact that the whole of this top 5 flopped says enough.  3 of them were Barça's flops because everyone knew they had the Neymar money. Without those 222M from Neymar, Barça would have never paid those amounts of money for those players.  The exception was Neymar's price, not Bellinghams.  Where are the 150M flops of recent years? None, because there are no 150M signings which is my point.  If Neymar introduced such an insane inflation that lasts today, where are the 150M or 180M transfers? I watched them during that time, and I mostly agree with you.  I was just having fun reveling in the fact that Barca disappeared from UCL while Madrid continues to dominate."

Plenty of teams with good to great windows, but don't think any team quite nailed what they needed altogether, save for Villarreal maybe.  Real Sociedad and Girona did pretty good business despite plenty of key players leaving. Atletico almost had it together, then bottled it at the end...  Some truly terrible windows like Sevilla and Rayo Great work op! Who was the best and who had the worst window Ocampos left Sevilla yesterday so I'm not sure if it should be counted or not in this post. Barca’s biggest transfer happens from la masia to main team Sevilla and Rayo for worst, Villarreal and Atletico for best No Espanyol? Thought there window was one of the worst Veliz, Romero, and Kral are great loans at least"

They'll be so relieved to finally get some quality in their attack. One year late dude. Shouldn’t have signed that 5 year contract last year then…  He’s firmly in the Bernardo zone IMO. Everyone that would want him can’t afford him and everyone who can afford him (and we’d sell to) is sorted at striker.  Atletico are his only hope and they haven’t dropped the £70m+ it would take on someone for a few years now. I know an alternative Julian Alvarez on recent transfer rumours: “These are things that are said, but I am calm; I am comfortable and happy at #ManCity; we will see what happens…” [@Fichajes_futbolvia @Sport_Witness] The only time Madrid signing Julian Alvarez made sense was directly out of River Plate. Once he chose to go to City and Madrid didn’t push further, any chances of him going to Madrid died. Shame, because it could have been a great match considering Madrid’s lack of a striker to backup and later fill in for Benzema. That said, the club no longer has that issue.  I thought he wanted playtime. Good luck getting any minutes with Mbappe in front of you Please stop, we can't have 40 players on the bench Lol good luck with that lad Hed end up in the same situation, as a second striker playing competing with Mbappe, Joselu and Endrick. I would love to have him but it wouldn't make sense, Madrid is the one club with even bigger competition for his position than Man City. We have Mbappé, who is in his prime, and Endrick, who is younger than him. Not to mention Joselu of course. I love that now that Barca is known to be bankrupt, players are outright just saying they want to go to Madrid.  That said, how front heavy is Madrid going to be exactly? They already have Mbappe, Vini and Rodrygo. How is Alvarez going to get more playtime there versus City? Buddy you think you don’t get minutes NOW? We are here for you Julian This is reddit headline is a bit misleading. The headline says [The Athletic] but links to a clickbaity fan site called 'manchestercity.news'. There *is* a secondary link to The Athletic, but the actual quote is this:  >The Argentinian has been open to a move for several months, although his first-choice destination — Real Madrid — is not going to happen this summer, at least. He is thought to want more first-team football.  The subtleties of language make the meaning fairly different to me. There's no space at RM. Mbappe and Endrick will compete for that position. I think the best option for him is Arsenal. Can be the missing piece of puzzle in Arsenal's attack. But, I don't know if City sells him to their biggest rivals or if Arsenal can afford him. I think he's one year late in forcing this move. Could have joined United last year before Hojlund. I too am unhappy with my employer and would love to play for Real Madrid Real Madrid?  Sorry chief, best I can do is Rayo Vallecano. I too would love to play for Real Madrid and unlike Julian here am for sale for the low low price of 0 euro I too would love to play for Real Madrid, I have my Madrid kit ready to go What if you wanted Real Madrid, but actually you want to play for Atletico?👉👈 I also want to play for RM. Please contact me as soon as possible. So he can play even less minutes than he does currently? Interesting. He’s get even less time there… what the fuck So basically he wants to leave man city bench and sit on RMA bench... Move from one club’s bench to another’s? Come on bro. Goddamn Julian, couldn't you have decided that last year? it pains me because he is basically what we actually needed lmao a skilled striker that could play centrally and had good asociative play, fuck. Madrid is kind of stacked mate, come to united. You would fight to qualify for EL but you'll be a starter Argentines really don't like to live in Manchester Even if RM unloads and cash in on Rodrygo, there is no space. Unless this upcoming year causes some drama and make someone else consider leaving. He should go to Saudi Arabia for big money, after having won everything at age 24 This is getting ridiculous, there is ZERO room on the offensive half. shit man, me too. I'd love to play for Real! I mean, I can see why he’d be dissatisfied. He did great covering for both Haaland and KDB, and having a guy who can cover two important roles like that is great, but for a player it probably feels like playing second fiddle.  That said, if Madrid wanted him, he’d be playing fifth fiddle, easily. At this point, is there a single team on the planet more spoiled for choice in building an offense? Before Mbappe, I might have said Man City, but with Bernardo Silva and KDB signaling their exit, Real is the kid with all the expensive toys.  Frustrating as it might be, it would be smarter to wait. His contract’s not up, if memory serves, and if de Bruyne makes good on all his hinting, Alvarez can find himself in that regular starting position he wants. ... he wants to go to the only other club where he won't get minutes? and I want Dua Lipa I expect a lot of the fraud clubs best players will be leaving in the near future. He would be a great fit for Chelsea IMO, they really need a striker and that's Julian's best position. I don't think City Group would like to sell to Premier League clubs though. I'd swear I read he was a Barca fan 1 year ago... Yeah same man Mikel drooling at the thought of another City Striker come join Everton Thats why he signed a new contract a few months ago extending for another year 👍 I've been thinking about leaving my job to play for Real Madrid as well. I wonder if Madrid’s bench is more comfortable than city’s. Galacticos 3: electric boogaloo  Sell Tchouaméni and Valverde. Make it interesting for the rest of us He is worries about being second in line at MC, but wants to be 4th in line at RM.   Genius. Frome one bench to another bench If barca had money he would be perfect for them. He’s not going anywhere. Not sure why this is being reported. City will let players go if they want to leave the club for the right price - no club will match the £85M that City would want for him. He’s a valuable part of the squad - look at the impact he had when Haaland and KDB went down last season. Obviously he’s good enough to start at the 9 every match for a top club but he signed a 5 year contract last year and is valued by MCI. It is what it is. BREAKING NEWS: every player wants to play for Real Madrid And I want to leave my wife for Sydney Sweeney He can sit behind Rodrygo on the bench, playing less than Arda Guler Good thing he's 100% not needed there The Athletic is getting really bad with their transfer writing in particular. On par with ESPNFC . ...Do we need to impose a cap on how many players can go to Madrid? Because this is getting ridiculous. Lmao the guy needs a reality check Going from one bench to another, huh, interesting strategy Huh?? Wasn’t he the one to complain about playing time and wants Madrid? so do I Julian but there's no room in the squad in city he still rotational player, did he confident that he will be play more in madrid? Come back home Alvarez Makes zero sense for him and the club. Need to focus on defenders Pick Bayern instead These rumours are all based on his lack of playtime being the biggest factor in a transfer. Surely he has a much higher chance of getting playtime at city than Madrid. Come to Barca , please . Why the hell RMA need him now ? At least he’s guaranteed a starting place at Barca within a year as Lewandoski will leave soon Why would he go to the club where he will be on bench if hes looking for minutes? Doesnt make sense really I doubt City would ever sell to us again and definitely not for a reasonable fee but come to Arsenal Would love to have him at Spurs. Tbh could easily happen if not for Daniel Levy. Quite like him as a player so wish him all the best. He shouldn’t be playing second fiddle to anyone. He’s a very good player and would have been useful last season but now we have Mbappe lol I too would like to leave my current place of employment and sign for Real Madrid So playtime isn’t even the issue Sell Rodrygo, buy Alvarez. Solved. Same. I would love a vacation home in Madeira and a big house in the country but it doesn't mean I'm going to get it. He should set his eyes on lesser clubs Chelsea or Man Utd maybe. >he would love to play for Real Madrid  The author of that Pep Barca conspiracy pasta crying in the club right now. Lol he isn't going to RMA Can we sign to play in matches that are on odd dates I would too. But... HA! Been telling my mates at uni that RMA or Atletico should be looking at Julian Alvarez and they weren’t really going for it 😭 RMA fans are the most spoiled fans itw I u seated him wanting to leave, cause I figured he wanted more minutes, but goin to real makes zero sense. They have some many forwards, he not playing there regularly either. Also all the best players wanting to go to Madrid is getting a little old Lmao Madrid I’d love to play there too, could see him going to Barca though He should signed last year and could be the Real Madrid  #9. Trade one bench for another? He means to sit on the bench at RMA home matches At City, he had realistic chances to start 15-25 games and play another 20 a rotation to KdB and Haaland.   At Madrid? It would be a dogfight to get playing time. I’m not saying he can’t as he is very talented, but Mbappe and Vini are durable, Rodrigo and Endrick who are not guaranteed starters as is can compete with his minutes. So he can be a sub for Mbappe. I too am extraordinarily humble In where he would play in RM, he would be more fringe player than current team he is in Wow how exciting, why do the 16/17 other teams in La Liga even bother to show up Dude should of stayed in la fabrica when he tried out. Get in line, homeboy. he cant get gametime in City and he thinks he'll get it in much more stacked up front Madrid? Everyone twerking for madrid now that they up. We need a Rw, but it is an overkill From being a bench warmer to another. Nice! I totally get why he wants more playtime. But why the fuck would he ever think he'd get it here? Would be comparable to what he is already doing. Sounds like bullshit to me. Real Madrid is going to have 2,000 players on their roster at this point Uh oh Messi would like a word for his fellow argentine Liverpool should go for him, it would be nice to have a forward who can actually finish! Swap with Rodrygo? Who says no? Mbappe can play left and Julian as ST. And city can use Rodrygo with Haaland more effectively than Haaland and Julian? He has no place there. Isn’t he a top barca target? Bro struggles to get in a front three consisting of Foden, Doku and Haaland but thinks he’ll break into one consisting of Vini, Mbappe and Endrick/Rodrygo. He ain’t playing 10 either because Jude is there lmao. I don't think with Madrid's line up, he's gonna play more minutes than in City. Come to Barca baby! Tired of sitting on the bench in Manchester he wants to do it in Madrid. Don't blame him tbh He would start at most PL clubs, but city has Haaland. Realistically, does he reallys tart at RMA either? Also, city wont let a promising young attacker go cheap. I say he goes on loan to Leicster, West Ham, Brighton, Brentford, Sevilla, or Sociedad. Where he’ll be overshadowed by Mbappe now instead of Haaland lol Could go Liverpool, United, or Spurs. Absolutely delusional. Ti's the season!   What a sensible career move that would be if he's sick of riding the bench!? Sorry Julian the spot is reserved for Mighty Joselu and his super sub Mbappe. Try Chelsea they have an opening in their 50-player bill. He is going to Italy,  Inter Milan . Easy He's not getting much minutes because of Haaland and he wants to go to a team that has Mbappe and Vinicius. Doesn't make sense at all. PSG would be ideal for him after the void set by Mbappe's departure. Can he play RB tho 👀 Que vuelva a River por favor He might want to try Barça instead He had fifth most minutes in the league last season and about tenth in all competitions. It must be about Haaland being the undisputed number 1 when fit. Though I do think the two could play together more often as De Bruyne has fewer and fewer minutes. People say he has a better all-around game than Haaland but I can’t agree. He’s not a great presser or dribbler, the ball bounces off of him more than anyone, and he can’t win a 50/50 ball. That being said he’s an unreal finisher and pretty good poacher. Very similar profile to haaland. Lovely striker and would be great at any club. I think Barcelona needs him more, and they’ll have a spot for him too. I also would love to play for Real Madrid Wouldn’t we all mate. I would also love to play for Real Madrid Why not come to a place that grew the most famous of Argentinians hmmmm? He should really go a step down and be a star for an atlético or Liverpool Doesn't matter to what club, but I've been wishing him to leave for a long time. Not only that, he needs to play every match, and most importantly, he needs to play his older position, like when he was at River. The Alvarez who played the WC was peak, and Guardiola destroyed that player, just because he wanted to have a ""better for the team"" and let haaland shine.  So, as I said, no matter where, please leave and be a regular and true 9. Imagine going to an Atletico Madrid with Gallardo, you had the potential. I'm going to be the minority here but, I strongly believe in Julian Alvarez. In fact, I like how we play with him upfront instead of Haaland. I genuinely want the kid to get more game time and I'd totally understand if he wants to move to be able to play and develop his game more. Having said that, I don't think with Mbappe coming he'd get more game time at Real Madrid. Maybe even less because (if backstage reports are to be believed) Mbappe's ego is astronomical. No disrespect here to any one (Haaland or Mbappe). Can't blame him.  He must be tired of playing less and out of position. He’s gonna get benched and his career will be ruined like Hazard’s, he should go to Chelsea instead Yawn…I understand most people have hopes and dreams but I simply can’t understand why every Hispanic/Latino player and even some Europeans believe theirs is Real Madrid.  You become someone else who also won 1 of the 15+ CL titles or 70+ domestic titles there…wow… I’ll put $90 aside to buy the jersey of whichever club he goes Come to barca habibi, you only have to compete with a washed lewy instead of prime mbop. He wouldn’t play at Real Madrid. City are idiots if they sell him to another PL club. They made the same mistake with Palmer and it cost them 4 points last season and could’ve cost them the title as well We dont need Alvarez, better to go at Chelsea Didn't Julian just come forward stating that he doesn't want to leave? City falling apart nobody really wants to stay there for any long years, everyone wants out, this is what will determine their level in the long-run Yeah, he's complaining about playing time only to go to the 1 club in the world where the problem would be worse. Could be a contract bargaing chip or just to let Pep know he wants more playing time. He wants to leave shitty n go to a club with history that’s all. Tbh City's attack lineup is extremely thin. It's just that Pep rarely rotate that and would prefer midfielders to play on the wing than Alvarez. And well, Haaland normal wouldnt get tired unless he's injured, as he barely does anything beside scoring. He is going to PSG or Atlético. Is it really though? It’s Real Madrid. “I would like to play more but if I can get to the greatest club in the world I’ll happily make some concessions” is a perfectly reasonable take. 😔RM didn't win the Copa del Ray this season, they desperately need better quality players Still laughing at seeing a Madrid fan on here the other day suggesting they couldn't compete with the PL on signings, trying to make themselves out as underdogs.   Yeah, the biggest club on Earth with the 2nd highest wage bill is definitely struggling for signings. I for one am a little relieved. It’s been a whole eight days since they signed one of the best players in the world, and it was a bit worrying that they haven’t been able to do more to strengthen a roster that has so little talent on it. Maybe one day we'll see them in a champions league final. A boy can dream. Yes. Would have loved to see him and he suited Real.  But no way Real is gonna go for him with Mbappe in the squad unless he is a favourite of Perez. On the other hand, had he waited one more year at River for Madrid to have non-EU spots available, he could have had a shot with them the madrid sub was so horny for him last summer this kind of quote would have absolutely sent us Milan/Inter about to slide in and drop that loan with option to buy deal How much would he cost. Spurs should go for him. Chelsea can afford him and we allegedly want him.  Would absolutely give you £75m for him. It's totally a great way to invest for Atletico if they can sign someone as good as Julian Alvarez. They're not gonna get as good players often. Their only really good player is 33 years old... They could use someone real good upfront to increase chances of maintaining their position in Spain and Europe. Alvarez could also enjoy a big big role of the main goalscorer that he wants.  The sources seem to suggest that he would like some bigger club though. Chelsea possibly? He’s probably the best option they could get if City were willing to sell to them like they did with Sterling. He’s better than Ramos and RKM as well but I doubt PSG spend big on another striker. Him at Napoli under Conte would be fun as well if they get Osimhen money, but they aren’t in European competition so he might not want to go there Eh Bernardo never left because he was open about only leaving if he could play in Spain. If Alvarez is open to moving elsewhere there could definitely be suitors. I also think City would consider selling him to another Prem club for the right price, whereas they wouldn’t do that with Bernardo Listen if pep wants better United v. City games he can send him over here. Way more than £70m Would have liked him at United if he didnt play for City Except for us We would 100% go for him. Kolo Muani has been bad enough that he would be loaned or sold (or loan to be sold) and Luis Enrique wants two players per position so with Ramos that is that. Plus he seems exactly the type of player Enrique loves. They did for Jao Felix. Although that's why they won't not with us. but i don’t want him tbf He isn’t even worth £70m he’s a 30m player max Alvarez for 70 mil what are you smoking bro Unless Barca sells Lewa, it could be kind of the same situation (but lesser extent) since Flick is here imo. Is Barca the value brand RM? Bruh. Why does he have to say we will see what happens? Its like leaving a hint that I can come to your team, na I think if we were offered a solid contract, we would have easily got him. Would have loved to see him here but now it's too late.  I also think Endrick was a huge target for us during that time too and that led to just an interest and nothing solid. >The only time Madrid signing Julian Alvarez made sense was directly out of River Plate.  Speaking of which, any news on Mastantouno on your guys' side? Agreed, I really wanted him when he was at River and was upset we didn't throw our name in the hat because I felt that we surely would've got him. Shame he went to City, but it's all sorted for us now up top. yeah lol, he's not exactly a limited player so he can go on the left a bit or play an advanced role in midfield but they have way better players for those too. unless he manages to convert himself into a right winger he will be firmly on the bench even more so than at city, and even if he does get comfortable on the right he's far from assured many minutes, its just the only place he's got any hope at all I don’t anyone can Mbappe in Striker position. At left wing, ofcourse Vini benches him. Or could we make him Alvavinga and play him as an RB? He wants to leave City for the game time and this is what his choice is. Even worse than Man City situation imo. Is it crazy to think he wouldn’t? He’d potentially get more gametime at his preferred striker position  I could see a scenario where the best formation has vini on the left, Julian through the middle, and Mbappe on the right. That makes rodrygo the first sub, endrick rotation, and joselu rotation / last minute set piece prayer.  Even if Mbappe plays through the middle primarily, he’d get a lot of minutes playing as a RW and rotational striker hed better than joselu and endrick and well nobody is  better than mbappe but mbappe is not a striker Yes. I would have loved him too but it's too late now.   The mid and Forward positions are filled and it's more sensible to invest in the defence positions from Real's POV. If Mbappe suffers a bad patch :) Yeah…fuck Bartomeu There's rumours of Rodrygo to City. Can't see it happening and not really fussed on him personally tbh. Its rumours reported by Athletic.  Also I don't think Real would spend that much now. There are defensive positions to be upgraded. Also Endrick is there and he is coming next season. So there are already 2 CFs and an ST in the form of Mbappe, Endrick and Joselu. Which is actually bs btw.  Minutes during 23/24 season:  Alvarez: 3.479'  Haaland: 3.745'  That's like 3 games worth of difference. Also, Alvarez has played more minutes than Haaland in the PL this season. You're his only hope, actually. Other EPL club is a clear downgrade, RM and Bayern have better strikers and Barça too broke to afford him.  PSG has enough money and Luis Enrique playstyle would probably suit him. Sounds like the perfect Mbappé replacement It's absolutely baffling that Psg haven't bid for Bernardo yet. Dude is world class and has a 50 mil release clause. These fansite sources are almost always taken down by mods as well as transfer blog links which this source references. Don't think city would sell him unless Arsenal comes up with a 150+ offer which Arsenal obviously won't. Basing on recent seasons there is no way City will let any highly rated player go to Arsenal. Don't sell yourself short buddy, I'm sure you could go for at least 3.50€ Ah, the Morata special. > and sit on RMA bench...  Sit behind the bench, more like. Bro how badly did you want that Copa Del Rey? I think with him in the team you guys might be able to compete for something. Shame you're stuck with Mbappe coming in instead. Such a first world problem to complain Yeah, you only won La Liga and CL. Goddamn Julian! I rather have Mbappé 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yeah. The only pos currently available is RW and honestly Rodrygo is better than Alvarez at that. I think madrid has zero interest as well, absolutely no reason to sign him with endrick and guler breaking out Well no one is expecting Haaland to stay forever. KDB's best days are behind him. Bernardo's been wanting to leave for about 3 seaons lol.  Who else of the best players do you mean besides players that have already been rumoured to go while Pep's been here and the 3 I already mentioned? The only single one could be Rodri because Foden is going nowhere. Sounds about right, I saw that Bruno to Saudi is on the table Is Chelsea in FFP limits to spend 100M for Alvarez. All those amortized transfers are gonna reflect this season.  And yeah, the second reason too. I seriously doubt if that's the case.   He was on trial at Real when he was 11 or so and won a tournament. He played 5 games. Levy? The guy that brought Spurs Van De Ven, Romero, Son, Maddison, the guy that spent over 50 million for Brennan Johnson?   The idea that Levy is cheap or whatever is tired and boring. Spurs are in a better financial position than any team in the PL and that's with the stadium debt. Spurs will spend money but not in the ""fuck the rules, I have natural gas reserves"" kind of way. Why? He was filling in for KDB when he was out and Haaland when he was out.  As soon as both were back, he was on the bench again. And I'm sure he knows he's not in the long term thinking for replacing KDB. I don't think Alvarez is a better RW than Rodrygo tbh. Rodrygo knows his playing time will be short next season and he actaully mentioned man city being the best club in one of this interviews recently. A Rodrgo Alvarez swap would actually malke sense. Similar to the Alonso - Kroos swap all those years ago. But it's most probably not happening. Would city sell him to those. City might already regret selling Palmer to Chelsea and United might be a big no unless they come up with some exorbitant offer. I mean, we have potentially 71 matches next season. So not a bad idea if we consider only that POV lol. Atletico would actually be a good team imo. But they have to get Felix of the book for that. Would be far fetched but I would like to see Saka.  But bringing an RW means an end to Rodrygo's career here. The current set up ain't bad. Integrating guler more at RW might work wonders. Rodrygo is better at RW than Alvarez though.   > Mbappe can play left  So Vini?  There is also Endrick coming. City aint taking Spotify and whishes as payment tho They have to pull a few more levers and sell some kidneys just to aford the transfer. Dont get me started on salary. Absolutely no player will start ahead of a CF Mbappe at Real. He gives the numbers and his marketability factor is much ahead of the rest.  So unless he plays RW, he would be benched. Even at RW he will face Rodrygo. And Guler who can also play there. And that's exactly what will happen if he goes to Real too. Hazard's career was ruined due to injuries and not benching. A vini who was misfiring was preferred over him most of the time. 1 game that he was preferred and Vini was played as RB, Real lost to Chelsea. Real Madrid since Spain is a very good country to live and Hispanic/Latino can relate a lot there.  Barca was also in the mix for this but not now since they are in a financial mess and in bad condition. Yeah. But realistically, they would get the most money from Prem now as the other team which can spend a lot got Mbappe. Him wanting to leave makes sense, dreaming of playing for Real too. But now it's such an unrealistic move that is just lazy writing. Better way to demand a salary or play time increase would be to leak that he wants to go strike for United  or Liverpool. Madrid? C'mon. I'm Pep, I'd have laughed. Forget about competing with Mbappe and Vini, I don't know if he's even close to Rodrygo's level to compete for minutes. He would fit like a glove for Atlético, they ""just"" need to get rid of Felix first. Who is Ray and why does he get a cup? *better quality 3rd string players Who needs a transfer budget when you have mbappe turning down a billion dollars to come on a free. I refuse to believe anybody actually believes that madrid would struggle to get anyone.  Even the other T1 clubs have to lament how our players are always going to leave us for Madrid and Barca (as long as Barca can pay the players...). It's some insane mental gymnastics to think that the club that's signed Mbappe and Bellingham within the last year can't compete with signings. They don't need to outspend everyone when practically every player on the planet dreams of playing for them. who has the highest wage bill? please don't say its us Yeah, dunno who said that but I think we've never really had any doubts that we're one of the very few top clubs that even very good players would want to join even if we had no interest in them. Seriously, it's annoying to see RM fans complaining about such first world problems. Who has the highest wage bill, I'm assuming City? They don't have the second highest wage bill 2nd highest? Pretty sure I recently saw a post putting us within the same realm as Bayern and Liverpool, quite far off second place in terms of amount  Not that I agree with the can’t compete statement, just pointing out What a weird narrative you are framing. The complaints were always about the league winners in the other Top4 leagues barely getting as much as relegated sides in the PL, and also fan-owned clubs (I know, foreign concept to you Brits) having huge disadvantages to billionaire and state owned clubs as in the PL. Both Barca and Madrid. Over the years plenty of Prem players, in their peak, with ‘Latin’ connections have made the journey to Spain. Source for second highest wage bill? [UEFA themselves has us at 5th place](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F7qgvqhpypzic1.jpeg) Uhmmm we have the 5th largest wage bill in Europe, so very very much the underdog here. All the last 9 UCL’s have been an underdog story, thank you very much!   Sauce: https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/1rC1s7Zzpl i’ve seen a startling amount of “nobody thought we could win” sentiments from madrid fans after beating city in the CL quarterfinals Who has the audacity to say that as a Madrid fan lmao. Tebas and Perez love this narrative. Always acting like underdogs See the thing is both are true, when you see perez or a madrid fan talking about this it’s typically for the future, madrid are panicking right now even if they are getting UCL’s along the way, what Perez wants to fight is basically the oil money, idk why r/soccer don’t get the fact itms not today that anybody is worried about but tomorrow, when things go haywire the gap will be extreme. This is a strawman, perhaps one made inadvertently if not disingenuously but still one. What Florentino has always argued about us competing with seemingly bottomless wells (pun not intended) of money as a club whose finances are out in the open as opposed to the former and which has to be self-sustaining, on its merits as opposed to the former (allegedly).  ""115"" and this are the same thing IINM. It's then a bit hard to understand how this forum bandies around one but rallies against the other.  Even on paper, solely in revenue, City was often rivalling what most consider to be the best run clubs in the world, if not eclipsing them. There are then a thousand other allegations of shady and/or under the table dealings.  This is not to say that the legacy clubs themselves are squeaky clean (the infamous Neymar deal being the obvious example, where as it turned out eventually, even the club suffered, suffering misappropriation of funds). But the context is wildly different. What's more like in the Girona deal, as you would expect, they haven't been completely stupid that you could absolutely nail them. Mbappe, Endrick, Vinicius, Rodrygo, Bellingham as a potential 10  Literally 0 squad space for him surely He would’ve actually been so good in that number nine position… Can make great runs in behind, has flare, and has a good work-rate. Mbappes been Perez’s favorite for 6/7 years now, no way Perez chooses anyone over Mbappe. Yup, would be a great ST option last season but not next season with the addition of Endric and Mbappe Why not? Surely he can start over Rodrygo. He would work extremely well with Mbappe and Vinicius He can be a nice backup to Jovic MCI already said they aren’t loaning him out £75m ballpark. If Hojland went for £72m and Kolo Muani was €95m, Isak €70m and Nunez €85m  the year before. 80-100M imo. He is a good player who ain't playing just cause Haaland is at Man City. And he would be an obv starter for almost all teams except Real, City and Bayern. Yeah I'm sure Spurs is his second choice after RM We could and probably should but I doubt Alvarez would want a move here Curious how he’d fit their current squad. Seems Ange’s system fits a more physical target man, but Alvarez’s work-rate might make up for his lack in size. Remember that Angel DiMaria's quote? I think he’d rather stay at City than go to Tottenham though Why would he go there, no chance of winning anything ever Why would he go to Spurs lmao. He’s way too good to give up on winning trophies at the young age of 24. He could go to plenty of clubs that win things. > Would absolutely give you £75m for him  we know. And 60m for Olise. 40m for Summerville. 65m for De Ligt,etc...  Might have finished in a conference league qualification spot but the real season begins in 3 days for Chelsea Yea but Chelsea were only able to get Sterling because City didn't want him anymore, it's gonna be a different environment selling a player they actually want to keep to a league rival  Not saying they wont, City tend to sell players that don't want to be there, but it's not gonna be cheap Ragnick wanted him :((( Even better if he comes and scores a hat trick against them. We seriously need help at striker. that doesn't matter What are YOU smoking? >it could be kind of the same situation  are you talking about roque? Because he wants to leave but is not willing to down tools. Is just like Bernardo situation Because thats what a player says when he wants to open the door. Now is his agent job to find him another club.   Maybe a good offer comes, maybe not. Problem with this kid is that every EPL club would be a downgrade, Bayern and Madrid have better strikers,and Barça is broke. So not many options left. Maybe PSG. Could or couldn't be, i think he wants things to happen respectively with the club whether it would be a transfer or a game time for him.  Honestly, even I'm puzzled about it, it's subjective but i prefer him more than haaland as game looks more fluid with him compared to haaland but I can understand the argument of haaland too. Football player need to stop saying ""we will see what happens"" it always makes things worse 😭 I think so too. If Madrid were really in for him, they would’ve gotten him. I’d always been extremely disappointed that the club didn’t go in for him considering they’ve always had a pretty good experience signing ex-River Plate Argentinian strikers... It is what is though. Guess the club had other ideas/interests. The disappointment has mellowed out though considering how insanely stacked Real Madrid is at striker now. I've heard there will be a free spot in Castilla I mean, if it was last year he would be pretty desirable. Now that we have gotten Mbappe and Endrick and Joselu, then discovered Jude potential as a 10, and also thinking about Wirtz this is basically impossible. > would have loved him too but it's too late now  That's what she said 😞 There will be an exodus of players when Pep leaves next summer. Alvarez is only putting his name out there for when that happens. Any team from City is going to be a downgrade, he probably just wants a bigger role Could come to Arsenal . . . Going to psg is a downgrade. He won’t achieve anything there. He is trying to upgrade not go to Ligue 1. Hope? My man plays with Messi, I think he might have had a word to dodge that club I thought barca got some nice change from Nike. They can give him the same wages they did to Lewa and let the financial ruin continue. Since we dont have anywhere to play him, this would be a win for us!! Psg gas tried to get him this year and last year. He prefers spain True, depsite them not having such a big part lately, both the Jesus and Zinchenko moves were a huge catalyst for Arsenal's recent ressurgance, no question. Goddamn loch ness monster It would be nice to win the treble once I guess, one thing Barca has over us for sure. I mean I get it, Mbappe is the better player for sure, but scheme wise, he would have fitted better, now someone has to give in and play in a not favored position, if we win and everyone scores then it won't be a problem. But if the team starts losing or things don't go our way you can be sure the first thing Mbappe/Vini/Rodrygo will think is ""Damn what if I was playing on the left, they make me play out of position and we are losing because of that""   With just Vini and Rodrygo you can juggle them just fine like Carlo has done until now, but now with 3 guys and one that knows he's the best in the world. I don't think it will be that easy. Hope I'm wrong I find these comments curious, what's Real Madrid supposed to do? To not try to get better? It's funny how opinions change, at the start of the season we were being laughed at for not going for Kane and signing Joselu as the lone true center forward of the team. But now we suddenly are perfect and should not change anything lmao We could afford 70M for him. Especially if 2-3 of Maatsen/Broja/Gallagher/Chalobah get pushed out. Oh, that's interesting. you're not wrong but spurs record signing is still only like 60 million. Realistically they'd need to spend like 70+ to get Alvarez. Not sure what kind of wages he'd want either, but I wouldn't be surprised if he'd want wages high enough that would alter Spurs wage structure, which I think is substantially lower than City/United/Arsenal/Chelsea They’re not in a better financial position than any team don’t be silly. Revenues not close to United city and Liverpool and their owners don’t put a penny in unlike most other clubs. Agreed. Hmm I guess I was thinking one of Mbappe or vini can play rw  Endrick is a super sub year 1 What happened to the power of friendship yeah, RM is too stacked and makes no sense for him now. I mean, the country to live in argument is eeehhhh…it must be language more than just it being Spain. There are many great places in Europe to live that definitely smash Madrid/Spain, let’s be real.  Edit: also to he clear, Madrid is a fantastic city and Spain a nice country but I feel there are a lot of places that are better to live all year round than Spain in general. Just a personal view. They’d only get like 20m more and I’m sure a few extra points are way more valuable to them than 20m Copa del Raymond Kopa. Idk but he isn't vety popular. I see people wearing glasses everywhere, calling to ban him. Mbappe was hardly free. Part of what would have been the transfer fee was just paid to him as a signing bonus (€100m) If PSG wanted to sell him, they had the chance multiple times for the last few years. They clearly didn't want to and going on a free was the only way this was going to happen. I think they were just trying to build an underdog narrative rather than legitimately believing it. Total bollocks though. Real Madrid is probably the only team in the world that everyone would love to go to. You could be in the best situation possible and still want to go to Madrid. Their clout is undeniable 😭😭. If any of us think we’re too poor to compete for like the big name signing of the summer, they’re wrong. We obviously have the pull and the liquid cash to sign whoever the hot 100M signing would be.   Where people are correct, though, is that if we signed Hazard and Jovic in 2019 and followed it up with an Arthur or a Pjanic type signing for 60+M in 2020 and they flopped, and we go trophyless, and then in 2021 give it one last try and go for Grealish and Lukaku for 200M and they both flop and we go trophyless again…we’re stuck with 5-6 deadwood players and no money and no trophies or future. There is no extra 700M after that like city or Newcastle have now. Perez has gotten it almost perfect, leaving only minor holes in the squad where we can fill them with one giant signing, and yes obviously we’re no underdogs in the race to sign a Jude, or an Mbappe. But if Jude became Nuri Sahin and Mbappe became Hazard, it’s a long hard road to come back from, being publicly owned, rather than just dumping them for pennies and signing the next giant star.   We also don’t have the benefit of stealing talent from within la liga like Bayern seem to get every Bundesliga starlet and city get every smaller club PL starlet. We’ve inquired on guys like pau torres or Diego Carlos and get told they cost like double whatever they end up going to the PL for I'd also prefer to live in Barcelona or Madrid rather than the sunny London or Manchester given everything else is equal Yeah, in fact the power of their brand is so strong they could probably offer half the salary that other clubs pay and still everyone would want to play for them.  Not to mention that in Ancelotti they also have a coach which isn’t a slave to any system and pretty much lets everyone play whatever position they are most comfortable in.  Those chasing the bag go to Arabia or any of the Arab-owned European clubs. But players who want to build an actual career will always come knocking on RM’s door.  And if Real comes asking, who in their right mind would say no? No such player in the world.  That’s the power of the brand and legacy. And at the end of the day, when your history is so rich, you don’t need to overpay for anything the way young money upstarts such as PSG or Man City have to. Players literally reject big offers from English teams to sit and wait for Barca Real offers lol. Look at that ridiculous summer we had where Barca would keep swooping in for players we basically had lined up to sign. And this year Real are doing that with Leny Yoro. PSG apparently I’m ngl my mind immediately went to United How many comments like that do you see, realistically? That guy has almost 2k upvotes over a single comment he read with a RM flair, as if it was a common opinion. That shit isn't common at all lmao There are like 2-3 such comments from madrid flaira and peeps in this sub take it that it's a popular belief among madrid fans. PSG apparently but it could well be City. Think a lot of clubs effectively hide wages by paying bonuses and through other routes that aren't included. Very likely City but they hide their wages well. Barca have higher than ours No, I'm referring specifically to a comment I saw that was specifically talking about Madrid struggling. It wasn't supposed to be a wider comment on anything. I am well aware of the financial disparity between the PL and other leagues. I'm just laughing at a Madrid fan trying to claim they're hard up, when they can out-compete basically anyone.  I wasn't referring to any comments by the club, or Perez, or anyone else. Specifically a comment I read on this subreddit. I would have thought the first line of my comment made that clear. You are just talking about City and Newcastle. LFC, United, Spurs owners don't put their money into the club. They expect the club to cover everything and make them money on the side. Barca would be spending more if they could. LFC and Spurs aren't even at the FFP limit and United pays their owners dividends. Real Madrid isn't at some huge disadvantage here. Somehow, I think you'll be okay. - you're the top club in the world, I don't know if anyone would say oetherwise - you haven't royally screwed your finances, like Barca - your bench could potentially win UCL  Kroos retiring would leave most clubs in the lurch. The fact that you've got to choose which world-class midfielder to disappoint by not giving them Kroos' minutes tells you everything.   What's happening in the future? Is sheer corruption nipping at your heels? I'd worry more about rising temperatures, and how *one day* Madrid will be too hot for most people. Until then, life is sweet - enjoy. Oil money is one thing (although we still only have one true dominating oil team in Man City, who *may* get killed by 115 in the next year), but Madrid keeps talking up how one day they can't compete with the Premier League, which is simply untrue. The Premier League is about plateauing in popularity (signified by how their new revenue deal stays relatively flat with inflation), and Madrid still kicks their ass every year. Ig that just what happens when you suck LaLiga dry of money for decades and the only other team that does that (Barcelona) is incompetent. Carvajal is ageing tho; not too late to learn how to cross And the potential of Wirtz (who would become the 10 and drop Jude deeper) next summer.  Plus Joselu as the backup striker.  Ya there's simply no room anymore. Don't forget Arda and Brahim Endrick won't play much in his 1st year. Rodrygo isn't as surefire lock as a squad member as is broadly made out. Perez has sold players managers liked when club needed to close yearly budget many times before. Depends how much Perez is in love with his Brazillian and how much the latter wants to be around while not having a guaranteed spot.  I still don't really believe anyone in the backroom is seriously looking at it as a transfer And even then you’re leaving out Arda and Brahim out too. And he'll still go because it's Real Madrid. Yes. But if Mbappe is starting as a CF. No player is going to get ahead of him if we consider everything. Does he have the hold up play for that? I guess maybe you could delegate that aspect to Bellingham and have Alvarez largely play off him. Aren't flares banned these days? Yea. The only guy who can potentially be equal to Mbappe is Vini as he is the redemption for losing Neymar. I am not sure if Alvarez is a better RW than Rodrygo is. It will also hinder his growth like it is hindering Rodrygo's now as he can't play his fav position. The only people who think Alvarez would ""surely"" start over Rodrygo are people who don't watch Rodrygo. Is he more of a RW? Wait Luka Jovic moved to Milan? Wow can't believe I missed that.  Has he been good or does he still have an allergy for touching the ball outside the box. It was deadline day but that Kolo Muani figure is still crazy, especially considering he was a free transfer the year before these numbers are all ridiculous tbh. throw vlahovic in there at similar numbers, and none of them lived up to the price tag or even close. These numbers are so astronomically distorted. PSG spending almost 100mio for 12 goals... Different situations, they all needed to be pried away from their clubs. Alvarez wants to go and city don’t tend to hold on to players that want to leave. Honestly, maybe I'll get flak from other Liverpool fans for saying this, but I would pay that in a heartbeat. I think he's a fairly substantial upgrade on Darwin. Not saying he's not worth that, but it's kind of crazy that he went for £14m, wasn't even a regular starter, and now he's worth 5 times that amount. Mainly just makes me feel bad for River Plate, teams can basically buy their best players at a discount solely because they're in South America, whereas the same player being sold but Man City has a premium attached to their sale price Arsenal should go for him >Kolo Muani was €95m  How did I miss that, fucking hell If you're using them as the examples then he's north of £100m. Sighting those numbers makes it clear he would be 90-100 Those are not the same kind of sign.  He is leaving the big club, not going into it. this is way too much. he is a proven top player, but the past two years he is a substitute/rotation option. he sorta has to prove himself again He would start for bayern behind Kane. Musiala as a lw He has started more premier league games than Haaland this year lol Alvarez played the most games for City this year Hell yes I'd be happy if Spurs paid $100M for him. At that point it's basically just swapping Kane for Alvarez, and it's not like that money really could be better spent elsewhere. julian is a much better player than haaland who always ghosted in important matches. the kid is a world cup winner Someone has only seen Ange at Spurs and started yapping lmaoo Ange has several quotes written about how he wants to keep the ball on the ground at all times - inspired by his own father yelling it at the TV all morning. the only time we win is on transfers so bring it on. They wanted to keep Cole Palmer and now he's Chelsea's best player. But I agree the displayed level of success between Palmer and Alvarez is sufficiently different that it's not a good 1:1 comparison. > league rival  I appreciate your optimism Hojlund is a better prospect than alvarez 70 million for 11 league goals  is a robbery, extremely overrated player world cup 2022 did wonders for him No no. With Lewa.   Unless Alvarez goes for like 10 games missing, there is no way Roque would go ahead of him. Yeah. Every other day, I see some rumours about Bernardo to some club. It’s funny how it doesn’t really feel like no one likes to play for city Yeah. That's what I meant. He doesn't seem to be fully committed at City.  PSG would have to sell RKM for him to come ig. And selling RKM will come with a massive loss now. The other angle is that the club might decide to sell him even if he wants to stay… I understand that. For Real i would take him over Haaland cause I think he suits better than Haaland.  But if you can make a system where you can feed Haaland every time, there won't be a better player (in terms of numbers) than him. And he also trailed for us when he was 11 and played 5 games or so.  The club is so Endrick as more appealing. And in the marketing front, Endrick is more appealing as he is already seen as a Pele regen. I mean, look at his pictures coming out. Have never seen this PR in a young player like this bar Yamal. He didn’t want to go to RMA, he wanted to go to City. Yeah. But I doubt if we would go for him last season too because it is almost certain that Mbappe will come this season.   And wirtz is also a weird one. Yes he has the creativity but we already have 4 world class  played to fill 3 positions if we go 4 3 3. Obviously there's no denying Peps pull but none of us were expecting Haaland to stay forever, KDB is on the decline, Bernardo has been open about leaving while Pep is still here. Who else do you predict in the exodus because of Pep's departure?  >Alvarez is only putting his name out there for when that happens.  Or he's unsatisfied since as soon as both Haaland and KDB were fit he was straight back on the bench and would leave this summer. Except Madrid. Madrid > City >Any team from City is going to be a downgrade  No. Real Madrid is an upgrade, Bayern and even Barça could be argued as better for his career, sidegrade at worst.  City is a disgusting cheating club and might end relegated. Doubt City wants to sell to their main PL rival. He's only won 2 PLs and a CL give it a couple more seasons at least before he embraces a trophyless club career. Nah Julián Álvarez is in his prime, he's no Halaand but still a good player.   I prefer them signing another City reject in his 30's and giving a 5 years contract on huge wages like they did with Lewa or Gundogan.  Bernardo Silva is gettin 30 this summer, go for him Barça! In that case, Barca would still have that over you since they did it twice Madrid’s already playing Rodrygo in a not favored position, so I don’t understand why that would make a difference Yeah. But these players should be pushed out.  Maatsen can be done easily do as Broja if I am sure. Not sure of other 2. Vini isn't good at RW. Mbappe can play but he doesn't want to play there now.  Yeah, Endrick will be rotational now. But Alvarez is 24 only. So. It would be nice to see him playing for barca but let’s be Real, barca is poor af By country i meant everything including the language and culture. And the weather and all also plays a role in it.   Yes there are many places to live and a lot better than Madrid but how many of those places have a top club. I think Alvarez would easily go for 110+ to a Prem team. But a team from another country would be at 70ish.  But if it's just 20M, yeah, better to sell him like that. He would have demanded a big fat signing bonus even if RMA would have had to pay for the transfer.   Not a 100 mil sure but surely something. And that something wouldn't have been small too. Half of that is realistically his wages, even though that's still a big bonus. RM overall saved money vs paying $200M to PSG, and also paying Mbappe a high salary, much higher than his current base salary excluding bonuses. 100m on five years.. 20m per year + 15m yearly salary is a good deal . Which is honestly peanuts for a player like Mbappé Exactly, in their world as long as psg gets no money they’re winning 100m for Mbappe is a bargain. Signing bonus was €180M by the way. Hardly a free signing They're making it on their own terms and because of their own success. It really is of their own doing. Not the league and its inept leaders and the shitty TV deals, not the nation state cash flooding in whenever needed, etc.  In terms of that, they ARE the underdog. Or an exception to the rule. Italian clubs have crumbled financially, Barca have, German clubs can't compete with the EPL, the French never could, etc.  It's just Madrid (and Bayern, to a point). Not really an underdog narrative, just that they're not in the city/psg/chelsea/united/arsenal tier of shoveling money into a furnace of transfer fees.   Like you pointed out though, their wage bill is massive, and it's not like they don't spend a decent chunk on transfers. They’re obviously a very well run club which is why they’re so successful but you get comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1d6bulp/jose_mourinho_on_carlo_ancelotti_hes_not_a_social/l6rvjp6/) acting like they’re just top tier bargain hunters and do all this winning without splashing money because they sign the best prospects in the world before their prime and the best players in their prime on frees with ridiculous wages But the way in which FFP/PSR is now structured it prevents these clubs with the access to ‘cash’ as you put it in the way of Newcastle and potentially Villa neither of them can spend it because the way everything is accounted means the historically big clubs like RMA and in the premier league Man U/Chelsea can waste more and afford to absorb these hits of a poor £60 million player which you claim would cripple Madrid if you signed a few.   Also players who move on to Madrid and the other big clubs will always have a bit of a resell back to other clubs such as Sancho this window, and previously the likes of Zaha, Lukaku, Pogba etc. it might have been in the world of uninhibited spending you might have got left behind but under the current rules it helps big clubs to make a few mistakes as if an up and coming club makes one error in signing it ruins them.   Also it seems from RMA denying going to the World Club tournament that you can demand €20 mill a game so really you only need to do a few of them and you get paid back. People also ignore that Real Madrid has just as money as the PL’s top clubs too because of the narrative that the PL is so wealthy. The major gap between PL spending and other leagues is the 100m per team TV deal all teams in the league get, which is an amount of money that means a lot more to smaller clubs than it does to the huge clubs. Levers I’m guessing that’s before Mbappe moved, gotta be Madrid now Ah yes, the good old 'Qatar World Cup Ambassadorship' payment, how could I forget... No we certainly don't,  22-23 probably, but 23-24 no way. Not for much longer with Mbappe being the highest paid player on the team. Which is correct, everybody has their own opinions about this and their own justifications the thing is a lot of these people at the executive level think way ahead and not just right now, you think Perez stops thinking or planning if they win another champions league? The margins are very thin. Have you learnt nothing from Barcelona? Shit can fall anytime at this level as they say being at the top is difficult but staying at the top is more difficult, I just don’t get why people act surprised here when the management wants to do everything in their control to stay at the top “today” and “tomorrow” keeping in mind Madrid doesn’t have unlimited resources, we don’t have an oil well that we can get money from, Perez is doing just that, it’s lucky that he runs shit in a good way, but shit can go down so fast once he retired or goes away from the club. God damn you guys collecting the infinity stones or something 😭 Wtf I missed the news of Wirtz agreeing to terms with Real, thats crazy. Just casually adding one of the best german talent's in years, and he's only 21.. CL qualification just got a little scarier Did we buy Joselu? [deleted] > Plus Joselu  Still hilarious to read this jude can do that but .. why?   for the sake of la liga, please let wirtz go to barca 😩 4-2-4. Let Valverde do his thing as the sole defensive midfielder That was my thinking. No, Alvarez probably can’t do the physical sort of hold-up play, but he would certainly be able to drop deeper to receive the ball and dribble forward with it. Alvarez is just not very good anywhere outside of striker. He played on the midfield for city due to injuries but it wasn’t very good outside of his final 3rd play because he got act more as a second striker. Maybe not surely start but Alvarez would definitely rotate in the starting lineup with him. He can send Mbappe to the wing. He can play in all positions in attack, mostly on the right side, but he is least effective as a 10, though Guardiola Is still training him for that role.  Anyways, I'm not saying you should. Money is probably better invested in defense, but you can. And considering that he’s been ass it's psg His world cup final performance is what put him on the radar for most clubs. Before that, he was just another unknown French player. Isak is pretty good tbh Isak is special, the best thing about him is that he creates his own goals without having 10 threading passes, he is scrapping barrels in Newcastle and still got 21 goals in 30 games huh? Hojlund has one season in the prem in a shit team. His returns weren't even bad That's not that true. City DO hold onto players - best example is Bernardo.  All the big name players that leave - Sane, Sterling Jesus weren't fundamental to the way Pep plays.  FWIW I cannot see Alverez leaving this window. Pep really likes him, he played a lot early season, he just got squeezed later in the season with Foden's form and KdB coming back from injury and firing. He will need to be pried. He has a 5 year contract with the club, we like him. He will get significant minutes next year. He will never be the 9 while haaland is there but he can definitely be the supporting 9. Well they are different players but he would be good for Liverpool. He's not a substantial upgrade. The way some Liverpool fans talk about Darwin is crazy. I'd love for us to sign him too for that price, but there's not a chance City sells to either us or Arsenal. I agree, as a staunch Liverpool supporter and scouser. They're different players what. In fact they would complement each other very well. Bro's  league personal best is 11 goals 🫠  Edit, people are not happy with this information lmaoo Why doesn't some smart team just sign everyone from River Plate and enjoy all the winning from having better players with lower spending? Doubt they’d sell to us anymore but I’d take him in a heartbeat. he got 31 starts in the Premier League last season and played the 5th most minutes of any City player - only Rodri, Ederson, Foden, and Walker played more. A World Cup leading forward with great metrics despite playing across the entire front line while rarely having a single role to play. He's going for at least €75 million no question. He played more minutes than nearly every other forward in the league last season - including Haaland...  5th most on the team, more than other big money signing like Darwin, Hojlund, Isak for example, on and on and on.   Really is a ridiculous take. Yeah. But the market is that much inflated right now. He doesn't need to prove anything. Every time he plays, he does great things. Literally only reason he is not playing every time is because Haaland is ahead of him. Every team would love to have Alvarez. He doesn't start for barca,arsenal,leipzig,napoli and inter Why push musiala out of position Yeah but still a second fiddle to haaland. He won't be able to start at his position. As a KDB replacement because his skill set is that diverse. But not in his fav position when haaland is around right. He would be a second fiddle. Hi there Roy Yeah. But we can argue that he makes space for those long shots to be taken in most of those matches too. Bernard Diomede and Roque Junior are World Cup winners. It's not really a good argument alone. There’s an interesting argument. Robot vs WC winner I don’t think we’ve won many transfers recently… You're right though, I'd forgotten about him, but I think even City didn't realise he was going to be that much of a success, so £50m or whatever they paid probably was a semi fuck-off price, but in hindsight it looks a bargain Would be nice to have both though. But 65 for Kai havertz at the time was fine wasn’t it? I'm not sure which situation with lewa you're talking about, but I forgot to clarify that I was talking about signing him next season It's been just Barca mainly. I think there was some PSG rumour from last year but I don't give that any credit.  Barca is where he wants to go. That's been going on for like 4 years now. Have you ever lived in Manchester? It's a depressing City Atlético then. If i was them id break the bank for Álvarez. And for him it'd be a stepping stone before eventually going to Barça if/when they put their shit together finantially. There’s absolutely no way a Latin American player would ever prefer to play for an English club over Real Madrid or Barcelona. Especially, an Argentinian. If Real Madrid truly wanted Julian, they would have gotten him.  I think he meant other clubs which need a striker In club history yeah, in the modern day they're basically the same. They both play at the highest level and are basically guaranteed CL semifinalists. You're almost certainly right He can be in his prime and score 40 goals a season but the club will collapse if they keep making dumb financial decisions.. And not just that, they have the Sextete as well, but winning a treble for the first time in the club history is still something to chase, don't you think? So, you don't see the problem with having 3 left wingers and no one to play naturally on the right?. That's what I said I hope I'm wrong but it will be very possible that one of them will look for opportunities elsewhere if things go south. If we can produce enough wonder kids through the academy and sell them, anything is possible (this sounds a lot like juman trafficking) Napoli 😎😎 No doubt. It was a win win for RMA and Mbappe and a loss for PSG Considering what RM and Barca were paying CR7 and Messi a few years back, Mboopy at 15 mil is an absolute steal. Damn, this just struck me too. It’s only Bayern and Madrid. Every other non-English giant has faded. I think underdog is the wrong word, but there is still something to be said for what you’ve described. They have the Spanish government helping them tho https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/real-madrid/20210301/6261751/real-madrid-florentino-perez-galacticos-torres.amp.html Transfer fee doesn't matter when players just wait for their contract to expire and go to real madrid, no club would be able to do that. That's the biggest power for a club to wield in the modern day of football. They’ve spent over 160 million on three brazilian teenagers in that last few years. An absurd comment. Because they operate an extremely smart strategy. But everyone knows they are more than able to compete on transfer fees with those clubs when they choose to.  They bought Bellingham for €103m, up to €133 with add-ons included iirc Didn’t they offer €200 million for Mbappe last year? They can burn as much money as they want, they just don’t have to because of their pedigree and reputation with players. Didn’t they literally give mbappe a £100m sign on fee? Plus pay £100m for Bellingham last season? The fuck you mean they don’t shovel money into a furnace of transfer fees? You might want to check how much they’ve spent on midfielders in the last few years Well I think Carlo’s numbers were way off there but in theory, yes obviously we have a lot of different avenues to make money and recoup money. I see I’m already getting downvoted but I will reiterate we are not underdogs financially. But we have to actually do things to make money unlike the state owned clubs. But as we are seeing now, breaking the rules like city doesn’t matter if you just literally have even more money to hold up the judiciary process and appeal stuff, etc. I doubt that.  According to reports Mbappe has a similar wage compare to Bellingham and Vini. much lower compare to what was offered in 2022 saga.  That with Kroos retiring and Modric taking a wage cut to extend for 1 year (probably his last) who were the other 2 in top 4 madrid wage, i dont think the total wage changed that much. It’s because there is a hate boner for Madrid on here. Remember the Almeria game, and the fallout on here from that? But the outrage wasn’t even close to that after the Valencia game. You think a Chelsea supporter doesn't know that it can all fall apart overnight?  But I really can't think of a club that's in a better position. Not City, not PSG - look at what that oil money is buying them. Chelsea is being run by moneymen, but at least it looks like they've mostly handed over the keys to football professionals.  Things come & go, nothing lasts forever, but I wouldn't fret so much if I were RMA right now - the future looks bright. Like collecting infinity stones for a backup gauntlet. They’re so stacked they hardly have room for backup roles. He’s gonna have to play with the U23s These fuckers get everything and everyone they want No terms are agreed but Real has been active.   But it's reported by BILD. So only take with a pinch of salt. Still early, but I'd imagine Madrid are the leaders at this point in time.  Things could change though. Definitely not a ""need"" with Arda and Brahim already on the squad who have similar profiles.  But Wirtz is obviously better right now and has a ton of potential.  Flo just looks to sign the best, so it makes sense to me.  Wirtz would be the starting CAM imo, which would slot Jude as more of a traditional 8 playing deeper, probably moreso on the left side.  Then you'd have Fede on the right and Tchou as the CDM.  Cama has been a bench player this year and he's versatile enough where you can play him anywhere in the midfield and at LB as well. No That's setting the team up for failure.  And there is Tchou, Bellingham, Camavinga all in the team. Lol that's how PSG played with Mbappe Neymar Icardi Cavani Di Maria etc Yeah. He is a proper SS/CF type player which would be extremely hard to get at Real now PSG making smart business as usual. Who couldve guessed that paying 100m for a 1 year wonder wasnt good business. He had 15 goals and 11 assists in Bundesliga with Frankfurt last season. He's just a bad fit at PSG, and ultimately is too limited on the ball for high intensity games. i can get behind that - a striker for 70mio should always exceed 20 goals a season with the potential for 30. hes very injury prone unfortunately. fantastic player though Yeah given his age, output, and eye test he is probably going to make the fee look reasonable if 70mo can't buy you 20goals a season then it can't possibly have been a good transfer. you have players like solanke scoring more for 20mio...my argument is that 70mio should always be able to get you 20+ a season, otherwise it makes no sense. There are plenty of better options out there otherwise. City won’t let players leave for less than what they’re worth, but if Bernardo had pressed the issue AND a club met the asking price, he’d be free to leave. Bernardo never pressed the issue, he was perfectly fine with staying.  If someone wants to go they do not force them to stay. We’re not holding Bernardo he pretty much only wants the big Spanish 3. So unless they come in with a reasonable bid he’s happy at city, just hates the weather > City DO hold onto players - best example is Bernardo.  City will sell any player who wants to leave, but they're not a charity. They've told Bernardo for plenty of years to get his agent to find a team to make a reasonable bid and nobody has. Forget reasonable actually, City made him £50m in Covid year, and he has a £50m release clause now, that's a bargain. They didn't force Bernardo to stay, they convinced him to. didnt sterling have the most appearances for pep out of any player? or was it most minutes? How many minutes from both? So same as Nunez... 🤷‍♂️ How many goals? and yet he still sat on the bench in important games whenever everyone was fit. which is what a rotation option is. Which is like 65mm gbp let’s call it, 65-75 is probably the right price for someone who wants to leave. Is it though. Seems like most clubs are hamstrung and can't spend much. Seems like transfer fees will need to reduce to more realistic figures. I volunteer my team to test this out.  For science. He did absolutely nothing in the FA Cup final when he came on He's really good on the wing. The alternative is playing inferior players like sane or gnabry Yea not always in his preferred position but just passing along a surprising stat I saw. I would've said he doesn't play much and needs a move away but saw that and made me reconsider. Obviously he wasn't first in minutes since he was a sub a lot of the time but he was still like 6th in minutes too. He plays more than people think  Like our player with this most games this year was Hojbjerg which was also shocking to see but he was like 15th in minutes because it was always late cameos *confused Mudryk noises* The 21-year-old completed a surprise £40m transfer from the Etihad Stadium to Stamford Bridge on Deadline Day Not for even half the price city would ask for. Alvarez is worth max 50m Did I say that ?😐 Oh. Next season would be better. I was talking about this season.  That Lewa would be a starter since Flick is here at least this season. I think PSG is also interested but Lucho might not want him.  Barca should try for DM first before anything else. Yeah. Atletico is a nice option but their finances aren't the best iirc (in wages). So they would have to get Felix off their book to come and get Alvarez. I mean, that’s an assumption based on your personal opinion. At MCI he had the chance to learn and develop under Pep. This time last year everyone was saying that it would be Haaland’s last or second last year at City and Alvarez would be taking the torch when he leaves. The PL is a stronger league which has challenged him more than La Liga would have. Plus City had a better chance at winning major trophies, including the UCL, than Madrid did - and he would had been right, the season he joined City, Barca won La Liga and City won the UCL (and treble). Hindsight is a funny thing, isn’t it?   Apparently Madrid, and other clubs, were in on him but River Plate wanted him to finish the season, which City were okay with. If he *really* wanted Madrid, he would’ve pushed the issue and told them to let him go right away, especially since Madrid were lacking striker options. Username checks out.   No, they arent the same. Not even close.  Even if we ignore history or the 115 charges,  City is still owned by an oil state   Real Madrid is owned by the fans. Don't worry, we'll get Septuple (7) next year. This will silence any barca fan👌🏻 A stone in the ocean for them lot though. My favourite part about this drawn out saga is that it ended up with a loss for PSG Oh dear lord what will become of them. They’ll have to settle for winning the league with a slightly smaller margin and no CL trophies… oh wait… What were they paying them?  IIRC, Messi was at €50m net and CR7 was at €30 net. Mbappe is right in between    They also had a level of celebrity and stardom that Mbappe doesn't have yet. Football is unpredictable. Barca were La Liga champions a couple of years ago. In a couple of years time they could be back to winning Champions leagues. PSG could get over the CL hurdle at some point in the next few years with lucho. Leverkusen just went unbeated in the BL and almost won an invinsible treble. who would have predicted that last year. Who knows where they will be in the next couple of years if they are able to build on Alonso's success (assuming he leaves). I still remember that famous phonecall into talksport 7 or 8 years ago when the Chelsea fan proclaimed they had 'outgrown the premier league' Didn't need to go very far to find out that it was factually wrong...  The argument of the article is essentially that re-zoning of the area Real Madrids old training ground, from non-commercial to commercial (which is one discussion) and then selling it to the city of Madrid (which is not true) was a scandal.  The last part, regarding selling the lands to the City of Madrid was actually investigated by the European Commission on behest of among others Manchester United and FC Barcelona. And the findings was that there was no transfer of funds directly or indirectly from the city of Madrid or the Autonomous Community of Madrid. That is one of footballs most enduring myths. The reason for this myth is I believe that there were big headlines in the media when the 'accusation' from Man Utd and Barcelona was made. But when the European Commission made their conclusions, there was nothing in the papers, leaving people with the accusation and believing it was true.  So the last part is just factually incorrect in that article. As for the re-zoning of the area, this is more a matter of opinion and La Vanguardia has their obvious bias (hint: their based in Barcelona). See people would ask why would the city of Madrid re-zone the area, and I would actually wonder why not. I mean it was a non-commercial area in essentially private hands, in an area the financial district of Madrid was growing into. It really made no sense to force it to remain non-commercial, unless of course you just hated Real Madrid. And even then, changes to Spanish zoning laws would have essentially forced it to become commercial some years later no matter what.   The whole thing is just such a nothing thing, with tons of misinformation.  EDIT: Did some research just to see if I could find some more information regarding the old Real Madrid training ground, and found a interesting image. [Here](https://static.s123-cdn-static-d.com/uploads/2649238/normal_62af3fceb8986.jpg) you can see an image from about where Santiago Bernabeu is (bottom right of the picture), and the red square is where the old Real Madrid traning ground was around 1960. Now if you go to google maps to the Santiago Bernabeu and do the whole 3d thing, and look about north following the same road. You can see where the Cuatro Torres Business Area is (the 5 skyskrapers you can see), that is where the old traning ground was. And then you possibly can understand why Real Madrid got so much for it, and why it would honestly be weird not to re-zone it just to have some private grass training grounds. Totally comparable to nation-state clubs. Their pull is the biggest in football so it makes sense but it's not like this is impossible for other big clubs, they can do this to smaller clubs and have done it all the time. It's a food chain and the biggest fish is Madrid. No clubs sign free agents? The shit you read here everyday is something elese To be fair, everyone expected Bellingham to go for close to 150, specially after Chelsea inflated the market, and he only when for 103+30 because, allegedly, he only wanted Madrid >everyone knows they are more than able to compete on transfer fees with those clubs  Yes and no. Chelsea and City can afford to expend 1000m whenever they feel like. No consequences if most of those transfers flop.  Real Madrid is a fan owned club. If they sign several 120M flops in a row, they'll end like Barça. There's no infinite money loop, extra cash can only come from player sales or selling future income. So going into debt.  Chelsea, City or PSG arent limited by their income, just by how much their overlords are willing to expend.  Same for Liverpool, United or any english club. If you dont have more money is because your owners dont want to invest more. I think the issue is there is an additional layer of preventions in the premier league which prevent people from flooding money into the club which seems to be this theory people have. As an NUFC fan our owners can’t sponsor anything, put their own money into the club for players etc. and all of our deals have to be signed off as fair value. (Seems easier in Spain with Barca pulling levers than it does in the EPL).   So this oh they have lots of cash and we have to do stuff for it that others don’t isn’t true. If this was true why did we have to go and play Spurs 3 days after the season finished for extra income into the club? I think Real Madrid simply just need to sign someone and then will sell a crazy amount of shirts and will be able to balance their books; my guess is the Mbappe signing will make Madrid enough to balance him on the PSR accounting books for this season.   Its not really a selling point that you can’t compete with state owned clubs when you’re dominating the Europe, getting Mbappe to leave for no fee, and managing to get the champions league changed into the super league format for more money and games for the top clubs. If the restrictions ever get lifted then I think you might have a case but as it stands you are in the most advantageous position in Europe to maintain your hold on income and players. Even if he’s on a reasonable salary at Madrid, PSG has Mbappe’s wages off the books and he was earning an obscene amount See that’s what I am saying you’re absolutely true that we’re in a very good position that is correct, as I said the management thinks about the future not today but the future, the fans can rejoice today as much they can, but the planning doesn’t stop, it’s a business the reason you see Madrid being run so well is the plain fact they think ahead of the time and not like the peeps in here who act like Pikachu when Madrid does what it does. Perez have been building this project for a long time and now its almost complete and set for another decade ofc players want to join. Everyone wants to be part of this exciting project.  However, Perez set rules that seems to be working really well. 1) either generational talent that he is will to spend on.2) Established player in last year in contract or free.   I do like Wirtz, but I have to see how the team plays with this season. As much as I value him, I don't know where he would play and who would be benched.  As much as I want our bench to be stacked, I also want to see great talent play so I can enjoy the beauty. We even managed to snatch Joselu Fair enough! I don't know why I got downvoted haha, I used the exact same language that came up on the news reports. Definitely not a done deal yet but wow that would be insane for you But it would be fun. You won too much, it's time to enjoy scoring 6 goals a match Especially since he slowed down a lot in the later parts of that season, altough the whole of frankfurt did. Jovic, Haller, Andre Silva, Kolo Muani. Beware of spending big money on Eintracht Frankfurt strikers 1 game wonder We paid 100m for a 0 year wonder Better G/A record than Antony tho He joined Frankfurt after the world cup. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Frankfurt signed him after his performance in the world cup. Between him and Wilson they basically add up to one striker worth through the season. He isn't, he was injured but it's the same recurring issue, groin injury. Once he had surgery he started every game for Newcastle The eye test makes him worth it. I remember when United signed him, I thought Atalanta had fleeced another club for one of their over performing players. Then I watched Hojlund play, and thought ""oh I really hope they don't fuck him up, because he looks rapid"". There was never a club able to meet the asking price cos he was deliberately priced out of the market because he was an essential player, made more expensive every season. That's what he had the €50m release in this most recent contract put in.  You're right, he was a professional and that made staying easier, plus he didn't want to leave for football reasons. But this whole everyone is free to leave if they want to at City thing is overstated. > If someone wants to go they do not force them to stay.  Define force? They're not going to let major assets leave on a free, are they? They expect a fee which only a few can afford. If Bernardo was free to leave he would have gone but he needs someone to pay the fee. And what makes you think that Julian will press it? Yeah Bernardo would prefer a move away, but if no one wants to pay the troll toll..... Lol that release clause is in there because Bernardo wouldn't sign a deal without it. Same reason why the contract was only for 3 years. Possibly he was with Pep from the start, but he wasn't a consistant starter in his final season and the tactics evolved beyond having a pacy right footer on the right and Sterling wasn't as effective in other positions.  Tbh he was never as good once Sane left, those two worked very well and Stirling got a lot of tap ins at the back post andvice versa. If he was that good, he'd be getting more minutes Yeah so explain how he's better 🤔 Considering he was playing the KDB role for a lot of last season, 11 goals and 9 assists isn't too shabby.  Do you think he's a good striker? 11 goals and 8 assists. he also played a significant number of games as a midfielder while KDB was out. his shot numbers aren't great for a forward but they're eye-popping for a midfielder and great for an attacking mid/winger. Started:  away at Arsenal (Grealish on the bench)  away at Manchester United (Kovacic on the bench)  away at Chelsea (Kovacic on the bench)  away at Liverpool (no other option on the bench)  home vs Spurs (Kovacic and Grealish on the bench)  the only games he didn't start:  away at Bournemouth  home vs Manchester United  home vs Wolves  away at Fulham  away at Spurs  idk, hard to say a guy who started 31 games and played 2600 minutes is a rotation option.  edit: grammar. I mean we have the money and would definitely splurge on a top ST right now. The only thing holding us back is not wanting to take crazy inflated prices out of principle. Pool and Chelsea probably could and would join that race too. Didnt Mount go for like 60M last year. Hojlind for 70M, Mudryk for 90M or so, etc.. The market is still inflated imo. The realistic figure is what the actual seller and the buyer agree on lol, that's literally the reality, what Reddit commenters feel in the wind because being completely unrelated to the business they just feel some number feels good or not is the opposite of ""realistic"". Absolute nonsense what you’re saying here, based on absolutely nothing. Especially for the strikers market That’s one match. We judging the entirety of a players quality on one match here? >The alternative is playing inferior players like sane or gnabry  Wtf are you serious ?😐 Did I say you said that? I’m asking you >That Lewa would be a starter since Flick is here at least this season.  oh yeah, that's what I meant when I mentioned roque too I'm sure PSG are interested, what I meant was I don't give much credit to Bernardo feeling the same way. It seemed to be Barca or nowhere for him. It’s not a personal opinion mate. It’s common sense. Latin America is always going to be closer culturally to Spain than England for obvious reasons and the English league has no history with regards to Latin American players at all for that reason. People in Latin America grow up looking at La Liga and many travel to Spain to try out for Spanish clubs, including Julian Alvarez who even tried out for Real Madrid as a child. Further, all the Latin Americans who have played in the PL have only done so in recent times whereas some of Real Madrid and Barcelona’s greatest legends are Latin American. The fact that Julian would apparently “like a Real Madrid move” now even though it’s impossible at this point is frankly telling. Real Madrid just didn’t want Julian enough back in the day whereas City did. If they actually did, City stood no chance—I think Pep’s pull is a bit overstated.  I agree with you but in the context of player ambitions they really aren't much different. Clearly the City project is on the same level as Madrid from a footballing and financial perspective or they wouldn't be signing the best players every year and keeping their existing stars. Do you really think players are viewing City as a stepping stone to get dream moves elsewhere?  From a romanticized historical perspective, they're obviously below most teams, I just doubt most modern players care that much about it unless they were boyhood fans of Madrid or something Subscribed financially yeah. but they're not used to being disappointed and refused. this will embarrass them. and watch them somehow go further in the UCL next season lol. reading this sub it always sounds like doom and gloom for PSG, their players don't want to play for them, their manager wants to quit, their fans hate the players, their board doesn't know how to read Messi's last contract was 4 years, €555m gross salary, €115m signing bonus, €77m loyalty bonus. Not sure if he earned the loyalty bonus, but the salary and signing bonus would have been €168m gross per year or about €84m net. There would probably be some other differences around variable pay and image rights. I think Ronaldo was never at that salary while at Madrid. I think that's what he requested, but he never got past 21 millions. I could be wrong though, it's been some years. It was a rebuttal to this:   ""They're making it on their own terms and because of their own success. It really is of their own doing. Not the league and its inept leaders and the shitty TV deals, not the nation state cash flooding in whenever needed, etc.  In terms of that, they ARE the underdog.""  Which is a load of shit, as evidenced by the article provided. They aren't at the level of a nation state run club, but let's not pretend they've done it all without any help.  As a Barca fan, I envy a lot of what RM have done, but to say they've done it all on their own and are some kind of underdog is a complete load of horseshit. Aptly put. Top of the chain, right now. It's not only about the pull. Football players normally move to a club that pays more wages, and that's expected which isn't out of line. Have you ever heard in the history of football where a player moves on for free and also agrees to play at reduced wages? And he is supposed to be the best player in the world? This is abnormal, this shouldn't happen but it's happening. lol intentionally misconstruing what he said so you can feel like the underdogs. Yes no other club can sign Mbappe on a free, which is a huge advantage competitively And thats every player in the world, when RM comes knocking that player will only want RM. >Yes and no. Chelsea and City can afford to expend 1000m whenever they feel like. No consequences if most of those transfers flop.  Not true with FFP (for the record I think FFP is a good thing).   And (like man united) Real Madrid's revenue means they can spend like these clubs AND THEY DO. Football finance is more than just transfer fees, wages are the most important and you have the second highest in world football Careful, City are going to sue you for discrimination for talking like this!  TBF, Man Utd are pretty much able to spend endlessly too somehow, just not on roof repairs... >There's no infinite money loop, extra cash can only come from player sales or selling future income. So going into debt.  This is true of every club other than City, PSG and Newcastle. LFC and United's owners don't invest anything. Their money comes from the popularity of the PL globally. If anything, Real Madrid's ownership is beneficial as they aren't paying dividends like United or being leveraged to buy other sports franchises like LFC who refuse to spend or take on any debt as a result. > does what it does  I don't understand what this means. Like getting Mbappe on a free? I wonder just how much would be different now if it weren’t for the miraculous run in the champions league in 2022, it seems that afterwards pretty much every single player alive wanted to join real  Not that madrid were struggling with signings before but, if the team was still in the same pit as they were after Ronaldo left and vini, rodrygo and benzema hadn’t stepped up, how different would things be? Yes would be insane but also would be insanely hard to command imo. Can't see a player who can be sacrificed to accommodate him in the current squad. But Real indeed needs more creativity after Modric and Kroos. Good old Mourinho days where we'd concede in the first 20 minutes and go on to win 1:6 every other league game Lol yeah, it would be fun.  But which club fans get tired of winning. Yes we want our 16th }⁠:⁠‑⁠) Don't put Haller there. He was good at Ajax after Frankfurt and literally set CL goal scoring records. He hasn't been great at Dortmund because of having cancer, but still scored the winning goal in the Africa Cup final earlier this year. Any sundayliga player really  Their quality is so bad accross the league, barring 2-3 teams, any random attacker looks like the next big thing there. Cool This isn't true at all. He signed with Frankfurt before the World Cup. It was his form at Frankfurt that led to his call-up for France. No he didn't. He signed his contract with Frankfurt in March 2022, joined them in the Summer of 2022. The World Cup wasn't until November of 2022 Crazy take. He is a £80m player with a £50m release clause. Mate if he wanted to leave they would have found an agreement, it’s extremely simple stuff.  It was widely reported that whilst he would have liked to leave he didn’t care that much. City do not price players out of moves, same as Bayern, Chelsea, etc I never said he would Just thought it was funny you cited Alvarez's goals scoring record as if it was a bad thing when we are comparing to someone with the same goal scoring record.    Not sure what the relevance was there ? he's a very good striker and second striker of course I do. Honestly though he'd be perfect. if we sell Richarlison to help with the fee I'd love Alvarez up top. Mudryk went for £62+bonuses that likely have not been achieved yet.  Still wildly inflated, but not 90. I was responding to   > every time he plays  But also, I’ve watched him play several times and he’s had no effect. He’s over rated because he’s at City You don't think Julian is a much better player right now? Sane has one goal since like October. And gnabry is past it. >Did I say you said that?  You implied it I'm not a fool   To answer that ""question "" havertz has proven more in europe, yet 65 mil at the time, looked ridiculous Oh. Then misunderstanding from my part.  But tbh, I don't think Roque would be a starter like that at Barca. I never felt he was a Barca type of player. So if Barca plays with the Barca system, he might be affected with his current style. You make all valid points and I respect your opinion City is hanging by a thread called pep guardiola and there’s no guarantee what will happen once he leaves the club. No matter what happens at real, the club will always be the biggest. There’s not much comparing the two in my perspective Fair enough. Not saying City isn't an attractive destination.to players that would be dumb.   >in the context of player ambitions they really aren't much different  Imho Guardiola (and money) is 99% of City pull. But we can agree to disagree. I understand that, my comment is in rebuttal to falsely equating clubs backed by funds provided by nation states who are literally non-democratic to shady business deals more than two decades ago.  Totally understand that it's delusional to think Real is an underdog, but to say we're just as bad as an oil club? Too far. Mbappe is going to get a better image right deal than other players for Madrid, his wages is lower sure but his signing bonus makes up for that. It's not abnormal when you consider PSG sporting and media presence is way below Madrid, he benefits too from coming to the club. What's abnormal that something like this didn't happen sooner, you had actual governments like France and Qatar trying to keep him from going, a player can choose to play for a reduced wage and for any club he wants.  A reduced wage at Madrid is still a massive amount of money, he isn't playing for free and certainly will make way more at Madrid by increasing his recognition and sponsorship deals. how did I misconstrue what he said? in recent years madrid signed alaba, rudiger and mbappe for free. a lot of clubs could sign mbappe  but he wanted madrid >Not true with FFP (for the record I think FFP is a good thing).  FFP didnt stop Barça from having a 1K million net debt. Chelsea or City just cant wait a few seasons and invest again. They dont care about debt.  >Real Madrid's revenue means they can spend like these clubs AND THEY DO  Are you missing my point on purpose? Of course Real can and will use their finantial muscle to sign players.  What im saying is Real Madrid has to be accountable with their expending because cant rebound from mistakes just opening the cash flow over and over.  Fan owned clubs cant just print money. Not that hard to understand. Is it Madrid’s fault to get Mbappe for free when we did actually offer 200 to PSG? Is it Madrid’s fault that the player wants to get the signing bonus for himself rather than giving it to his club? You want Madrid to take a high road to please other people and reject Mbappe when he wants to come here and mind you who is arguably one of the if not the best player in the world right now? If he's willing to be an impact sub / rotational player you guys are set Clearly Bayern West Ham paid 50m for him and he wasn‘t good. He was better for Ajax in a weaker league and 11 goals in 8 games in the CL were quite an accomplishment, but 8 of those goals were against Sporting and Besiktas (the other 3 were 2x Dortmund and 1x Benfica) which is still great but it‘s not like he slayed European giants. You can literally look at the other Manchester team...  Haaland, Gundogan, KdB, Gvardiol, Akanji... Dumb ass Maybe don't buy good players from them and let them go to hell under bad management Okay, then I stand to be corrected. Omfg why are people stating that like it was CITY who wanted to insert that and not Bernardo, whose deal was expiring in two years and had all the bargaining power. Are you suggesting that City only wanted Bernardo for three seasons as well?  They got an extra season from him and who knows they might get another. They put a £50m release clause in Bernardo’s contract this time, so to be fair it does look like he wants to leave (city wouldn’t put it in unless he demanded it) and £50m is considerably less than was being asked for him last summer and the summer before. Nah, the guy said alvarez is much better 🤣 which just isn't true Ok fair enough. I thought you were asking the question sarcastically! If it ends up going to another prem club I would easily bet he is going to be in the top 3 goalscorers in his first season. Alvarez has 11 pl goals the whole season, gnabry worst season numbers are on per with alvarez   Sane is just having a poor season he'll be back to his best in no time But now you’d say it is worth it? After the season he had?   If that’s the case then why is Alvarez any different lol. Proven in Europe, treble winner and an instrumental part of Argentina’s World Cup win. He benched Lautaro and helped unlocked messi in that tournament.   There’s a reason Transfermarkt has him valued at 90M €. Idk man he has not played enough to know anything about him All they said was ""They have the Spanish government helping them though.""  I didn't interpret that as equating it to nation state clubs, but only OP knows what they really meant.  Anyway, we're on the same page. Madrid have done well for themselves, but calling them underdogs is delusional.   Oh, and fuck you! ¡Visca Barca!  We'll have money to buy the refs again soon enough! I don't think he is going to earn as much as he earned in PSG, while he gets 80% of the image rights. He earned almost 1.5mil/w in PSG and 80mil loyalty bonus also 100% of image rights. Only Saudi would pay more than that. For Real he is getting 100m over 5 years and obviously less salary than 1m/w. He is going for Glory no doubt and also for better PR and ballon d'or, basically an investment for long term benefits but definitely making less money >how did I misconstrue what he said?  >but he wanted madrid lol yeah just casually sign multiple world class players in their prime on frees, every other club is totally doing that This is the kind of brain-dead idiocy we have to deal with. You signed the best player in the world for free. Do you even understand what that means? Have you ever heard of a free signing where the player reduced his wages to join another club? Do you realize how insane that is? Imagine Haaland, who is currently earning around £800k a week, running out his contract to sign for a club for free and reducing his wages to £100k a week. This is the kind of nonsense Real Madrid pulls!  You know what's worse? Madrid is asking Leny Yoro not to sign an extension so he can move to Madrid for free. Do you understand how bad this is for a club like Lille? They're a small club with a world-class CB prospect, and they can't sell him and make money because your club asked him not to sign a contract. It's like being the world's richest person and stealing food from a beggar. Any club with dignity would pay, but not Madrid. They act like it's their God-given right. The arrogance and entitlement of this club and its fanbase are astounding, especially when they pretend to be underdogs. But FFP means other clubs can't print money. That's the whole point it ties you to your revenue just like real Madrid are lol, no - no one is trying to shame RMA for being blessed. That's how things have turned out. You are some lucky, lucky bastards to be in such a glorious position. Clubs are stupid to not take advantage of what they can - who is going to turn down Mbappe on reasonable terms? No one.  Personally, I wish things were more equal - I wish Chelsea couldn't play around with money like they do, but I'm not going to cry too much about it... I was a supporter before Roman came, and I never liked the idea of dirty money, but the club has mostly followed the rules. I wish they'd close these loopholes...   But what can be done about RMA? How are we going to stop players wanting to play there? Or you having the biggest stadium, most fans, etc. It's just the state of things, and all we can do is envy your riches.  Anyone who's crying about it should choose another sport or league. Yeah.  But I don't want that to happen tbh. Wirtz is a generational talent and he should have great progress. Context though, they were talking about one year wonders. When you set a new CL record at another club in another season and tie a few other records, you're not a one year wonder any more. This 👆 was genuinely curious. Apparently he played over 2k minutes as well so Pep seems to rate him highly. Maybe he leaves when Peps gone 19 goals and 13 assist in total while not playing that much in his main position because his competition is fucking haaland are great numbers.  Havertz has had a really good season and played 500 more minutes, and he had 14 goals and 7 assists in total.   Sane had 10 goals and 13 assists. Gnabry barely played and had 5 goals and 2 assists. He has been subpar for a while.  Julian would be an upgrade over any of them. Arsenal should try to get him. I'm not even from Argentina or a city fan, but he's a great player. >But now you’d say it is worth it?  Same way I say pepê was not. What is this comparison lmao  >helped unlocked messi in that tournament  What is this nonsense 😒 I am not saying from his days here but from his days in Brazil.   That can definitely change. But it was a weird move tbh. so player want to go to a club, he goes there, ""NO OTHER CLUB CAN SIGN PLAYERS FOR FREE"". yeah I'm out  Gundogan or aguero go to barca for free, brainiac on reddit ""no other club could have done it!"" pirlo, ibra, campbell, lewandowski, pogba, llorente, luis enrique even. totally not other club can sign good players for free. you are literally few google searches away from realizing how stupid you are Already got a brainrot I see, can imagine anything else from [moron like you](https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/max_2600x2600/public/images-story/000_9PU9VL.jpg?itok=Z0pbJv6s), why would a free agent got a reduced wages, it's the whole point of free agency, madrid offered 200m to psg for mbappe 2 years ago, maybe wait for yoro saga to unfold before throwing any stones based of some gossips from Spanish press? Great analogy with haaland, Borussia got 60m and his dad got 100m under the table, totally normal stuff. Your vomit that you produced just killed some of my braincells, piss off glueater That is a fair take, my only issue is the fact that people act all surprised, when RMA talks about how they'll compete in the future. Ok, he‘s not a „one season wonder“ but just „not good enough for the highest level“ if you prefer that. But the gist of it stays the same: enjoy Frankfurt strikers with care. A big reason he got so many minutes this season was because of the injuries to KDB and Haaland, and he played very well mostly. As soon as both were back fully fit, he was on the bench again though. That can't feel too good. Didn't know gnabry was that bad 💀 but he doesn't even start plus he doesn't even start   Alvarez would get minutes at bayern but he isn't displacing any of kane,sane or coman yet Did you even watch the World Cup? Lautaro had no work rate so the pairing of Messi and lautaro had zero high press. Benching lautaro and bringing in Alvarez’ work rate and high press helped relieve pressure off messi from having to run. Go watch some tactics videos on YouTube. It’ll help you understand how wrong you are about Alvarez lmao It was an attempt at a counter to endrick .we should start him in preseason pirlo transferred at like 32 for juve, Ibra at 34 for united, Pogba was never world class when he went on frees both times. Which Llorente are you even talking about? Fernando? once again never even near world class. The only valid case you've made is for Lewa and that's a single transfer for a single club. You can't even understand the argument moron learn some reading comprehension before engaging in it Years of inbreeding would lead to this kind of ignorance. Do you even understand the difference between transfer fees and wages? Mbappe was earning more at PSG than he will at Real Madrid, even though he moved for free and still collects 20% of his earnings from personal sponsors. You're the king of the hill, everyone wants to knock you off. It's fine to fret over the details of how you'll stay on top, but otherwise, just swing away at the attackers.   I think the disconnect here is that no one outside of Madrid thinks that RMA is headed for a decilne. We think you're getting the best player in the world for this season, and then you're getting Xabi as your manager next season. You've got Guler and a top academy, and all the veteran players will want to come play there.  Just accept that you're king of the hill and don't be surprised that everyone is coming for the crown. Coman played 27 games this season. He would play over coman and sane for sure. Alvarez was good, but aside from guardiola, no one improves Messi Yeah. It seemed like a Deco move rather than a Xavi move from day 1.  But things can change with Flick. Lets see.  And he needs more games if he need to break into NT. With 3 goals in the last 3 games (and a record just behind pele himself), Endrick got a massive boost. Dude was given the number 9 of Brazil at 17 bruh. Pogba was never a world class, why I am even wasting time arguing with clueless cumblast. Alaba and Rudi were also 29-30 years old and pirlo went to win scudetto 4 times in a row. Oh and let's ignore the fact that Madrid offered 200m to psg for mbappe 2 years ago.   https://www.transfermarkt.com/the-50-best-free-transfers-in-the-21st-century/index/galerie/1077  First Google search since it's slightly too hard for your intelectual prowess. I refuse to believe you weren't dropped on your head as a baby, you make absolutely zero sense. Read again the vomit that your ""brain"" created. For a sake of human beings don't reproduce mate. Definitely, I also feel it's important in modern football to just keep going for the throne, because as long as you stay there, the more influence you have on the next generation of upcoming footballers who will grow up idolising you and in turn would want to play in your club, this is the reason Madrid frets over being at the top as much as they do, they do realise how important it is to stay at the top no matter what, I mean look at Manchester United, they still are one of the greatest clubs because of their history but imagine what would happen few years down the line when the current batch of youngsters would grow up thinking Manchester United are a meme club and who would even want to play there, it's natural things like these happen. Bro, alvarez is not that guy. wtf   Why are you comparing him with players who have proven alot in europe for over 10 years? You overrate the guy It’s improving the system that gets the most out of Messi that helps win a World Cup. Please go read a book Endrick looks really good.for now the only thing i liked a lot about roque is his constant pressing Pogba wasn't even playing when he was healthy before he left United this time. He certainly wasn't world class when Juve got him the first time back in 2012. Once again your reading comprehension is dire I said he wasn't world class both times he transferred on a free in 2012 and 2022. Pirlo also played 3 full seasons worth of games with Juve and then went on a free to the MLS. Which Juve would anticipate since they were getting a 32 year old. Still a good transfer since pirlo was a great player, but 30 something year olds have next to no sale value and Pirlo started 12 matches the season before he transferred to Juve. Madrid is the only team in the world getting world class free transfers in their primes year after year. And no other team offered 200M for mbappe because it was common knowledge he would only go to Madrid anyways It's so difficult to have a conversation with someone who is brain dead, just look at your downvotes, if you still think you are correct, then there is no hope for you. Just please consider euthanizing yourself for the sake of humanity! Yep. 3 years ago, we were the top club in the world and had the world at our feet... but a couple of poor moves (Lukaku, letting our CBs go to Espana) and then the sanctions, and now we're far away from challenging for the league and regularly hear that a player or manager would prefer another club... oh well, it's also fun rising up like a phoenix! You're comparing a great young and proven player to players that are past it. Any Bayern fan will swap Julian for sane, coman or gnabry. Alvarez never unlocked messi, but okay 👍 Yeah. Endrick looks the better player now but he also has an insane PR (which is normal for a highly talented player too).  Messinho also seems good and reports say he has a ceiling equal to Endrick but he seems to be going to Chelsea. Coman is 26. Alvarez is 24   >Any Bayern fan will swap Julian for sane, coman or gnabry.  That's why they don't run the club. 70 million should be dropped on a world class striker, not a good one Coman is 27 and usually doesn't play over 2000 minutes per season. Let's be realistic. Arsenal dropped that much for havertz and he's not world class. Julian is a better player and with actual potential to be world class Alvarez is not better than havertz   >Coman is 27 and usually doesn't play over 2000 minutes  Bcz of injuries not because he's not good enough He's a great player, but availability is important. Don't you wish Gabriel Jesus was healthier this season? Well coman has played a similar amount of minutes for the past 3-4 seasons > Alvarez is not better than havertz   lol you have no clue Bro, stop attacking my flair, Jesus Just because you overrated him doesn't mean he's that guy"
"[Simon Stone]Fee agreed for Julian Alvarez. Up to €95m (€70m + €25m in add-ons. Personal terms still to be agreed. Would be record sale for @ManCity.

Must be nice. Wow Didnt know Atletico is so rich wtf Goodbye Juli. Immense potential. I would say Julian is a kind of player that is not rated properly. Some would say he is overrated and some underrated. This spell with Atleti will sway opinion of many for him.  IMO he can easily get 20+ goals for them. The best attribute of him for me is his pressing. Man just doesn’t stop. Happy he is leaving City. It will be hard for them to replace his 31G/A(I think) for a player that doesn’t even play his natural position. People here complaining about the price and me thinking 70M for a young PROVEN player that is as good as Julian is a good deal or maybe even on the cheap side. Those add ons better be achievable ones.  But maybe that's just because I am a Benfica fan. Hopefully we can buy decent cover for rodri with this.  Back to Foden/Bernardo false 9 when Haalands out, no problem. Reporting the sale price in € then comparing that to the pound price is kinda odd  Still a crazy price tho City have taken Atletico to cleaners. Just like they did with Barcelona for Ferran Torres. [removed] Amazing deal for City, they get big money for him and don't sell him to a direct rival. He has all the characteristics to destroy under Simeone. I have high hopes for him. I feel like he'll immediately put Atleti in title contention, wonderful player. - Can score goals   - Can create as many goals as he scores   - Presses like crazy   - Won literally everything you can  No clue why people are acting like they're getting taken to the cleaners. He's a cracking player and a great buy for anyone.   I was taken back by Atleti had so much to spend, but I can't say I follow La Liga closely. He'll be better than Felix, that's for sure.  Huge amount of actually legitimate profit for City.  Feels like one of those deals that's win, win around. Alverez doesn't deserve to be second fiddle to anyone, IMO. the amount of people saying this is some huge overlay are crazy. Julian Alvarez is a class CF and any team on the planet would be lucky to have him Fucking hell. He's good but not that good. City have taken Atletico to the cleaners. City's sales in the past few seasons have been fucking ridiculous, done so well here again curious to see what City spend the money on. Rodri backup? People gonna be surprised how much this guy will tear up La Liga The reverse Aguero Fee agreed ... with which club? Ath Madrid?   Not mentioned in the tweet Incredible business from city Holy rip off Have City been linked with a replacement yet? Or does it look like they'll give more minutes to players they already have rather than sign someone? As a Man City fan, I'm sad to see Alvarez leave but he's good enough to be a nailed-on starter for a Champions League level team and he would never get that at Man City.  Atletico should be a great fit for him, as I see him as an upgrade over Alvaro Morata in terms of what he would bring to the team.  He might also surprise everyone and take on that Griezmann role.  He has a high ceiling for what he can do under Simeone.  Between Bobb, Savio, and McAtee I'm not sure City will need to sign a true replacement.  I think there's decent cover throughout the squad for the forward positions.  I really think City need another midfielder, especially as it appears that Kalvin Phillips will be playing this season as a centerback. Shows how hard it is to win the league, if City’s second choice striker is worth 95m  Fair play to them for signing him for such a low price though 25m in add-ons seems like a massive amount Where is Atleti getting this money?? crazy atletico splashing the cash 😮 €95m is wild, but what a signing for them. can’t wait to see how he does leading the line for a top team That's such a crazy price for him my god. He is a good player but not 100m. More like 60-70m. Paid ""£14m"" for him two years ago. Call me bias but I think its insane that he was sold for less than €100m. If any of the big clubs were in need of a striker they would've blown way past that.      The striker market is still the worst its ever been (yes Alvarez is best at SS but he's still great as a no.9), he's just 24, proven winner, and most of all his work rate is absolutely perfect for a modern pressing style. Højlund, Havertz, Kolo Muani all went for €75m, Núñez €80m. Don't tell me these were ""overpays"", that's literally just the price for a decent forward these days.      I'll stand by this is being an absolute bargain and he'll be a star in that system. he's a baller im glad they're selling him lol a terror This feels like Joao Felix all over again, they get money and then just get instantly ripped off. *Sad noises* 😭 Txiki finally didn't get scammed That’s a crazy fee, not sure how city pulled that off. If you’d have said 50M you still say that was a decent price. I dreamt of Julian going to barca, this makes me so sad Absolute madness. I'm so happy to be able to watch him go up against Barca and Real Madrid, LA Liga is going to be a great competition this year! Damn txiki usually gets cleaned when we are selling, but this time he's cooked! A great deal for us, atleti and the spider! All the best in Spain and I hope you cook rm and barca That’s an insane price Should have been Kevin’s replacement imo. Why mix pounds and euros? Now I need to do maths to know the difference between buy price and sell price. am I the only one who finds this transfer fee to be absurdly high? I would understand if its 50-60 millions but paying almost a hundred is some crazy shit. He is a good player but he played in the city system and we all know how that usually pans out. Also, he didnt put up any crazy numbers or anything to justify the price. It really reminds me of Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal transfer, but that was still a much smaller fee, and while I get that Atletico is going hard with investing this summer, this seems like a waste of money That's amazing value for city! Oh now I get why they didn't want to pay up for hancko. They were too busy getting ripped off by city I love when they use euros for selling to look more and pounds for buying to look less. This feels short-sighted. Should have moved KDB on and built with Julian. Wow City really got paid here City should sign Olmo, my unbiased opinion  I don't give a fuck what anyone says, but as good as Julián Álvarez is (and he really is good), he's not worth £82m. They've absolutely had Atlético's pants down here. I love it how the number City bought him for is in pounds so the smaller number is shown and the number that he is being sold for is in euros do they numbers are higher. As said yesterday, this is a crazy overpay. Sinking so much into one player for a team like Atleti is not good. Hopefully we can keep Haaland for 3+ more years Something suspicious about this transfer. I bet Athletico sells some unknown players to City for huge fees in this or the next transfer window. Made multiple comments on this already but every time i see the fee the weirder it looks. He is not worth that. The price is so high it feels shady. Not an expert on Atleti hut surely spreading that money around would be better for the team? What is atletico doing 💀 Anyone else find it odd how media outlets keep mentioning how much Man City bought him for lol. This is insanity Who in their right mind doesn't think he's worth that price lol I‘m pretty sure this is some money laundering inside trade I dont think Julian is *all* that good. I would definitely take this deal if I was City at this price. Is a useful squad player though so will be interesting what happens. Wonder who they replace him with or if they think/feel they have a replacement already at the club. Dont watch enough AM to comment on his fit and potential role, but strictly financially this feels like an overpay to me. He's a great player obviously but that is a mental amount of money tbh, wow Is that a fair price for him?  Shouldn't it be around 50mill? ManCity have an impressive track record buying central strikers ( quality and price). They could make a 150M profits on Haaland. 95 mil for alvarez? He's a good player, but I think the number of trophies he's won has far overrated him When will it be our turn to commit daylight robbery :( What a good deal for Atleti ffs. Incredible player at a cut-price Call me mad, but although Felix has not been able (or didn't make any effort) to show his potential, he is a good player and I think it would be interesting for City to include him on this deal. [deleted] You think Atletico is poor then sudenly they over spend 100 mil on some player Nice buy.  Considering all their spendings these weeks, my predictions is for them to finish 4th. Atletico think they’re Chelsea with this blatant overpaying ffs That's too much Fucking hate how city have unlimited amount of money and yet they still manage to scam other clubs. As a united fan I feel we get fucked by every club on transfer caus people wont let us have 1 penny more. Yet they give War chests to city... So Julian will be playing next to another big Norwegian, Sørloth (whos even taller) He's a great player, but this is an overpay.  Compare this to how much Jadon Sancho went for couple years ago and he was younger and far more accomplished. Am I the only one that thinks this dude is mid as fuck? Atletico getting scammed again but this time by a rich man Don't worry. Someone will distroy his joy of football playing in the first season That’s overspending regardless of how you look at it. He’s the one that desperately wants to leave and have game time so technically buying clubs should have better bargaining leverage.  While I think he has potential, this price tag is absolutely going to weigh him down. Can see him going the way of his overpriced NT teammate Enzo. How does City keep getting away with this? Another Ferran Torres.   Ridiculous fee for a system player. Will he become another Felix? I've never seen someones reputation increase so much from not being able to play because there's a much better player on the team. So insanely jealous. This guy is everything that Arsenal needs right now… but of course City would never have sold him to us anyway. I cannot understand why we didn’t just pony up an extra 40/50 million to get Alvarez He is NOWHERE near, this fee's worth. 60 m total would have been fair What a massive waste of money. Congrats to City for scamming another big Spanish club by selling them a severely overrated player for a ridiculous fee Striker market is nuts. Look what solanke might go for It's surprising that I read so many people think this is an overpay.   Doesn't look like an overpay at all to me, if you consider a large part is add-ons.   I'm a little surprised Atleti have so much money, but the price is more than fair for a player of his quality.   This transfer would've been perfect for Chelsea as well, considering City would've sold to them as they are not a threat. But luckily for all of us, Chelsea is more into paying 20-30 mil for 16 year olds with no senior appearances. It helps when the player they are selling is good. In this market I wouldn’t call 70m a crazy price for a 24 year old World Cup winning striker who has a well rounded game and still scores at a very good rate Not weird at all considering who controls La Liga. [removed] City have criticized for financial cheating. But we are seeing more and more signs they are moving towards becoming financially sustainable. First Cole Palmer, now Alverez. That’s already 90-110m in transfer profit for those two players the last two seasons.  And their jersey sales grew something like 110% YoY.  They are not quite there yet, but they are big steps towards it. And with a lot of ex-Barca from 2003-2010 people on in the management team. They know the drill of how to run a club.  It’s gonna be like Chelsea were people are going to forget with time that the club was bankrolled by someone. No one barely talks about it anymore.  Edit:  A lot of people seem to be triggered. But this is what gonna happened. It happened once, it will happen again. The new generation of football fans will be unaware of the historical context. We have seen it with Juve, Chelsea, and now City. I started following football in 2003, but I have no idea what the football landscape looked like in 90s, 80s, 70s. Other than a few historical highlights you can look up on wiki.  You can be angry about it, be in denial, and downvote all you want, but that is just how it is. Someday, our generation or the generation above us will be gone and nobody or very few will remember. First time City ever played fair, I reckon. Honestly, i don’t even know how I rate Julian Alvarez tbh. He’s a great/ amazing player don’t get me wrong.. but pep/city makes everyone look amazing with his system and playing style. I really couldn’t tell you how he’s going to fit with Diego’s system lol They were able to pay 120M on Joao Felix, around 80 for Lemar  Let's hope it turns out better for them this time idk why so many people are surprised. i guess cuz they don’t consistently spend crazy amounts like PSG and Chelsea. Atleti are a huge club in a major city, they’ve had success recently and they’re managed really well financially for the most part Atleti are really good at developing players so they make a lot of money from selling youngsters and even first team players, say what you want about the club or Simeone but a lot of players go to Atletico and leave way better than they arrived. https://assets.deloitte.com/is/image/deloitte/DFML24-Website-Graphics-v8-3-1?$Responsive$&wid=1200&fmt=webp&fit=stretch,1&dpr=off  They are the 15th highest earning club. Not exactly poor and do have enough for the occasional big signing. Up until a few weeks ago, they had lower net spend than Almería in the last 10 seasons, after qualifying for CL for 14 years in a row if I'm not mistaken Higher ups are just stingy as hell I thought the same thing. My guess is the new stadium helps along with its sponsorship. It will be a lot of installments. Probably like 15-25 mil a season. All good, they'll be able to cover it with the 100m that Girona will pay them for Felix. Seems Chelsea paid up to 50M for Samu, that covers part of it. Kinda bitter but can't be mad at that price tag.  Hopefully it's Bobb's time to shine now! Tbh he's got a bigger and better trophy cabinet than most all-time icons. Seems wierd to talk about the potential of a WC and CL winner. Yea the price is crazy but the market price for young forwards are just crazy in general. Like Darwin Nunez >Immense potential.  Gonna be hilarious when he never looks as good as he did at City across his entire career.  Have we not learnt this lesson with City attackers yet? Honestly guys gotten so many goals playing out of.position. despite lots fo minutes as well. Regardless still a quality player but i dont think hes the complete griezeman replacement. > The best attribute of him for me is his pressing. Man just doesn’t stop.  Thats all you need to know why this player is a 90m€ worth player for Simeone. Yup finally Alvarez will have the stage. He seems a hit or miss for me, sometimes misses easy chances, his first touch was bad when Pep tried to play him in midfield last season. But he got that energy to press all 90 minutes, long passes are good & eye for goal. He will definitely improve. That’s the crazy part, Havertz for the same fee was considered a good transfer after the great season he had of just 21 G/A.   And it’s not a slight on Havertz. Alvarez put up the same stats as Saka (32 vs 34 G/A). Imagine any Arsenal fan stating £60M guaranteed for Saka was a bad deal. And before anyone claims age, Julian is only 1.5 yrs older than Saka. Honestly I don’t think City will have much trouble replacing his G/A. City had no strikers in 20/21 and outscored everyone with midfielders in False 9, Pep will always find a way to score goals I think his biggest problem is he is a jack of all trades but not standout in one. He can play CM, CAM, AM, RW, LW, SS, and striker to a good/very good degree but he is not a blow you away type of a player in away of them. Usually when you get in the 80m+ you have a player who can take over one aspect of the game and he won't do that.   I think this is a fair deal but I can also see how this is an overpay He got 29 G/A last season Good post. His pressing combined with his ability to get goals is brilliant. Plus he has a determination to improve that many young stars leave behind.   However, on the goals, it’s not a like for like situation. Replacing the goals will be simple…. Haaland scores more, KDB is fully fit. Oscar Bobb comes in, Doku improves, Grealish improves his strike rate. He's the Thomas Mueller of strikers. Won everything but doesn't excel at anything, just good at everything. Yet to see if his numbers are just because he was at City because nobody is scared of him when he's on the ball. For 80m that seems like a gross overpay. I think outside of Man City the only Premier League team he doesn't walk into the first 11 of every week is Newcastle because Isak is amazing. You guys are breaking your dicks backwards to justify him not being amazing saying he didnt play his natural position, but the guy came to Europe playing second striker and he played just like that last season. There is another 🇳🇴 Man City set to receive **4.4 trillion Iranian rials** just two years after paying **316 bitcoin** for Julian Alvarez. Any competent team in the transfer market takes us to the cleaners, that's not an achievement. Yeah they're good at selling Im a City fan, Alvarez is levels above Ferran Torres, Atlético are getting a very good player. That's the thing, City is a well drilled and managed team, it makes all their players look amazing. Some of them are of course but you have to imagine there's some that just look good because City's so good. Ferran Torres was incredible. My Barca friend was hyping the man up for god knows what reason.       Alvarez is genuinely quite good and has goals in him. Athletico paid an English price but I think that paid a fair price for his ability and potential. More importantly he’s played quite a bit. We know a decent amount about him. I mean ... how many better strikers of a comparable age are there? Ferran was an overpay but I think the price for Alvarez is actually not that far above his market value. Fun fact that I found quite surprising, Ferran Torres is younger than Julian Alvarez Also Athletico’s biggest problem the last few years has been defending, they still need major upgrades there. Honestly us City fans loved him but you just can't play him ahead of Haaland and he's too good for the bench. A problem most teams would like to have, I know.  He got a decent run playing KDB's role (kinda) last season and as the 9 when Haaland was out, as soon as both were back fit he was back to sitting on the bench.   I'm happy for him and his career too (until Haaland fucks off to the other side of Madrid lol), plus we got more than I expected for him. Wait till we meet ATM in UCL or some shit. These things always happen lol. I wouldn’t be shocked, they’ve had an incredible window on paper. Le Normand, Gallagher, Alvarez, Sorloth and potentially Laporte seems massive La Liga already has the storyline - Barca with a bunch of really good La Masia kids v Real with galacticos and the most stacked team in the world.  We might see Atletico pop in out of nowhere and join that battle. If we get a decent CB now, we are definitely strong in the race, we haven't had team this strong in YEARS, atleast on the paper. He’s a good player but I don’t think he’s that guy, at least not yet Yeah Mbappé or Alvarez, who got the better player?  (I doubt they’ll be in title contention) Great player. Still crazy price tbh. Although just few months ago all clubs were drooling over him whenever he scored for us.   Proven both at club and international level. He's gonna live up to the price tag imo. Very detailed, in-depth analysis. If he can score, surely he worths 90 mil Atletico do have a history of getting taken for cleansers. Diego Costa, Morata and Lemar. Didn’t work with Lukaku though. It’s a big fee but let’s be real, who else is available for a good price? Alvarez is still young, has been good at City and Atleti could easily keep him for a few seasons before selling him for a similar price  They sold Jesus for around half that price, who isn’t as good of a striker and was older at the time. He’s definitely worth it. He’s world class As a Real fan, i would gladly have us pay 100 mil for him if we needed his profile and had the spot free. He's very, very good. He is very good, there’s no better striker on the market available imo especially at his age. He gets them 25 / 30 goals + in all comps next season barring any injuries. He’s built for Spain. I would regard 70m as a good deal for him, and 95m a fair price depending on what it takes to achieve it. Way higher prices has been paid mutiple times for less proven players with lower or equal potential He is though. This is an immense transfer for atleti. They have a habit of randomly overpaying for forwards (yes better than overpaying across the squad before someone tries to attack my flair). Gave us 60 million for Costa when he was chilling on the beach and our coach had publicly told him to f off. And this amount paid was 7 years back! No they haven't. Jesus this fucking thread. Being taken to the cleaners is united spending 170 mil for hojlund and Antony. Paying this for Alvarez is paying a slight premium on a player a club just signed to a new contract and an actual proven player. Without the add-ons, he cost less than Hojlund while being leagues above him. Lol United paid more than 100 mil for Antony and you said that price doesn’t justify? There's a reason why all the other big clubs keep on taking their executives. 115 ofcourse but their selling in last two or three years have been ridiculous. Likely no one this summer, maybe all in on Wirtz or Musiala next year. Such an expensive player would never want to be backup. I guess they will go for KDB's replacement as this season will probably his last Musiala/Wirtz? He won't  Only looks good because plays for City Wdym? This is a steal for Atleti Word on the street is no replacement this season as too much uncertainty around with Pep and charges. Young lads will get more game time which I'm totally on board with personally. Bobb being trusted by the looks I think he could’ve absolutely become nailed on at City under a different manager, one that uses a second striker. Unfortunately for Alvarez, City has Pep who is not one to use such role frequently. And it doesn’t seem like Pep is wanting to go anywhere anytime soon. He has yet to show that he can perform at the elite level as the sole striker of a top team. Saying it is insane to sell for less than 100m a player that has not yet bagged 20+ goals a season as striker and all the challenges it brings is insanity.  He probably will be amazing, but that probably is why he is not worth as much as a player that has proven they can do it. Seems like João Felix was offered in the deal as well. Stay mad 😂 you can keep hancko We still want to sign Hancko, but Feyenord should negotiate. 35-40M€ is too much for a Erividise defender IMO. But the fee is £60m?   If he hits all the objectives then it would absolutely be worth it too Sign the contract big boy  Could see Barrios moving to City tbh. Obviously not this window, but not far into the future No. Why is it odd? when you produce or scout someone good instead of overpaying for mediocrity 95m package isn't a cut price, not even close where the fuck did you get 100m from? It's 70 + bonuses Sancho will never even sniff half the trophies julian already has lmfao Sancho was more accomplished? In what universe? Huh? Which system? River plate? Argentina? City? He's levels above Torres tbf Entirely different player who’s won everything and one Simeone actually asked for himself. I suspect the 30+ g/a he had across all comps last season might have something to do with it It’s pretty clear Julian wants to play in Spain. My man is called VamosLionel but hates anything related to Argentina.   Starting to wonder if the username is ironic? And yet nobody wants a cut price Toney It's not that athleti don't have money. Their owners prefer to be frugal Fully agree. In todays market, talented but not extraordinary young strikers cost a decent amount. Alvarez is very talented, can at least play 2/3 types of positions (9, 10, second striker), has a good shot and decent linkup and technical abilities and works a lot. Not many strikers fulfil that many positive qualities in one. He isnt exceptional in one of them but you put him on the pitch and he mostly performs and helps the team. I'd guess he's a top 10 striker and for many top 5 because of the way he plays I'm not convinced Alvarez is an elite striker so I think this fee is very good for City.  Him and Gallagher under Simeone will be a nightmare though, pressing monsters. why we catching strays like this bruh 😭 This transfer would t have helped Chelsea at all Can't wait for Atleti to ask City to renegotiate the terms next year. Don't understand how this is not an overpayment but Olmo apparently shouldn't be worth 40m€ I think it is an overpay at this point. 60+20 would be fairer. But then, people go for unfair prices all the time. Yeah atleti's record with expensive forwards have been great lol Why's every idiot on the internet an expert on what Chelsea's squad needs and what they should be able to afford? Because its not...you look at his resume and his performances. If this was another club, it'd be 100m+ I'd say it's about what he's worth in the current market. Atleti is paying a substantial fee for a class player. Its an outrageous overpay though How is this perfect for Chelsea? We have Nkunku who operates similar to Alvarez. I rate Nkunku just as highly but Nkunku doesn’t seem to fit the 9 as well since you lose his build up play. Alvarez can play the 9 better but we already have too many players in the starting 11 that aren’t tall enough to defend corners. I think it is an overpay because as good as Alvarez is, this is the sort of fee paid for elite level players. He is excellent but it is always difficult to justify a price tag like this. You have to realize that every time Atleti spends big it turns out to be a massive blunder. Their top 3 most expensive signings are Joao Felix, Lemar and Diego Costa (post Chelsea) and all 3 managed to shit the bed in different ways. >considering City would've sold to them as they are not a threat.  I disagree that we would have sold to Chelsea. We almost got them back on track by selling them one academy player who still hadn't properly broken in to our team lol.  I don't see us giving them Alvarez, we know his quality and how much he would improve them. It's a ridiculous overpay, and he wouldn't have been perfect for Chelsea at this price. He's laughably overrated by people who just look at stats.  There's a reason our board wanted nothing to do with him at these prices It's absolutely an overpay... We're talking nearly 100m here. He's nowhere near that calibre of player and Atleti shouldn't be sinking so much into one player regardless. Who controls La Liga? It’s not weird considering how good the player can be It‘s much easier to achieve that when you can cheat your way to getting that solid foundation and good reputation My God mate, ofc it is easy when you get a great start from financial doping it isn't impressive at all.  You also praise nepobabies for doing well on the millions they get from their parents? This is the first time I’ve ever seen someone describe man city as moving towards becoming financially sustainable!   Also no one has forgotten Chelsea were bankrolled by someone? Nobody argues that they have been above board since around Pep's second year. But they cheated for years before that to get their squad value up to where it is. The last paragraph is revealing. You want people to forget the financial doping, because you know it’s a stain on the legacy.   This is why people shouldn’t (and don’t) take City or Chelsea’s accomplishments as seriously as other winners during this era. Not triggered just honestly can’t believe that someone had this opinion on Man City.   Just because you started following football in 2003, and don’t know what football looked like in 70s,80s and 90s it’s a bit much to say a whole generation will do the same as you. As a liverpool fan I think its great hes moved lol. To be honest I love his work rate and from what I saw (dont watch many city games) he did a good job filling in for de bruyne. He seems to like to take free kicks too which is a plus. With gallagher alongside him it will help free him to be more creative. I see him becoming their Griezmann replacement He works as hard if not harder than Griezmann, hopefully everything clicks for him under simeone Yes because they sold half their team, Griezmann alone was almost enough for Felix transfer.. They bought Diego Costa back for 60m and spent 60m on Morata the year before that. Julian is an amazing footballer but more than that he works hard for the team, he is an asset those of us at City don't want to see go, he is a wonderful human being too.  I think he will elevate AM, a fantastic buy even at this price. If for managed really well you mean being miserable for years and sit on the money, then that's correct. The club has lost value since the last time the board invested real money, and they want to sell the club, right now IIRC we are the 15th club in the world, we reached top5... I guess that is a metric that would bring more money from a posible buyer. This board would never do anything without a long term idea in mind and it's not the same selling below top10 club than dunno, top5.   Still with all these news I don't want to have hope, I'm too old to let this club crush my spirit again. I couldn't name you a recent youth player to save my life from that club. The most recent ""developed player"" I can think of is koke. Which is lower than Dortmund, and their fans never miss an opportunity to tell you how they can't spend big money on signings.... Should be said that this seems to be an outlier for this year aswell. Atleti has been ahead of Inter and Milan for like a decade before that and will probably be ahead of them again for the next one. And longer term Atleti's revenues will keep growing with big infrastructure investments Isn't that how everyone does business these days? Kinda crazy that now both first and second choices for striker in one of the top teams in the world are both Norwegians. Bobb is definitely next off the ranks. Really hoping him and Rico have breakout years this season And 2x Copa America, and 1x Libertadores, and 1 Argie league, and 2 Prems, and an FA Cup.  Its really insane for a 24 year old. He’s won virtually everything he’s played.. no Carabao cup though lol  WC and Treble winner* Still fair to say he has the potential to be a bigger contributor at a top club He's as close as you can possibly get imo [deleted] Im pretty sure they could get Weghorst for a season, have him score 15 goals and then ship him off for 50m to a team he's then poor in. Sterling and Jesus are prime examples so not sure why people think Alvarez will be much different. Dont think he starts for Villa as well. Do you guys play with 2 strikers now? I don't know if you are joking or not. Bayern, Inter, Napoli, Real Madrid, Athletic Club to name a few. Probably wouldn't walk into Bournemouth or Liverpool either.   Tbf I think there are a few teams he doesn't walk into as imo he's not clearly an upgrade on a lot of strikers, Mateta would probably be a strong challenge for Alvarez given his advantage physically and the form he was in at the end of last season Bobb is class ole ole ole ole Can see him being brought into the team this season on the right wing. Same 🤝  - speaking as a man utd fan. We used to be absolutely terrible at it though and I'm talking post takeover. agreed.  I never thought Barca thirsting after Ferran made sense.  Him and Eric Garcia felt like they just wanted to buy Spanish talent.  Julian is different.  He's still young but he's been very very good.  Hope he thrives. how do you put an accent but leave in the ""h""? Yall fleeced them thank you but wtf, how are they that stupid? He ain't worth that much Alvarez has looked very good for Argentina as well. That's...often not true. Palmer never looked closed to as good as he does in chelsea. Nickpicking your comment but this is Atlético not Athletic, mate As an Atleti fan, you’re absolutely right. We’ve been suspect in defense for a while now. These downvotes show that they don’t watch Atleti outside of the occasional UCL match. Hancko with Le Normand was the dream, and we are still needing a CB. Will there be a bite to accompany another hair pull on Grealish That's crazy. Alvarez and Sorloth could be a nasty duo [deleted] Both times Atleti won the title under Simeone, they had worse players than RM. Of course Madrid are favourites, but Atleti aren't to be sniffed at. Madrid have sort of bungled La Liga at times even when they had the best squad in the league.  I'm cautiously optimistic about our chances in the league, but already resigned to them winning another CL. I don't understand how he's this underrated. Given it’s the entire point of the sport, yeah Sorry, I'll type up my full scouting report to reddit! The place where people go for the most detailed analysis. Forgot Felix? Still dumbfounded by that Costa purchase. The man was sitting on his arse frozen out by the manager yet Chelsea got a pretty premium for him. You have to think about it in terms of opportunity cost. 80m euros for Alvarez now means 80m less for any other prospective transfers this window or the next. And in recent history, they've really not spent a lot of money suggesting this is likely a major chunk of their transfer budget.  They've already bought Alexander Sorloth for a not so insignificant 30m and they still have Griezmann and Correa. Is another striker really the number 1 priority compared to other positions? Real have got 100m to spare, tho, so it's whatever. Atleti, don't You can use that argument to justify any price Osimhen is available and probably not for a much bigger transfer fee. I think he's good and versatile but there's a reason he rode the bench in key games. Now he might improve but that's a steep price either way. downvoted for spitting facts lmao I'm gonna guess (and hope) Bruno Guimaraes and/or Wirtz next season RemindMe! 1 year He literally won a World Cup and 2x Copa America back to back.   This subreddit is absolutely fucking clueless, holy shit. Lmao Makes sense, thanks. Has Pep been experimenting with double false 9s in pre-season by any chance? Feels like if Haaland is unavailable at some point during the season you could always revert back to the system you had before Haaland. Most of the players at the club are already familiar with it. To be honest, Alvarez plays his best as a second striker and no top team uses two strikers.  The only ones are Inter and Atletico Madrid, and I think he found the team he should theoretically be a better fit with. >  perform at the elite level as the sole striker of a top team  lmao if he's done that he'd be at 120m+.    >  not yet bagged 20+ goals a season as striker    I don't even know why you brought this up, he's scored 17 goals both years at City as a back up spot or playing out of position. I will flair bet right now he'll bag 20+ at Atletico lol.      Your own Kolo Muani went for €75m, Núñez went for €80m and that was from Benfica. Alvarez has literally proved he's a level above. Acting like he's some unproven project is ridiculous. We will lmao, that's the perfect outcome for us That's the price, that simple. Buy players you can afford, like the rest of us, instead of coming with insulting offers and going for mental games with the players. In this market where scrubs are going for 100m+? It definitely is That's basically 300m if you round up In this universe? The man had almost 100G/A before he even turned 21. The one where Sancho had 4 years of experience including 38 league goals and 45 league assists in a team he was really important to whereas Alvarez has 2 years including 20 goals and 8 assists in a team that doesn't need him at all. His last two seasons at Dortmund before moving United was in this same universe I’m just saying bcoz of price tag, for some reason splashing big money on players doesn’t seem to work for us and you  They don’t fancy the odds Probably the age and the gambling giving him a reputation tbf. Not that he's old but he is older than Solanke. He doesn’t exactly have the best image right now + his age is also an unattractive factor. Tooney is good in transition. He's not that useful for how big clubs play doesnt READ the game well, if at all His playstyle doesn’t suit possession based sides. Most top teams that will pay expensive wages…are possession based. Brentford want £50m for a 28/29 year old - not exactly cheap Didn’t he gamble? Oh yeah they absolutely have money and the last time they spent sky high prices on someone it didnt exactly go down well (Felix) Athleti I didn't mean I'm surprised they have the money for Julian. I meant in the context of all the signings they seem to be making this summer. Atleti definitely aren't that rich. While their owners are tightwads, the likes of Dortmund, Juventus, and both Milan teams all earn higher revenues than Atleti (according to the Deloitte Money League). Their net spend is negative most years. Exactly, Aren’t ateltis owners the richest in the world?  (excluding nation state owners ofc) It'll be interesting to see how he fits in at Atletico Alvarez is going to be what they thought Felix was Is he even a striker, no mind a top 10 striker? He looked like a false 9 when Haaland was out. He's only scored 11 goals while playing a lot of games for City last year (about 1/3 of this was as a striker). I might be wrong but his output was similar to Farren Torres. He's a better player 100%. He isn't a top 10 striker right now. Long way to say he's mid Alvarez was an elite striker before he joined City. He would be worth so much more if Haaland wasn't his main competition at the club. Bruh are you high? you literally paid €75m+10 for Højlund lol Imbeciles want free karma. Even in a thread not involving Chelsea you'll find some dummy mention chelsea negatively with 100+ upvotes. Fuck em this sub is a stupid echo chamber anyway >Why's every idiot on the internet an expert on what Chelsea's squad needs and what they should be able to afford?  This is a legit question in many cases, but not when it comes to Chelsea. Whatever Chelsea's strategy is since the takeover, it's so stupid and bad that the average reddit comment seems to make more sense than what the Chelsea board is doing.   And more specifically on Alvarez, if you get into Maresca's system and how he likes to play tactically, I don't think there is a better striker on the market for him, this summer. I've no reason to defend Atletico or anything, but that's a number of 3. A record comprised of 3 situations is technically anecdotal and has no prediction of the future, statistically. I would argue Arsenal was closer to City when City sold Zinchenko and Jesus, than Chelsea is right now to City, and yet you sold 2 players that were clearly improving Arsenal massively, at the time.   What do you mean you almost got them back on track with Palmer? They were midtable all season and only at the end managed to get some results. It was nowhere near in sight for City to be bothered by them in the slightest. And at the moment there are no signs for Chelsea to be a some sort of problem for City next season either.   I believe Arsenal would be the only club City would not sell to, this summer. I don't think your board really is a valid supporting entity to an argument that talks about inflated transfer prices 😂 Yeah I don't understand why anyone would pay 70 + 25 for Alvarez when the goat Mudryk cost only 70 + 30 !RemindMe 1 year Magneto obviously Lizard people You know...*them* I've no idea, I just thought it was a funny thing to say. [deleted] Immigrants from the boats /s When you look at the history of the current clubs, their foundation is not based on ethical success. I remember Arsenal controversy  https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11661/11564691/how-arsenal-were-voted-into-the-top-flight-over-tottenham-in-1919 It's amazing that Kylie Jennet is s self made billionaire. Replying two times to the same comment within 25 mins and with a hostile attitude. Yup, definitely not triggered…  But even so, you should be triggered because your team is direct competitor to city. And you have a couple more league titles if it weren’t for city. He can play across the forward line and attacking mid, and to be fair hes looked decent in all of these positions. Surely he is a loss to city, their next subs might not be as clinical Yeah, I see him doing really well, I like him as a player and it’s nice to see City weakened. They also pay the fattest salary for a coach in Europe We bought Morata 2 years after Costa This doesnt sound right. Have never seen these figures reported for either of those players, but especially not for a Diego Costa who was clearly past his prime and falling out of favor at Chelsea. Wonderful human being? You don’t know him Pablo Barrios, Roro Riquelme, Garnacho Some of them are De Gea, Bono, Thomas Partey, the Hernández brothers, Koke, Rodri or more recently Rodrigo Riquelme and Pablo Barrios Riquelme is from atletico as is Fernando Torres I believe and Theo hernandez (I'm the least confident on the last one) That's really just German clubs not named Bayern. Leverkusen is also very rich but you'll never see them spend this kind of money. Dortmond choses to not spend big money on signings though, they absolutely can. I was originally just going to state they were a top 10 but thought I should check for a source first. I guess after the Prem big  6, Barca, Madrid and Bayern there’s not that much space in the top 10 left. Makes sense that they’re around the level of Dortmund, and the Italian teams. Most clubs yeah. spanish clubs minus RM are only able to do such deals because of the strict La Liga FFP And yet Norway can't seem to qualify for shit, despite being talented in other areas too. Sleepless nights over that one. No community shield either, he’s a fraud I guess it's harder to find a true uruguayan but Argentina it's close. And Julian had more recoveries in the final third, dribbles, and long passes. Once again a 32 G/A player in the Prem is elite 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 I could absolutely see him being a partner to Watkins or playing the shadow striker role behind. I meant PL teams which apparently I missed You think Solanke is better than Alvarez?? What? He’s definitely a better fit for Liverpool than Nunez or Gakpo as a 9. Bournemouth would 100% adapt their lineup to accommodate Alvarez if he fell into their lap. > Competent team  _Everyone_ takes you to the cleaners Torres at City showed only flashes and was clearly still raw and hadn't found his role in the team. Barca must have assumed it was the lack of clear role keeping him raw and inconsistent when it was him being raw and inconsistent that kept his role loosely defined. I think its reasonable in this market. Hes played mostly out of position for us due to Haaland. Hes been amazing whenever hes played. His numbers have been great. I think he will be brilliant for Athletico, and suits them and Simeone perfectly. He will score bags of goals for them and improve their team. There is a real lack of quality strikers around also currently. I think it will be money well spent for Athletico and im sad to see him go. We got him for a steal from River Plate. I just dont think we could ever keep him and Haaland happy in the long term. Alvarez probably looked better for Argentina than City. I don't think he overly suited our team with Haaland in it. He somehow played the most minutes and never felt like a 1st teamer. I think this move will be great for him he’s honestly just a really good player. He scored a double hattrick for river Plate in the Argentinian league before he came here and has been great at every level. The Fee is crazy high because he is good and is a forward. Well he jumped out of a big swimming pool into the baby pool didn't he Nitpicking your comment but it's nitpicking not nick picking, mate. And it’s nitpicking not nickpicking, mate. With Grizzy behind them? im stupidly horny. Bro stfu. Yes you are. Playing little brother as RM is a weird thing to do coming off as UCL champion I’ll be happy if I’m proven wrong, I just think Alvarez isn’t as much of a game changer OP is implying I doubt Alvarez will make such an impact but we’ll see Most poeople are not good at watching football. Especially here. You dont need to write analysis, but your comment has zero substance. He can score goals and create goals. Never seen a player like that, must worth the money. If you told me he can pass as well, I would pay extra 10 from my own pocket Oh yes, biggest one of all. They love bringing back players. Costa, Griezmann, Filipe Luis, Carrasco... Atletico definently has the money to spend. Their owners are just cheap. Not really, this is a reasonable price tho. 70 mil and 25 in bonuses. He’s on much lower wages, cheaper to buy (assuming Napoli stick to release clause), younger, speaks the language and will adapt to the league better imo (has Argentines in the team already and South American/Spain culture have lots of similarities). His movement and intelligence + technique is unreal. Perfectly suits la liga [deleted] Part of that reason is the alternatives city have though, not everyone has Haaland or de bruyne as the other option. > there's a reason he rode the bench in key games.     Yea he was second fiddle to the best #9 of his generation and his coach refused to play 2 up front Riding the bench for city is a testament to a players ability alone. Means they’re good enough to be on peps bench. Although he also managed to Pam play 50 games for city so idk his not versatile though, his solely a second striker I genuinely don't know why I've been downvoted. You don’t rate? He didn't bag 17 goals as a striker that is the point. Playing sole striker you have to do a hell of a lot of stuff you don't have to do if you are secondary striker or winger. Griezmann is an unbelievable player but he can not be a sole striker, and bags in goals as SS or elsewhere. Mbappe is much better not as a striker. List goes on. No one is arguing he isn't a good player, Atleti is buying him for 95 million.  Kolo Muani was a player of the year for Bundesliga, had 23 goals 17 assists for a G+A of 40 in 46 games, and went for 75 million. Alvarez hasn't had a season doing that and is going for a higher price, because we can all see his potential, but that is what it is :potential as a striker. Nunez didn't watch him as Benfica no idea.  No one is acting as some unproven project he is being sold for 95 million, acting as if 95 million is not that much is the ridiculous notion. Against his will 😄🥲 I don't think 25+10 is an insulting offer but you put the price. Hancko will remain unhappy in Feyenord this season. Let's see if you get more money than Atleti is offering. Yeah, /u/Merfolks buy players you can afford like /u/Similar_Jackey_8109 does Look at the prices this transfer window, this fee is really high, it definitely isn't a cut price Well, first of all, when you said ""accomplished"", I didn't assume you were talking strictly about goals and assists.  Sancho by the time he joined United: 50 goals, 57 assists (excl. international involvement)  Alvarez now: 77 goals, 38 assists (excl. international involvement)  So using your own criteria you're wrong. Unless you want to say Alvarez time at River Plate doesn't count for some reason?  That's before even looking at things like major honours won, international involvement, overall reputation.  If you meant to say Sancho was more accomplished than Alvarez when they were both 21 then yes I would agree, but if you meant Sancho was more accomplished at 21 than Alvarez is now you have to bring a stronger case than relying solely on goals and assists. Why are you a) selectively discounting Alvarez time at River Plate (and his international involvement with Argentina) to make the argument work and b) using goals and assists as the be all and end all for what counts as someone being accomplished (which, by the way, I already dismantled in a comment below)? Ha, well played sir He's also notably better than Solanke though... I guess you can say it's a gamble to sign him. Well Felix was an absolutely stupid signing for them. A child could have told them that Felix would never suit their play style. Griezeman works his socks off for a team, Felix just canters along. It’s a signing I could never understand unless Simone was leaving. Felix was effectively just a trade for Griezmann. Not really a good example to use for their spending. Somebody like Lemar on the other hand... I guess they want to make a statement especially cause their city rivals have also strengthened a lot. Not really true, that was only from the latest Deloitte Money League. Before that Atleti had been ahead of Milan and Inter for like a decade. Wait for this year's version and I'm sure Atleti will be clear again  Dortmund/Atleti have been changing back and forth between 12th and 13th position in the Deloitte Money League for years, Inter and Milan catching up is only a recent thing with consistent CL football. I'm pretty sure Atleti spends more on wages than the other three aswell  The four clubs are similar in terms of earnings, but Atleti are happier to spend. Dortmund are terrified of spending more than 35M on a player and Inter have their owner problems. Also don't forget the huge sports city complex that Atleti is building around the stadium, that will probably push them ahead of the others again Not even close. Wikipedia says Gil Marin is ranked about 52nd in Spain. Alongside Sørloth it should be pretty good is my guess. Being ""mid"" in everything on a world class level doesn't mean hes a mid player. > Alvarez was an elite striker before he joined City.  No, he wasnt. You cant be an elite striker these days when you have never played in Europe and proven yourself there. So, Álvarez when he was still playing in the argentinian league was a promising striker, not elite, thats why City paid like 14M for him. We’re hardly the gold standard for price negotiation Could it be, and hear me out, that Alvarez being an overpay and Hojlund also being an overpay are not mutually exclusive?? Don’t think u/R4lfXD was personally responsible for that one mate How's that relevant other than their flair? You're attacking them based on the flair. Both can be true, Hojlund doesn't need to be acknowledged when the topic is Alvarez 64mil with 8mil addons, get your facts straight Man Utd tax is like 30 million on top of whatever fee other teams would be paying so not a fair comparison Who's scored one less goal than Alvarez did in his first season (in a far more disconnected team).   Alvarez has never been anything special. But maybe I'll be proven wrong. I ain't got no dog in this fight but honestly you're an easy target to mention Because you are in a banter era, acting like an absolute banter club.  And considering the history and what your club did to the Premier League, financially doping and devaluing the fair competition, many of us are enjoying this clown show that Chelsea is. May it continue this way, ideally even worse. We have no need for a profile like Alvarez.  Why would we spend 90m on a starting striker when Jackson has shown incredible promise?   Why would we play him as 10 or an SS when we have Nkunku?  It's easy to say that the club should target elite talents instead of teenagers but the youth farm aside we have targeted players based on profile and underlying numbers rather than name recognition when it comes to building the squad and quite a few of them showed their promise in the last tumultuous season. Shut the fuck up karma farmer Well I think you are wrong. Arsenal were a similar threat level to us at the time we sold both players, as Chelsea are to us now. Less so even, with the potential in Chelsea's squad.  No one expected Zinny and Jesus to have such an immediate impact on Arsenal's level.  >What do you mean you almost got them back on track with Palmer?  I mean exactly what I said. He *almost* got them back on track. Are you disagreeing that he was their main man dragging them through last season or something? And without him they had no chance of finishing where they did?  Why would we want to give them Alvarez now too? Explain it to me.  >I believe Arsenal would be the only club City would not sell to, this summer  Well that's good for you but I think you're wrong. The point is that our board is willing to pay obscene fees, yet they wanted nothing to do with Alvarez at these numbers. Yep, and one of their stats isn't heavily inflated by playing for City He could score 30 goals and it would still be an overpay. rock dependent truck hungry swim skirt towering future divide wrong   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Lol absolutely raw dogged everyone We do, We do 🎵 I’m bored at work and looking at my phone.  Saying people are triggered just because they have the complete opposite opinion to you is just pathetic.   You edited your comment and added a whole paragraph adding more context to your original comment. So yes I replied to the same comment, but my second comment was in regard to your edit.   You are correct I support Liverpool but we aren’t the only other team in the league. City’s financial cheating doesn’t affect only Liverpool. And how do you know? The number that is often spread around the social media is for the whole coaching staff, not just Simeone, so the information about his salary is unknown publicly. It's what transfermarkt says 🤷🏻‍♂️ Except it’s true and it was reported at the time. No clue how we got 60m back for Morata and Costa each from Atletico but it happened. In fact it was 58m for Morata and 57m for Costa 27 goal involvements in the premier league for a 27 year old striker is clearly past his prime? He disappeared in the 2nd half of the season and was wanting out, which led to the very public fallout with Conte (thanks for the seasono) but there was nothing much to suggest he was clearly past it. The drop off in form was mainly attributed to him being unhappy living in England and it was reasonable to think he’d be back at his best when he was happy. It was a pretty big deal back in the day that Chelsea were able to get that much for someone who very publicly wanted to return to Spain (or go to China). Do you ? Rodri Not even Bayern likes to spend big on signings. Their wages are crazy high, sure. But Harry Kane was an anomaly and it was just 100m(90+add-ons) if I'm not mistaken. Oh for sure, but they've done a good job convincing their fans to go with it lol. We lack quality defenders. Hopefully with Østigård moving, he'll get regular gametime and will be a solid defensive foundation for us. You clown [deleted] Looks like spurs are about to sign solanke so that’s probably why Isak, Hojlund, Solanke, Havertz. This is a truly disgusting overpay. As a solo 9 yeah I do.  Alvarez to me can do a few things well but isn't great at holding the ball up, isn't good in the air, isn't especially good at dribbling.   His quality is that he's got good ball striking and runs a fair amount imo which isn't enough I've got to disagree, Nunez is better than Alvarez imo and you can definitely make an argument for Jota (who is Alvarez but better at the thing Alvarez is meant to excel at) 115 I disagree. He's looked very solid for us whenever he's played. The only issue is that we can't fit Haaland, KDB and Alvarez in the XI all at once. One of them has to sit out, and it's Alvarez.   He filled in ably both alongside Haaland and in place of him Scheiße lol So will y'all play a diamond then? i got this AMD for you, A Massive Dick. If you want more information, the internet is available. except costa they all were great tbh I said spare, meaning 100m isn't much to Madrid, and they can easily eat that loss if the player flops. Atleti can't Wages fair enough. I don't know if the release clause is relevant since Napoli seems open to negotiating with Chelsea. He's only a year younger which is nothing really. Fair enough on the language and culture too, but my point was just that there are indeed better strikers available on the market. He has a release clause of €120m and Napoli have shown they are open to negotiating with Chelsea on that. I do think he can potentially lead the line tbh and with his attributes most managers will also use him out wide at times. But yeah, he is primarily a second striker.  70+25m isn't a steal for Alvarez. I rate him but that's still a gross overpay. he s gonna have a ferran torres career arc. >'I can only train well and play well. That's what I focus on. It is not entirely true that Atlético makes my head spin, I have a good contract here. I understand that Feyenoord wants to get the most out of it, and there is nothing else I can do about it. I'm not going to make a fuss. I love this club.'  Yeah he fucking hates it here I don't like Atleti attitude about Hancko. The player did everything he could but we didn't make a proper offer. I hope we can comeback with 35M€ to sign Hancko because I think he is the player we need. Where can I check that? Transfermarkt? Yeah his time at river plate(which is where the majority of those stats come from) few years ago doesn’t really count on the same level lets be honest.  Maybe you can debate on what counts under “accomplished“ but Pre-United Sancho was simply more highly rated than current Julian Alvarez. That’s all I’m trying to say. With Toney, it's a gamble. Solanke could be great under Ange Is he? He has 36 goals and 11 assists in the PL. 11 of those goals are penalties.  Solanke got 19 goals and 3 assists last season. Even if you include the not so good season before that it becomes 25 goals and 10 assists, with just two pens.  And this is sample size where Toney has played an extra half a season. Notably better feels exaggerated. I mean I don't disagree, just saying why teams might not be in for him Is he though? Solanke performed much better than him last season This is pure revisionism. Yes, it was incredibly risky. It always is when you pay huge transfer fees for very young players. But I don't think it was clear that it was going to be a failure. Where were you then with your sagacious wisdom? Nobody said this at the time. In a world where arsenal wanted 40 mil for nketiah… clubs around the world paying 50-60 mil for scrubs…. 70 mil for an actual world class young forward is not an overpay Holy fuck, get out of here with your logic! I just struggle to see how one would think 60+20 is a ""fair price"" if you saw your very own club pay more for an objectively worse striker. The market isn't suddenly going to correct itself, especially not for strikers. Because that literally shows what the market price is for a striker at the moment.      Don't get your knickers in a twist. That's POUNDS dumb dumb. Ah yes 1 less goal ... in an extra 500 minutes and 12 more starts lol.      They're not in the same tier dude . >Who's scored one less goal than Alvarez did in his first season  It's because you analyse football in that simplistic way, that's why you cannot see what a huge difference there was between Alvarez and Hojlund last year.   You can go on fbref to see a more in-depth comparison and see that in most of the important metrics, Alvarez has literally x2 better stats. Plus much better in defensive actions, shot creating actions, possession. It's not even comparable. What a ridiculous comparison. Atletico aren't paying for Alvarez two years ago they're paying for the player that got 20 G+A in the prem last sesason Banter's great, try having an original thought sometime You sound like an idiot  When I say that Alvarez is the best striker on the market this summer, for a Maresca system, I'm starting from the fundamental idea that Chelsea is in the market for a striker, based on multiple, credible reports this summer.   >We have no need for a profile like Alvarez. > Why would we spend 90m on a starting striker when Jackson has shown incredible promise? > Why would we play him as 10 or an SS when we have Nkunku?  If Chelsea is not in the market for a striker, then I agree with you. > I mean exactly what I said. He almost got them back on track. Are you disagreeing that he was their main man dragging them through last season or something? And without him they had no chance of finishing where they did?  How does that affect you? They were no threat to you all season, very far from it. Attributing any other meaning to what ""back on track"" would mean, from City's point of view, escapes me.   >Less so even, with the potential in Chelsea's squad.  You're being disingenuous. Arsenal were showing a project and had an elite manager at the helm. Chelsea show the opposite right now. An absolute mess, a stupid project going on. Signing a bunch of 16 year olds for a lot of money, without any senior appearance, instead of players that would improve them this season. I want to know what you consider a good striker. Let's have a laugh. Shh!! Them bridge people are definitely up to something. It fair to call people triggered if they reply with hostility. Money laundering, definitely something under the table when Mendes is involved. His point is that footballers will only show you what they want you to see. We dont know them as a person or have any interaction with them, but dont put them in a pedestal because after all they are humans and regular people outside of the pitch Cook him Won't claim to be an expert in Norwegian players but I always sign Aursnes on FIFA cus he's a fucking baller. Don't know how well that translates into real life lol Atleti also signed Sorloth, I don't really know that much about him. Is he valued in Norway? I know he had a good season last year scoring the second most goals (scored the most non-penalty goals though) in La Liga. Right, but I would count UCL performance on par with PL, and havertz really struggled in UCL. The season is not just PL ….million USD for Paul Pogba, a former United academy player Name 1 charge without Google >A charge  is an accusation that someone committed a crime that must be proven in court. **A charge is not indicative of guilt**; you are innocent until proven guilty and the government must prove each and every element of the charge.  City probably knows that they can drop or dismiss the charges which could be a reason for strongly denying the accusations. If they plead guilty or just admit it they could possibly get  less severe punishments. United fan so not keeping up with City transfers too much,  but seeing Alvarez go when KDB is 33 is absolutely wild to me. I figured if anything cash in on KDB and continue with Haaland and Alvarez Well KDB is probably having his last season with us, and Haaland maybe 2 more (unless Pep leaves, then he may stay longer).  I think this is a great move for Julian, and for City and for AM I honestly have no idea wtf is the plan. Long term Julián should be Griezmann replacement, this season? Kinda of a fuck It we ball situation i guess. Simeone is highly adaptable with his formation and tactics. If you’re going to sign 2 starting strikers and you have probably the best second striker in the world, you play all 3 I imagine. Even Torres found his old form in Atletico. He was legit very good for 2 seasons. Too bad you did not get Falcao back as well. They can tho, they arent even fan owned. Uts not like they will go bankrupt. I don’t think so. He’s heading straight to the top !RemindMe 1 year don't know why the other guy was trolling mate. really wanted the deal to work out but the out club is just caught in two minds. hermoso hasn't gotten a proper offer yet so they don't want to go all in on hancko just yet. but I really hoped we'd get him instead of flashy signings I was just making fun of the way both of you were talking as though you run the clubs Yeah I don't agree that his stats at River Plate don't count but yeah obviously if that's your frame of reference I can see why you would reach that conclusion. Yourjokebutworse [deleted] I don't even want Toney, but last season should probably be looked at as an outlier since he missed most of the season and was working back up to match fitness for a while after that. yep, i remember thinking along the lines of ""well AM is gritty enough, they grinded out results but couldn't get through to the finish lines the last few years, maybe adding some flair would be the missing ingredient to bring them to the next level""  people would be saying haaland's playstyle doesn't fit man city, but they won the treble with him breaking scoring records It's not revisionism, the reactions were something between ""he just won't fit"" and ""he might fit but it's still a gross overpay"", it was headscratcher for most and you can go back to the [signing thread on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/c5w8i4/fabrizio_romano_official_and_confirmed_joao_felix/) to see it. Not sure why this is upvoted. As a Benfica fan, yes it was clear it was gonna fail.  Felix was playing in a system that was pretty much the exact opposite of Simeone's system, it made no sense and I was cursing Felix for accepting Atlético from the day he was announced. How so? At the time everyone was saying how on earth would Felix adapt to Simone’s demands and mentality of how his team plays. I know he was young but to say it wasn’t being flagged is utter rubbish. Yes clubs do take a chance on players but  this was a huge risk for them knowing how Felix plays and his mentality. That isnt revisionism at all, if you go back to any of the treads about it there were plenty of people who predicted exactly what would happen. That he was a bad fit for Simeones playstyle, that he might get into a conflict with Simeone when not getting enough minutes or utilized like he wants, him going out on loan because it is impossible to sell him.  The surprising thing is that he actually had a very good period with Atletico when Simeone changed his way of playing and moved on from his very defensive shit housing tactics. I love when people say it's revisionism about something that most people thought was true at the time. It was always a ridiculous transfer that only happened to make some money for Mendes. At best it was going to be an overpay. As a Benfica fan I thought he was making a big mistake by going to Atlético and many thought the same. The majority opinion of r/soccer was definitely that it was destined to fail Posting on a forum like Reddit 😂 You're not wrong, the striker market is basically non existant Overall  you're right, but there is no way Julian Alvarez is world class. Someone asks you who are the best attackers in the world, no way he comes to mind But even by your logic, this isn't 70m. This is close to 90m. That was the amount that bought you a Rice or Van Dijk or Grealish. I don't think Alvarez is a bad player at all, I think hes pretty damn good...but is he just shy of a 100m decision maker/final piece player? No - I'd say he's not that final piece player.  All in all, it's probably a reflection of how bonkerz ans inflated the market is. If everyone is an overpay maybe that's just the market.  Darwin is an overpay, Alvarez is an overpay, Hojlund is an overpay, Gonçalo Ramos is an overpay, seems like every striker is an overpay. Because it is possible to think that both are overpays. >Because that literally shows what the market price is for a striker at the moment.    >Don't get your knickers in a twist.  It doesn't really if both are an overpay, two data points is not evidence enough Also in a far far better team tbf if we are laying all the facts down Man City and Man United as a whole aren't in the same tier.   The fact he's pulled those numbers out his ass is testament to him. With barely anyone passing to him lol.  Alvarez has world class talent all around him. Not the same tier dude. I didn't make the comparison, homeboy did by bringing Holjund into it. no u Chelsea is not in the market for a striker of his Profile, we have Jackson to drop deep and link up play, we have Nkunku to play as a 10 or even a false 9, hell even Palmer can play as a 10 freeing up the right wing for Noni.  The profile of the striker we lack is a battering ram, hence our targets for the strikers have been all of the same elk.  It actually shows squad planning rather than just going after whatever is the hot property. >Attributing any other meaning to what ""back on track"" would mean, from City's point of view, escapes me.  Oh well. Maybe try think about it some more and it might come to you, I'm not here to hold your hand through a discussion. It's a general term, figure it out.  >You're being disingenuous.   Oh bore off. If you don't like my opinion, that's fine but don't say I'm not being sincere just because you disagree.   To use your words: Arsenal ""were no threat to you all season, very far from it"" when we sold to them.  Also you think we'd sell Alvarez to Liverpool?! lol. I genuinely can't be arsed with this mate. It seems you miss the point entirely. He might be a fantastic signing. That doesn't mean it's worth it to spend 100m on him.  If it goes absolutely perfectly, at best you're getting around what you paid for. If he doesn't perform perfectly, or god forbid doesn't do well, you've crippled your squad for a while due to the outlay. ludicrous deliver chief quickest hurry march pie complete wasteful escape   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Please tell me where i started the hostility?  In my opinion you started the hostility in your edit on your first post by starting your edited paragraph with “A lot of people seem to be triggered” instead of being open to discuss a different opinion, you just act hostile and say everyone is triggered if they think differently to you. Definitely seems like there was something shady with it, otherwise I don’t get why Atleti would pay so much for two players that it was well known would no longer have a place in our team He was good in the national team, but retired this year. Dunno how he is at club level, but I'd guess pretty good. He is valued, great player who is actually quite versatile. Has been playing on the right for the national team due to Håland being Håland. I think he will do well at Atleti, he fits the mentality pretty well, has good technique for his size and is a good finisher with his feet and his head. Sick burn In what universe is my ability to recall individual charges even remotely relevant? Talk about compensating. Truly pathetic. Alvarez is just a little bit awkward in Citys squad.  He plays too high and doesn't have the skillset to take the ball from midfield and drive it into dangerous zones, so he can't replace KDB tactically as a like for like.  Equally Haaland is a horrible goal funnel who is effectively undroppable and warps any teams tactics to suit him but he lives on the shoulder of the defender.  Alvarez wants to play at the top of the team but sat deeper and bringing other guys in. He'd normally be great for Pep but he's not going to displace Haaland. They probably have Wirtz on their wishlist KDB is arguable our greatest ever player. “Cashing in” on him would be a very disappointing ending and never seemed likely. Alvarez is a great KdB replacement for injury/rotation *while we have KdB.* As in he can play in the midfield when we need him to but he's not suited to that midfield role well enough to be in the squad *as a midfielder* let alone outright replacing KdB in the squad. He's not good enough at keeping the ball under pressure or positioning himself to help relieve pressure for other players. Among other issues.  The only position he can be a first team player in our team is striker. but he's not going to replace Haaland as long as he's here. That torres one is an exaggeration, he never got close to his pre injury quality but he was a useful addition. They really can't, tho, because their owners don't like spending money, and if an expensive player flops, that just won't write it off as a loss as easily. Felix is the perfect example Ok Harry Just two. Which is in the comment already. He wasn't great at Chelsea or Barcelona either Flagged and ""a child could have told them it would *never* suit their play style"" are not equivalencies. And yet his best seasons amongst Chelsea, Atletico, and Barça was the season at Atletico before his fallout with the manager and he was the teams player of the season. He has an attitude problem, not a fit problem True, he doesn’t come to mind probably bc of his age and being in Haalands shadow. He got 32 G/A last season in less starts and limited minutes - I think once he’s the main striker at a top team, we will see what he can do on a regular basis. But I do think that for someone of his age, who just extended his contract last year, that this is a good price in this market imo. He’s scored and assisted 53 times in 2 years for the most competitive squad in the world to get minutes in.  He played a major role in Argentinas World Cup. He is world class Grealish and Rice were 100m POUNDS brother. Its not close.      There's always a premium for strikers and if you think Alvarez is not clearly a tier above or more proven than Hojlund or Nunez, I don't know what to tell you. Sure some of the fee is probabky appearances based, some goals, but there’s probabky a UCL win clause, a LanLiga win clause, and ballon for clause. Alvarez is much better than Grealish. Literally this. That has ALWAYS been the case for strikers.      I'm questioning the age of this thread, I guess tbf there has been a pretty big drought for strikers in the last 10 years. Darwin is worth every penny in entertainment alone Nah, not possible, there can only exist one overpay The point is its not an overpay when that's what the market price is. There's always been a premium for striker I don't know where have you been. You're not exactly providing alternative data to disprove the argument. In the absence of more data points it's a fair comparison for OP to make if a caveat is made to say this is only one example. Ultimately we're on Reddit. No one's going to write up dissertations to prove their point and it's unreasonable to expect that. Alvarez rarely plays as the focal point though, more often he's a bit deeper, at least when he's playing with Håland. What? You twisted the comparison to somehow connect this Alvarez sale to his stats in his first season at City when he cost 1/4 of Højlund's price. As has been stated several times, you have scrubs that only have surname or nationality attached to them being sold for 80m but for some reason Alvarez with a WC as protagonist and 2x Copa America (good performance on the last one) is somehow too expensive.  These are the prices of today, we need to get used to them. I’m gonna sit here and go into a heated debate about some trivial as city finances. It’s not going to change regardless of our views. I think both got better things to do than go into a Reddit comment brawl. Let’s just say you are right, and end it here.  Have a Nice day 😊 Wow, one of the youngest national team retirements I've heard of. that's funny, håland being håland Nah he got you blood Just parroting 115 doesn’t do anything, we’re innocent until proven guilty Yeah you and Jangles make fair points, plus Alvarez can be the star player for Atlético that Haaland is for City and the competition at striker for ARG national team is pretty stiff. time for him to move into the spot light these next few years with this move and di maria retiring from the national team. 11 league goals... 32 G/A is a very generous stat considering City steam roll teams in Cup competitions. [deleted] Hes just not when you've watched him enough Why is Alvarez more proven than Nunez? Nunez has the same number of goals and more assists in less minutes and in a worse team  Nunez is better The market price can be wrong from a return on investment point of view though. If this is the price of a relatively unproven striker in the current market then maybe you would be better off investing the money in other ways to get a better return.   Just because this is the price that can be asked, doesn't mean you have to pay it. Again, I didn't make the comparison in the first place.   Someone saw a United flair, decided to say ""but you overpaid for Holjund too"" and I defended the player.   It's no biggie really. Got any examples of those scrubs? I agree just not worth it 😂 to be fair I don’t think any of us can really be right, there are so many loopholes and rule changes I can’t keep up 😂 How well did that go for Everton? He was a huge part of why they kept pace in the first half of the season with Liverpool and Arsenal. Without him, City don’t get 3 points vs Newcastle, Brighton, etc. 11 league goals and 9 league assists in ~2650 minutes means his p90 involvement was 0.677 and that’s very high for a 24 year old that was playing out of position bc of Haaland 31 starts < 32 G/A   And I should clarify, limited minutes in the striker position* since he got a long run in midfield and it didn’t work out, he’s just not an 8 Do you think Nunez coming from Benfica is more ""proven"" than Alvarez now coming off his last season at City and a world cup win. That's the comparison. I don’t understand what you’re trying to say? A player who sucks at city is better than a player who played a key role in the title win last season? True 👍. I was trying to state the trend I’m seeing. Not that I’m a fan of it.   Sometimes we can caught in Reddit discussions, and I always feel drained after a heated discussion 😂  Anyways, have lovely day at work my friend 😊 completely irrelevant shit Just cuz they were guilty doesn’t mean we are Jesus had better GI p90 in I think all of his seasons at City or at least very similar. The previous person said that Alvarez is clearly a tier above and more proven than Nunez when he isn't.  Nunez gets more goals and assists when playing Do you really think the Premier League manufactured 115 charges out of nowhere? City's success is nothing but positive for the PL. City's success being a result of cheating is not. Yeah his was similar, he was typically playing LW/ST which are his preferred positions. Pep shoehorned Alvarez into the 8 apart from the 5 week stretch where Haaland was injured, we’ll never know but I wonder what his numbers would look like if he had the 9 at City for an entire season I’m not sure what equation your using. Maybe a troll. But Nunez is an Everton level player. Doesn’t matter what I think, neither does it matter what you do. It’s innocent until proven guilty, and we haven’t been proven guilty. Same thing happened last time, and we were found not guilty Nunez has the same number of goals and more assists in less minutes. Is there some new metric to judge strikers by that I'm unaware of? …Nunes did not score 19 goals last season… and he can’t even feature for the team. Both have 10 goals in the prem, Nunez has 600 less minutes  Nunez has 18 goals in 500 less minutes overall  Nunez outscores alvarez Yea I just don’t know what to tell you but Darwin is not as good as Alvarez. Maybe someday. But Liverpool do much better this year with Alvarez instead Genuinely based on what? The only thing Alvarez has is fitness as he's able to play more games without picking up a niggle  Nunez scores more goals per 90, assists more per 90, and puts in more defensive work. Better at interplay, as good at scoring better at passing, better pressing. Doing all of that playing out of position and in a system that doesn’t suit him. So worse at scoring as he has less goals per 90, better at interplay, worse at pressing as he has worse tackles, attempts, and distance covered, and all playing in the best team in the world  Sounds like someone that's worse than nunez"

How much money does Atlético have? atletico looking strong. sorloth, normand, alvarez, gallagher. hancko maybe [removed] The reverse Aguero deal Atletico is here for business this year So who do City have for Haaland backup or are they now in the market for a striker? Not necessarily a surprise but what is surprising is the lack of rumours linking City to a replacement. Unless I've missed them? Or unless someone else in the squad is expected to fill his role. Sounds like a good deal for Atleti Atleast 70m pound sounds good Gallagher and Alvarez are great signings for Atletico. Props to them. I feel like ~£70m is a fair fee for Alvarez. Sad to see him go, but City do not hold players hostage. It’s time for a gazump, PSG. Throw in another 50K/week! A versatile industrious forward that gets goals and assists. This is the Simeone blueprint. Sounds like deal to sell Omorodion to Chelsea has been agreed. All the best to him. Great guy, good player but he was never going to get a starting spot in out first 11. We are simply overcrowded and his position is hard to implement for us. He is not natural 10, not a winger. Maybe false 9 (?) who we dont use week-in-week-out. I’m sure Simeone will love to build a team around him. Good business for Atletico! Atleti are cooking this window I thought this guy would easily go for 90-100m, I guess I was wrong £70m + £10m in add-ons will be a good deal for the City. Sad to see him go but it's always better when the club and players leave on good terms. I'm not understanding where the current opinion that Lvarez is suddenly overrated or not worth 70 mil came from. He's been class for city every time he's played as the main striker and is also class for Argentina. I'm gonna miss him but him wanting to leave makes sense and I hope he smashes it at Atletico Atletico and world class South American strikers is a match made in heaven, he will be unreal for them. Seems like the perfect Atletico striker Who saw Atletico winning the transfer window tho [deleted] Great business there from City. 70M seems to be kind of a bargain value for Alvarez considering how inflated the market is currently. If this goes through, it's a master stroke by Atletico. The funds for Haaland’s next business venture have been secured. Get ready for him to break into the condiment market with…Haalandaise sauce. Would Sørloth still start? Huge signing for them. Reverse KUN The reverse Aguero Ok now tell us the real price that City got him for in 2022 Wonder how he will fair outside of Pep’s City Atletico cooking up interesting transfers this window. Excited to watch how they play next season. Why is Orny making me math on a Monday morning? Atletico's transfer window is something people would expect from Barca (in terms of activity , I don't mean the same transfers, tho I guess barca fans wouldn't mind those players) Baller window for Atletico if true. If it were United it would be reported as €90m [inc add ons] Would that mean their best 11 has Foden and KDB in the middle and Bobb on the right? An incredible Griezmann replacement Ladies and gentlemen , I am happy to announce we are back Feel like people are overrating Alvarez a bit here. Don't think he's this good at all. About to win that coveted netspend 🏆, one of the only ones missing Atleti betting hard this window. If the transfers doesn’t work plus Simeone’s wages will be rough. Especially with Tebas. Great deal for City. Alvarez still feels like a raw prospect for some reason despite winning a WC and being only 24. I think they won’t feel the miss at all, even if he is great for Atleti. overpay Would be a great move for his career. Glad he realized this early What a terrible deal for Atletico wtf happened to me “Spanish clubs are too broke”  I’m just pissy at the low balls they’d offer for Hojberg. Where are they getting the money from holy shit it’s actually happening. would be an insane signing for atletico, i hope he actually chooses them over psg. will be interesting to see if psg do anything now.   bit of a yikes that according to fab the deal is dependent on selling omorodion to chelsea. [deleted] i find alvarez overrated but him being only £5m more expensive than solanke is absurd. ""Would be at least £70m, 5 times what MCFC paid in 2022. "" is so much easier to read lol Ornstein helping twitter kids study their arithmetic, what a guy [removed] A lot. 12th to 14th highest revenues in world football, has been saving up money for a few years whilst mostly spending on infrastructure, shedding big salaries in Morata, Hermoso, Savic, Saul(well partly) etc and also like the other guy said they recently approved a 70M financial injection  Put Atlético in England and they woukd be the richest club outside the top six. Not sure why people are that surprised, out owners have just been cheap but now they don't have a choice but to rejuvenate the squad Enough to sign Julian Alvarez lol. What are they supposed to do, not sign anyone in the place of players leaving, would that improve their income? It's a great deal to get that player for that price if they can.   He might have a big impact on their income for the next 10 years. Griezmann is aging, big salaries of Morata, Depay, Hermoso and Carrasco left, would they be better off financially signing amateur players in their place?  Replacing Morata with Alvarez is a big thing. Well, maybe not according to commenters here, but let's imagine he performs like he's expected to, it's not a move anyone would refuse in their situation. I don't want Morata to feel hurt again, but Atletico cannot compete for the title when they pay salary of 13 million for performance like Morata's last season. Morata was not THE problem, but to be more competitive, teams need ""unfair"" deals like getting Julian Alvarez at a young age instead. Who knows... One day we can't scramble extra 5M for a good signing and the board goes around insultingly lowballing other clubs, the other we come up with more than 100M in like 24 hours... Great signings Normand is such a great get for them. Feel like he adds a different quality to their back line and he's just peaking as a player imo. The madrid teams look so fun this year. Going to have to tune in for those derbies. What about Griezmann? Will he play midfield?  Anyways, I'm really happy to see the resurgence of striker duos in elite teams. Álvarez specially seems to be a player that will thrive under this system. Rudiger by himself is gonna pocket them lmao and Mbappe is gonna bag 5 against alteti A debt repaid or something If we get Gallagher, Alvarez + another CB it will have been almost a perfect window. Maybe a backup RB aswell but there are other options there like Llorente or Riquelme  Edit: a DM certainly would be welcome aswell but let's not get overly greedy Except for Hancko return of false 9 foden gvardiol as inverted striker choupo on free Probably oscar bobb Buying a striker to play 10-15 games a season (in ideal circumstances) just isn’t the way we usually operate.   It’ll probably just be one of a number of players as a false 9 when Haaland doesn’t play, you could have Foden, Bobb, McAtee who is sticking around this season, to name a few.   Think it’ll be more likely we buy a player who can play 6 or 8 than it is we get a #9. Heard Carson got some natural goal instinct in training so Pep might use him as second striker. Probably False 9 back up with Foden, Bobb, De Bruyne, & Bernardo all playing there. I'm sure Doku and and Savinho can do a job as well. Not ideal, but not terrible. He needs no direct replacement, given he was a utility player in the first place. City will probably sign a midfielder with the money I'd suspect.  They could sign another striker but idk if it'd be worth it, Haaland manages his body as well as anyone maybe in football bar Ronaldo, he will have longevity and consistency unless he's severely injured. We have false 9 options in KDB, Foden, Bobb and it’s not impossible that Savinho could play there We’re stacked on wings, so likely a return for false 9. Foden, Bobb etc. are all able to play there when needed — Foden’s already been great there before actually F9 We don't need to replace Alvarez per se. Oscar Bobb looks elite and can take over those minutes if necessary. I'm more worried about singing a Rodri cover and a long term replacement for Kyle Walker. Felix going the other way could be interesting.   Some stability after constantly clashing with Simeone at Atletico, and then two loans at two messy clubs in Chelsea and Barcelona, getting coached by Guardiola, hopefully he's learned something after two hot and cold loans...   Also he sure as shit isn't going to stay at Atletico, and specially not if this Alvarez deal goes through.   Now that they've got a fair bit more money at the bank they probably wouldn't mind offloading him for a significantly cheaper fee and close Yeah it's a good deal for both sides money wise I think we're selling him on the bottom end of what he's worth. Hopefully we get a sell on or big bonuses based incentives (Pichichi, CL semi final, Copa del Rey win, etc). Yep  Will definitely be a World Class striker especially as the main man, but you can't complain when you have Erling Fookin Haaland l. Would Bernardo Silva not disagree with this? He’s been looking to leave for a couple summers, hasn’t he? Same. I'm hoping this is base fee prior to add ons. Third in goals + assist playing out of position 60% of the time. He's doing great. People hate City. Alvarez has been underperforming recently. Perfect combo. Alvarez world class? It kinda worked out he just wants to be the main striker, still played an important role in CL win. It worked out imo, just that he feels like he won't get to play in the position he wants and important games if Haaland is in City, also probably wants to be a key figure for club to fight the position for number 9 with Lautaro. Instead we have Doku Haaland Savinho or  Grealish Haaland Bernardo which is pretty great. Am I crazy to say I would take Julian +Mbappe over Endrick and Mbappe for Real Madrid? Since Julian and Endrick went for similar prices, I think Julian and Mbappe could play into each other much more than Endrick. As Mbappe tracks back to defend even less than Messi and Julian runs for 2 people If you watch Man City regularly, you will know 70m for Alvarez is a really good fee for City, not the other way around He will play a lot, Simeone himself said we need a bigger squad this year. And a hold up striker is needed to get the best from either Griezmann or Alvarez IMO  If Alvarez indeed joins, the more likely situation is that Griezmann leaves next summer unfortunately Probably. Both Julian and Griezmann are at their best playing with a holdup #9  I think Cholo will move Griezmann deeper into more of an attacking midfield role like he plays with France and play Sorloth+Julian up top TBH Either hes on bench or griezmann drops to a deeper midfield role 14m. Faired pretty well at his previous club, and looks good in the Argentina NT too. I think he’ll be fine he does pretty well for argentina He's great anywhere he plays. He's won every tournament he's competed in minus the olympics. If Alvarez for 70 mil is an overpay then I’m not sure what you’ve been watching. That’s the going rate for unproven wingers and forwards. Alvarez is a proven winner and goalscorer with the work rate to match. He is very good but got a bit sloppy with CAM routines made by Pep...very good for Argentina too bruh simeone's on a 70% wage cut post covid, despite being the single biggest reason as to why the club is even able to buy all these top players. why are people still going on about it. Hahahahaha Yes should have gotten havertz How so? Similar price as Havertz for a better player Huh? People downvoting you but you're 100% right I mean, we’re talking about a player at the end of his career vs a player in probably his prime Atlético isn’t broke they’re just cheap. Our owners suck It would've been interesting if he went to Tottenham. He would've been a great fit imo La Liga clubs have spent the least among top 5 leagues this window haven't they? Selling Samu probably He already chose Atleti, the presonal terms have been agreed like a few days ago, it's up the club to come up with the money and it's pretty much done. Alvarez looks like he’s made for Spain though. Joao Felix was too raw and was a stupid move which we all knew as soon as it happened. Alvarez started in a  world cup final and has won enough major trophies as a senior player. I think he’ll be great for 25 + goals in all comps. Solanke’s is a release clause, it’s what he’s worth to *us*.  Alvarez isn’t as important to City. >i find alvarez overrated  Why has so many people come out of the woodwork with this take recently, it's terrible Isn’t his market value like 90? Really? He'd be a starter for every team in the league outside of Man City with the exception I think of Newcastle because Isak is amazing Bruh Alvarez looks like a top 5 striker in the league just hasn't had enough game time. Never going to start ahead of Haaland but he's class af. Home grown. I don’t think solanke will go for 65 Alvarez is worth way more than 70m (24yo with 4 years left on his deal) but if he's getting sold outside of the Prem and not to Real or PSG he won't go for whatever his real market value is I don’t understand why Atleti are willing to stump up 70M for Alvarez and another 30 for Gallagher instead of just buying Osimhen, who is a bonafide star striker.  He’s no worse than the fourth best in the world right now and certainly has a case for 3rd after Haaland and Mbappe with Kane and Lewa getting older.   Edit: not that I mind! I don’t think Alvarez is good enough to start for us even if Haaland were to leave, so getting 70M for that player is an opportunity you leap at. Wait, Solanke is about to be sold for 65 million? You are joking right? Oi what's their secret? This has pretty consistently been their approach the last decade or so. A few years with little spending then a big blowout window  The amount of salaries they lost in the last year is amazing. Starting with Carrasco who was at the very end of the last year's window. Presumably more than 50 million euro shedded for players that were performing just ok. It's just a great moment for Atletico to invest in new players. I swear there was a hugely upvoted comment a week ago in a thread about them making insultingly low bids for Hancko, saying they were struggling for money. Alvarez will bang in at least 20 goals in LaLiga. Minimum 10 assists also. Alvarez will bang in at least 20 goals in LaLiga. Minimum 10 assists also. He's been playing centrally on-off behind the attacking line for a while. I believe he's moving deeper more exclusively this season. Should be absolutely going for laporte. [removed] Imagine Todibo as CB I think the club caught in two minds about him, hence the lowballing. Hermoso as of yet is still in the squad. If he ends up staying in any case, paying Feyenoord that much will erase their chances of getting a RB/Guerra. So it makes sense, regardless you guys shouldn't have to think about all these lol. Truly sorry about the situation, as a supporter of Atleti. If Javi galan or Joao Felix leaves hes as good as gone lad. Then who is the backup for Foden? Haha. It's happening lads Who need Gvardiol as false striker when GOAT Scott Carson is around The feared Romero inverted striker vs the rising star Gvardiol inverted striker. Reading the comments here, should be an improvement for Man City. Do you think McAtee will get many games? Where does he play best? Savio is one of the most wingery wingers out there, highly doubt he'll play as striker in his first season in the Prem Savinho 😂😂😂 It’d probably be Bobb before Foden given how good Foden was in the 10 role last year He has but no one came in with an offer at City’s valuation. It appears that Atletico has met City’s valuation for Alvarez. Both conditions need to be met for City to sell the player. Bernardo wants to leave for Barca or Madrid. Which he can do. He loves the club just hates England weather Silva is a lot more important to City than Alvarez, I assume that despite him being older they are far less inclined to let him leave. Money is probably not the biggest issue.  Also Silva probably showed some interest in trying something different at some point(s), but he's probably the last guy on that squad who would sulk and see his form deteriorate if he doesn't get a move Hell yeah [deleted] I mean better than all of your strikers Yes. Absolutely Is the third best striker in the Prem not world class? Alvarez is only 1 year and 1 month younger than Mbappe. So if he comes here, he would be facing the same problem that he is leaving for. So from Real's perspective, getting Endrick would be better than Alvarez. From Alvarez perspective too, going to a different team is better.  Now for the price, Alvarez currently seems to be better. But we never know if Endrick is gonna go through Vini path or Reiner path. If Julian is not worth 70M then there are at worst 3 strikers that are worth 70M in the world.  Haaland, Lautaro and Osimhen Not true. He's been great every time he's started as a striker for us. He only looks worse when playing out of position in midfield Griezmann’s shifting to a midfield role. He didn’t play in midfield. He played as a second striker. [Juli at River](https://i.gyazo.com/a8a080012d72104eb3f72637f8d8c5ed.png) vs [Juli at City last season](https://i.gyazo.com/fd0faedd325c8b74ecb0b65cf7fdece5.png). He’s operating in literally almost identical areas. He’s just not as good as people think he is and they want to make excuses for why he was poor for large parts of last season. Yes he’s worthy of the money Man City when they saw they're getting £70m for Alvarez I wouldn’t exactly say 29 is at the “end” holding mids can go pretty deep into 30s. But I still see what you are saying Fair 🤝 > Alvarez isn’t as important to City  Complete nonsense. He played the 6th most minutes of any outfielder in City’s squad last season. ""Alvarez isn't as important to City"" just points out how absurd some people are on this subreddit fr, now watch people get shocked when he crushes it for atletico. some players just don't jive with pep ball that shit's extremely limiting and boring he finished 7th in the ballon d’or and gets world class shouts. he is absolutely overrated. Anyone who has eyes and watched him be underwhelming for a lot of last season despite playing for a hugely dominant side will tell he's over-rated. You're literally in this thread insinuating 70m is a bargain. If that's not over-rating him I don't know what is.    100m on Alvarez and Conor Gallgher. Good grief what a huge sum of money on two incredibly just okay players. Yeah and someone suddenly rates him highly. Funny how that works. He's a top 20% player that's being priced as a top 5% player and some people are now talking about him like he's a top 1% player.      I think he'll do fine in a slightly easier league and at a team with slightly lower expectations though. I’d have to find my comments but I’ve been saying that since early 2023. He's an incredible player and if he were an everyday starter could be one of the best strikers in the league. His only mistake is playing in the same side as *the* best striker in the world. If he goes to athletico he and Sorloth are going to be getting all the chances funneled through them. Bodes well imo. Nunez is shit at finishing = donkey striker.  Alvarez is shit at finishing = ballon d'or contender Bruh moment, then people ask why some say he's overrated.  Alvarez doesn't have much vision, passing ability or dribble, but people scream he is world class. Or they say he is a top 5 striker while they barely seen the guy play striker.  What I know is that he showed glimpses 2 seasons ago of being an interesting player, but playing as a 9,5 this season, which he played a lot in Argentina, to me he was another Ferran/Nolito, kinda basic player with not much of a repertoire skill wise. Alvarez imo isn't even a top 5 striker in the PL. > Alvarez is worth way more than 70m  ???? Based on what? >Alvarez is worth way more than 70m  No he isn't lmao yeah ig this is it. he must be insistent on going to spain because tottenham should be going for him if they’re willing to spend that much on solanke Lautaro Is better than Osimhen. He has been more consistent and proven at the highest level in the Champions League. Secret levers, innit Being a billionaires toy their socios are idiots like Barca’s during Barto’s tenure I mean this is a pretty safe buy anyway, everyone knows exactly what Alvarez will give them: world class striker with lots of pressing and good technique, proven goal scoring abilities.. benched with Argentina the top scorer of Serie A and Inter capitano RemindMe! 10 months RemindMe! 10 months RemindMe! 10 months RemindMe! 10 months RemindMe! 10 months RemindMe! 10 months He has the quality to get 20 goals in the league but I wouldn't underestimate the amount of space he won't be given in La Liga way less open then the prem teams are very rigid and defensive and have been perfecting it for about a decade or more due to having to deal with the likes of prime Ronaldo, Messi, Suarez and Bale for about a solid decade. Would be a great signing, and would mean that Atleti has Spain's starting CB partnership Might be a hot take, but I’d put him in midfield. Right in front of the defence. It's just how football works. I had already made peace with the idea of Hancko leaving us. It's just annoying that it isn't being done quickly. Alvarez Bobb will play false 9 This is how all clubs work though. So you can't claim that city don't hold players hostage compared to other clubs if the only argument is they sell when their valuation is met. He’s 24 with 16,000 senior minutes. Why do people treat him like he’s a child full of promise?   He’s a good, functional player. He’s not a superstar. It always baffles me the way neutrals decide to overrate/underrate some City players, but the fuss over Alvarez is always the most bizarre.  There’s genuinely 10/15 players in our squad I’d be more upset about leaving than Alvarez. I know that sounds spoiled as fuck given he’s obviously a good player, and I’m not trying to downplay that, but he’s not as special as some of you seem to think. Still doesn’t make him world class lol he’s still just potential at this point. Is the pre-requisite for a striker being world class these days “be better than Arsenal’s striker right now”, or something? haaland, watkins and isak are top 3. like quite clearly. Julián Álvarez, one of the top three strikers in the Premier League? Have you ever actually watched a Premier League game outside of Manchester City? I rate Alvarez but naming him as the third best striker in the prem is a laughable offence He isn’t the third best striker in the league Nonsense, he definitely wasn't playing as a second striker.   He was literally playing next to Akanji at some points of the season. He was behind Foden in midfield a lot of the time. > He played as a second striker.  He didn't. City's system didn't have a second striker.  City's possession structure was a very clear 3-2-5. Alvarez mostly played the half-space/pocket role along with Foden. Nah, that's when they saw how much Arsenal was paying for Havertz. Do you really think removing Alvarez from City will have the same sort of impact as removing Solanke from Bournemouth for both respective clubs? But I'm sure the narrative was that he played those minutes because KdBs hamstring (or whatever it was) ... Blew up! Alvarez has basically said this with why he wanted to go.   He also technically played out of position during the KdB injury and then demonstrated that he's incredibly versatile.   Atleti is buying the player he ""was"" before the KdB injury (a damn good prospect at the 9 with his movement and someone who's developed a high degree of versatility to offer the XI). You seriously think Alvarez is more important for City than Solanke is for Bournemouth? that's why he's leaving before fulfilling his 5 year contract lmao I think you are definitely top  of the list!! Expand on that People forget how many minutes he's been playing, he must be tired as shit, he played a lot for MCFC (though only because of injuries, mainly KDB and in less important matches at times), played Copa America/friendlies and Olympics.  He needs a break to catch his breath, he's running all the time. The 1st people to call the Ballon d’or a clown show are always the 1st to use it as the most legitimate metric for judging how a player is “rated” Yeah I think people think you're calling him shite when you see ""over rated"".  Personally think he's a striker that could be world class in a couple of years but he's not at that level just yet. So you are implying that Julian Alvarez was the 7th best player in the world last year? Gallagher is levels below Alvarez as a footballer, you will see, though maybe not if you can’t already He was out of form for the second half of last season, but it's always easy to tell the difference between a class player that's out of form and a player that's actually bad. He started finding his footing towards the end of the season again too, and he's been fantastic during the rest of his time here.  Unless Simeone coaches his will to play football out of him, Alvarez is going to be one of the top strikers in Europe for the next many years. Hahahahahaha are you just calling Alvarez an okay player? Man putting Alvarez and conor in the same comparison >You're literally in this thread insinuating 70m is a bargain  Show me where I said that. I said that the market is fucked because you have much worse players than Alvarez being valued at 70M  >100m on Alvarez and Conor Gallgher. Good grief what a huge sum of money on two incredibly just okay players.  Since you have an England flair, I would have thought you would be used to seeing much worse. It is the land where Caicedo is worth 120M after one season at Brighton, where Solanke is valued at 70M, where Elliot fucking Anderson goes for 40M. Compared to all that we are getting decent value for money I would say RemindMe! 365 days Yes, before Atleti were linked with him I thought Julian fucking Alvarez was terrible. Winning a world cup as starter? Quality numbers for Man City despite being second choice? Great performances for River Plate? Fuck that, clearly a shit player Perfect summation, he’s not world class Well if passing ability and dribble are necessary to be world class, Haaland is out then. For one, the contract length matters. That's why I put that in the comment. City don't *have* to sell at all, at least not for a couple years, if they don't want to.   Second, strikers don't grow on trees. If one becomes available that's ""proven"" they're gonna go for a lot of money. We aren't in 2010 anymore mate Based on the fact that any half decent player with a pulse is worth that these days?  Dominic Solanke is valued around that lmao See how much they paid for Joao Felix I think we are insistent on not selling to rivals again, as well. I’m sure he’s had many suitors Who would pick Tottenham over Atletico?.. Only if you are English or a childhood supporter Bruh, Liverpool get a cut from whatever Solanke is sold for, why are you all over this thread shitting on people signing him We've spent shit-all for the past 5 years. Robin Le Normand is our first CB signing signed for money since Mario Hermoso and Felipe in 2019. Our top transfer fee paid since 2019 is 35,0m for de Paul. The club isn't broke, the club has literally tried everything to not spend money until it became overly apparent that the squad was in decay, and have to actually spend the money they make as a top-20 earning club in the world. our net spend is super low so i wish that were true We're not fan-owned nor do we have any say in how the club is run. It took the club about 8 years to return to the popular old badge, and that's only because the retro shirts sold out constantly.   Most socios are just season-ticket holders with a cool card + a few free games (except you can't go to any UCL, Barcelona or Madrid games). You get like 20% discount at the club store, too. Nacho signed with Atleti? Don't be ridiculous, Pep will simply invent the new tactic of the false Alvarez. Not really. City don't put ""fuck off"" prices on players if they want to leave. I mean city hasn't asked for more than like £70m for Bernardo whenever he wanted to leave, which is more than fair imo Not really lol psg certainly holds players hostage (mbappe, verratti, etc) I guess we never set a “fuck off” price for our players. I don’t know if there is any sale you can say we fleeced the other team. It’s all be decent value for both sides. Alverez is a quality player but hes not the type of player for a Pep system imo. He will kill it at Aleti. IMO he’s overrated because of the World Cup. People put too much importance on it when so many players that shined at the World Cup have been stinking it up on club level since. Not saying he has but his performances at City doesn’t warrant being labeled world class. Isak is not better than Alvarez. Doesn’t have the goal tallies, the assist, doesn’t have international accomplishments. Osaka a great player but not world class yet. Why are you gonna rank him? Behind isak as well? Who else? Throw in solanke? toney? Lol. Clearly. But only one persons put forward a name. Who I’m happy to admit is probabky as good as Alvarez… but after him where? That’s just his game. It’s always been his game. He comes deep to get the ball. You can literally see in the screenshots he heavily occupies the exact same final third area (in red), but spends time in all areas of the pitch. Unless you want to tell me we signed a midfielder from River?   We defend in a 442 block, he was the second striker in the 2. In the build up, he pops up deeper, but in our attacking phase he’s very much a second striker. He’s not a #10 like KdB whose profile is to create, he plays that position like the forward he is. You can say the same about the money. 70m would be way more valuable to Bournemouth than man city Neither City nor Bournemouth finish where they did last season without the respective players.   Both players are important to their clubs. Buddy, City doesn't hold players hostage until their contracts run out if they're unhappy at the club He pressures better than any other forward I've ever witnessed except Suarez in his prime at Liverpool.  The man changes games. or its considered a clown show because of how many players are overrated in the voting... i am implying the ballon d’or rated him as such when he was nowhere near that. Maybe, just maybe, if Simeone wants them both then he thinks they can both play well in the same team?? Crazy idea I know He has played a shitton to be fair, he is a bit upset since he played out of position/less important games in MCFC but he got a lot of minutes, he's played olympics and Copa America/friendlies as well, kid must be tired as shit. Yes. Wonder why you seem to keen to rate him so highly. You'll see soon enough. He's not £70mil worth that's 100% for sure. He's very good, great utility, but not a world beater and probably never will be. Just not elite enough in any key category. I mean, that’s what he was at City, no? Gabriel Jesus tier player with better finishing and less flair. You said 'any half decent player with a pulse is worth [£70m]'  The obvious insinution there is you must think £70m is a bargain no? Solanke isn’t worth 70m, nobody is buying him for that. He’s worth that to Bournemouth because he keeps them in midtable not possibly getting relegated (costing them £100m minimum). Cringe A player can be both really good and overrated. [deleted] But is Julian bagging 40 goals? Yeah one of the scored nearly 20 goals playing for Bournemouth while the other barely scored 10 playing for by far the most dominant side in the league. [deleted] Not really true that though is it. How many players can you name that have gone for 70m+ that were only 'half decent'? Two players can be over-valued at the same time. I'd suggest the worst signing of all time is not a great yardstick to measure other signings by. Also, Jorge Mendes' influence on Atletico paid a big part on that being the fee. I cannot stress enough how much more valuable Felix's profile and skillset is than Alvarez's. It's just that he's played virtually his whole European t5 league career under sub-par managers with sub-par attacking systems.   Like it was an overpay because Atleti had money to burn, but he was not like Antony or something where the talent didn’t match the price whatsoever. If he wanted to stay in England Atleti is the Tottenham of Spain, pretty much ykw good point. lemme switch to hojlund ramos and rkm as reference points. ...and your owners injected money.  The link is literally in the comment chain you responded to, lol Did you guys pay €125m for Joao Felix? le normand-laporte Clearly, you've overvalued bernardo then since no one has bid. Therefore your price is now a fuck off price.  You can't have it both ways >  Doesn’t have the goal tallies  he scored 21 goals in the league last season. alvarez scored 11. you do not know what you are talking about  > doesn’t have international accomplishments.  he’s swedish >Doesn’t have the goal tallies  Not trying to be funny here but are you sure you're talking about the right player here  Julian Alvarez finished 23rd on the top scorers list in the Prem last season. Isak scored 10 more goals than him, and played fewer minutes Isak has double his goals so... A little bit of nuance wouldn’t go amiss Nobody said Alvarez wasn't important to City. And why's he unhappy at the club You’re so close to figuring it out buddy Exactly.   “Here’s a source that I find to be illegitimate and unrepresentative of the soccer community as a whole. It’s only the opinion of a select few whose connections within the game lead them to be biased/compromised.”  “…I think I will use it as the gold standard while discussing the value of players.” Ah sorry I misread the comment, i do agree with you, i find it outrageous that a guy who is not even a certified starter can be 7th on the Ballon dOr list. But the ballondor is not about the best player in the world - it’s ranking performances that season and achievements why do you think your opinion is more accurate than the balon d'or? I think that probably will be the case, but calling Alvarez an “ok player” is laughable I understand not believing he's world-class, but calling him ""just okay"" is insanity, in my opinion. So thinking he is more than ""just okay"" is considering him ""so highly""? Hahaha Hahahahahaha oh my 😂 Any half decent player with a pulse seems to be worth crazy money in England no? Yes, it is a bargain in todays market. Just look at how much players cost and their levels. Where do you get the word bargain from?   It means that I accept that unfortunately in this market you pay 70M for worse players than Alvarez, so getting him for that is good under the circumstances. It is absolutely not a bargain though, it would be very out of touch to call it that It is the obvious insinuation if you want to support your narrative, whether that is remotely close to the truth or not is a different pair of shoes. How do you know that I didn't rate Alvarez before Atleti were linked with him?  It is literally the opposite to to what you are saying. It is people coming out of their crevaces to call him overrated out of nowhere, like they all had saved up their hot takes for this specific moment. I haven't been going ""all out"" to defend him, I just have seen these terrible takes in a few threads and saw it again here, so it was time to call it out once Well he scored 19 goals in all competitions for City last season as a substitute.  Which is why I'm guessing he's so insistent on moving somewhere else to be a starter. Because if he can put up those numbers as a sub, he might be able to do even better as a starter. Tottenham being told the price is 65m is Tottenham being stupid? >Solanke being valued by 65m shouldn't set the tone for the strikers market  That's how the market works Idk, taking another striker for comparison, I'd put Juli at about the same Quality as Nunez with it being hard to compare since they have very different styles and Darwin went for a lot more money, also if this deal was going the other way around you just know atleti would be asking for a way higher fee I'll be the first to say I don't watch Felix enough to refute your argument in any sound way, but if he's not fitting anywhere he goes, one might think that said skillset is not all that impressive man Who would want such a horrible fate? naaahh, Atletico wins stuff, occasionally Yeah, Ramos always seemed like a bad signing to me, as many signings that are done off  int'l tournament hype, had more hopes for RKM but he's probably flopped even harder. The club did this by issuing new shares and then buying 50,0m worth of it themselves, bro, and that 70,0m total is being split across 2 seasons. Our president and CEO are both convicted embezzlers, having suspended prison sentences for embezzling ... from Atleti. It's just one of the two big madrid clubs' people insisting to everyone that they're real, fair clubs, that got to everything they have by their own hard work, as always   Nothing to see here, mate 127,0m  We finished that window with positive net spend btw we have not overvalued bernardo at all lmao Just not how it works. According to Fabrizio, he has a 50 million release clause which he agreed to. That is a completely reasonable price and arguably lower than his worth in todays market  >he’s swedish  Ibrahimovic too If neither team would finish in the same position without the respective players then you can say they’re equally as important. Because he's not a starter and is worried it could impact his chance to start for Argentina in the next WC. Rated, not value.   And yeah, the Balon D'Or is a prominent source for how players are generally rated, even if their ratings don't match our own opinions.   It's the perfect source for if someone is overrated or not. What are you dumb? The Ballon D’or obviously reflects general opinion of the player to some degree. So if he disagrees with the Ballon D’or ranking he also obviously disagrees with Joe highly he is rated. >It’s ranking performances that season and achievements  Aka... who's been playing the best. i don’t think julian alvarez was the 7th best player in the world last season I agree there, he's excellent - would have loved him to go to Arsenal. I think Gallager isn't world class but in the right team he's very effective. I watch literally every single City game. Jesus was also a good player for us, similar work rate, could play anywhere in attack, was always one of our stand out performers in the CL. Alvarez is good, but he’s never going to be Aguero or Haaland level. So in this market... It's a bargain? He wasn't a sub last season, what are you talking about. Yeah, Nunez was a bad signing too but a batter comparison in this case, also Alvarez seems like a much more stable and reliable character than Darwin. Well let's look at where he's been. He's spent the majority of his time at Atleti, who don't really have much use for a player who thrives in condensed situations where his team has a ton of players in and around the box.   He then went to a midtable Chelsea side who were historically bad.  He then went to a Barca side that wasn't particularly well coached, and that wasn't particularly prolific. Like they did not attack with the fluidity and coherence that Barca are known for whatsoever.  Now obviously I don't know how he is to coach, nobody but his coaches know that, but I do he's never really had an opportunity to play football in a place that suits him. The vast majority of footballers? Also 180m injected in 2021.  Obviously Atletico is not City or Chelsea level of financial doping but it's still a club with billionaire backing, not some plucky little underdog that only spends what it earns. Those type of clubs don't have the cash to waste 120m on Joao Felix without going broke If you are tired of embezzlers, we can send in Barto. That will  bring lots of entertainment to you. And that’s exactly why Ibra’s international accomplishments pale in comparison to his accomplishments on the club level It’s a very black and white view of football you’ve got and I cannot follow it one step lol That's just an assumption you're making, here let me make one up - Bournemouth without Solanke would've finished in the relegation zone and City without Alvarez would have still won the league.   Therefore Solanke is more important.  If you don't want to use critical reasoning to understand that a small team losing the 4th top striker in the league would struggle more than the team that has won the title 5 out of 6 times in the last years losing someone they have frequently played out of position, I can't help you. That’s *absurd*. If say a team that finishes 4th would get relegated without one player and another team that finishes 2nd would finish 3rd without another the importance of the players is WILDLY different. And hence, quite obviously, “not as important to city as Solanke is to Bournemouth” And solanke is our star striker...  So we have  >Because he's not a starter   Vs   >star striker   Ergo, Solanke is more important to Bournemouth than Alvarez is to Man City Didn't he start like 30 games last season I am dumb but I’m not rude and certainly not interested in engaging with people who enter conversations so aggressively. A good deal under the circumstances is not the same as a bargain. A bargain would be getting Alvarez for 20M Fair enough, just for curiosity sake, which team would you say it's a nice fit for him? If you compare yourself to premier league teams in terms of spending you are always the plucky underdog, even if you billionaire owner who inject the cash City do not win the league without Alvarez. Hope this helps. only due to injuries + he was shoehorned at kdb position/wings a few times which is clearly not what he wants  when the ""first XI"" was fit he was on the bench Could have been 50+ And in many big games, he didn't start. His competition in the Argentina national team is Lautaro Martinez, so 30 starts may be too little for him. It ain’t deep City, ironically. He's a quite similar player to Phil Foden on profile. Not quite as talented, but ball sticks to his feet in tight areas, stronger than he looks on it, can strike the ball really well with minimal space, see cute passes inside to link play and create chances.   Any team that has the ability to really condense play in their opponents third, get lots of men forward and control the game. Better Bayern teams would have been great for him too. Yes they would’ve won the league with Alvarez. You’re truly bizarre. Sounds like an unimportant player.  Atletico's being fleeced lol"
"[David Medina] Atletico Madrid insists that Samu Omorodion’s €15m sale to Porto was needed to balance the books & meet LaLiga’s FFP rules. Samu has scored as many goals as Griezmann, Julian Alvarez & Alexander Sorloth combined (7). Atleti signed Alvarez & Sorloth for €95m & €32m respectively. ","2024-10-06T19:24:06+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fxojkv/david_medina_atletico_madrid_insists_that_samu/","[No textual content]","2096","Task_Force-191","https://www.marca.com/futbol/atletico/2024/10/04/66fffbfcca47412a068b456c.html","No buy back is criminal I mean everyone who watched Samu last season knew that he's special. The fact that someone at the club decided that 'Sorloth' is worth Samu + another 15 million is fucking insane and in the long run it will look even worse as Samu develops into one of the best strikers in the world I have no clue how we nailed him, but Nico is the true star of our club. Hopefully Barca has no interest/money to buy him back But the money they spent on Alvarez tho... Boehlynomics going global Hindsight is 20/20.   I personally would have loved to keep Samu and give him a proper run in the team, but 2 months ago I was super excited with the signings of Julian, Sorloth and Gallagher. Losing Samu to balance the books was a compromise that I, and most of the fans I talked to, were perfectly happy to do.  I know Marca loves to stir some shit, but 2 months ago no one would have predicted for Samu to turn into a world beater in a matter of weeks. I mean no offence but he's scoring in the Portuguese league and against Man United  He had 8 in 34 in La Liga.. he looks like he will be a good player but still Crazy to see big clubs throw around this much money in one sitting. 127 mil would literally revolutionize the entire landscape of the Eredivisie if you pumped it into the league. The comparison doesn't make any sense but he sure seems to be a great player. Alvarez for 95m will be another addition to the list of the worst deals in history. Everybody was justifying that fee as well. Yes it's early, but never in a million years will he ever be worth that. I don't care. Atletico has massively overpayed for alvarez It's weird really. We loan Conceicao for 7 million!! and then Porto buy Omorodion 15m after 30+ million move to Chelsea had failed. A Benfica fan explain in a thread that Mendes was behind those transfer. Currently, Juve and Aletico are doing Mendes a favor. Later, Mendes will do some favor to both clubs. He says this kind of deal happens a lot, especially in Portuguese league. I don't know if it's true, but if it is, then agent has too much power nowadays. If you're gonn argue Madrid should've kept him it should be an indictment at buying Sorloth not Alvarez tvh One plays in Portugal (with all due respect) and the others in La Liga. If you're gonn argue Madrid should've kept him it should be an indictment at buying Sorloth not Alvarez tbh Yeah Atlético are cooked samu player like 8 games or so, chill Does Porto play the same way Atletico play tho? Cause maybe he benefits more on Porto's playstyles then Cholo's parking bus. 🤔 Its not like they need him. Those are 3 great players, Porto would start all of them too.  Happy to finally have a striker that can make a difference. I don’t understand. Didn’t they turn down multiple ~£35M offers from Chelsea and West Ham? What a waste of money The 15 million € is apparently for 50% of Samu’s sporting rights but they gave an option to take it to 80% by paying another 5 million € next summer. Complicated deal. Nevertheless it doesn’t make a lot of sense in hindsight. I agree no buyback and in general swapping him for sorloth might not have been the best decisions, sure. But scoring goals in Liga portugal really isn‘t what you should be looking at. I hope no black players goes and plays for this racist ass institution. Racismo FC deserves no talent from outside of what they accept over there Absolutely  Just don't buy sorloth if that's the case Samu will be sold to PL for 70mio plus and then his total transfer fee to Atleti will be around 40-50 mio plus. Brainless deal nevertheless.  Do Atleti have 50% of his rights or 50% sell on fee? That fact is that your delusional club paid 95m for Julian Alvarez.  So stupid. the atlético ultras are running the club We do have a buyback, but it isn’t cheap - 30 mill euros. We also have a 40% sell on clause. Saw reports the club was looking at it though still, but with the influx of midfielders we have in our ranks, I don’t think the club will exercise that buyback option. Wow, really? That’s good to hear - is he playing as a regista, destroyer pivot, b2b? I always really liked him and I’m sure he could make it if he ever came back to Barca but somehow we have an overabundance of midfielders rn when fully healthy Alvarez is a 2nd striker, the issue is sorloth right now is playing without confidence and samu there would've been better which is what atleti fans are saying They got absolutely hoodwinked by the state owned financial dopers into thinking they were getting something semi decent when all they were buying was a shit Damarai Gray It's the same club that spend €100m+ on Joao Felix. Yeah there’s a lot of hindsight bias with this. People acting like it’s crazy that Atletico went for Sorloth with his 23 goals in 34 games (0 penalties) to play him over Samu who scored 9 in 35 last season.   Obviously you can debate selling him and his age and potential but for the right now it would definitely seem like Sorloth was a better option.   There’s also no guarantee Samu would do as well as he is at Porto for Atletico which would have course have lead to comments like oh why didn’t Atletico sign a more experienced striker.  It truly is. Also Portos playing style suits him! If you thought signing Alvarez for 90m was exciting i'm not sure what to tell you. That's astronomical money that should be reserved for utterly world class players who'll take a team to another level, and he's not that in the slightest. Fluke season for Sorloth >I mean no offence but he's scoring in the Portuguese league and against Man United  Unsuspecting United fans catching strays even in the most unlikely threads. There is no escape ☹️ Wonder what happened when Atleti played a portuguese side earlier this month... He wouldn't have scored if he went up against a real defender like slabhead Atletico lost 4-0 against the current 3rd best Portuguese club lol >he's scoring in the Portuguese  You think it's easier to score in the Portuguese league, where 14 teams start the tournament with the objective of not being relegated, than in the Spanish league?   How cute. That’s the thing people never seem to notice understand, some leagues are far far weaker than others. Bagging 15 goals in the Premier League is far more impressive than doing it in leagues like Serie A or the Bundesliga and even less so in lesser leagues like Liga NOS or the Eredivisie.  is this a reference to Ajax’s transfer dealings in the summer of 22 🤔 RemindMe! 6 months The Chico Conceição deal is easy to explain - his father (Sérgio Conceição) had just left after 6 years as our coach, and we appointed one of his assistants (Vitor Bruno) which immediately caused chaos as Sérgio and the rest of his staff all screamed ""traitor"" at Vitor Bruno.  The kid didn't sit on the sidelines on this one, which meant he would be toxic / problematic to work with. So despite a great season, hype, playing in the Euro, and being highly rated, we offloaded him on the cheap. why did his move to chelsea fail? Sørloth is a really good striker, I think he was a ""safer bet"" before the season began. I think he will still settle in and score more as the season progresses.  He looked on fire for Norway last international break against Austria aswell You really didn't use Madrid for Atleti, did you Atletico got thrashed by a Portuguese club last week? Both are currently sitting third in their respective  league. 3/7 goals are in Europa League, including 2 against Man United TBF Not to mention they just got signed, still decent amount of stuff to cover before you start the critique no matter how expensive they cost. Chelsea agreed with Atleti on the fee. There were issues agreeing his contract and possible medical issues depending on what rumors you trust.  That said, Chelsea scouting dept look like striker geniuses at the moment. Tried to get Duran and Samu in the summer. The way FFP works is weird.  If you sell a player, the amount is already accounted in FFP.  If you buy a player, the cost of the player is ammortized for 5 years (usually, or the number of years they get the contract for).  So, it's not as straightforward. But nevertheless, the transfers are looking brain dead in the hindsight. Porto will have 80% of his rights by the time he gets sold.  So atleti will make 15M +20% of whatever money he gets sold for And Sorloth will be loaned somewhere next season and start banging them in, that's his career summarized Last year he was more of an 8 and was good, but this year he’s playing higher in the field (more offensive and creative) and he’s been absolutely fantastic. He progressed a lot in just one season. He even shoots from outside the box now and shows up in finishing positions often, including headers. He is destroying Liga Portugal. But then again, it's Liga Portugal I swear Sorloth is always playing without confidence. It doesn't matter what Alvarez is. He's not worth close to 90m euros and it'll set Atleti back a long way due to signing him. …? Alvarez is a very good player… and the initial 65 mil was completely fair. no one forced Atletico to spent 45 mil for sortloth… terrible decision they had no chance but overpay, they had sold Griezmann and Rodri that same summer for 200m, everyone knew they were flush with cash, and lacked a franchise player Indeed, also, we have to remember the signing of Sorloth comes after selling Morata, who was one of our top scorers last year.  We needed an established striker, and Samu was perceived as a bright prospect, not an immediate solution. Alvarez is so overrated. He was pretty average and among the worst of City's attackers every time he started last season, both behind Haaland and instead of him. He is a decent player but nowhere near worth 90 million. Is a thread about a player who recently scored against you an unlikely place thread to be mentioned. Yeah, it's not really a good excuse Or Jonny Evans MBE Not sure what your point is. It'll obviously be easier to score for a team like Porto if 14 other teams are relegation challengers (which means the gulf between them and the top teams is higher than it would be in the Spanish league) .. yes. I think scoring against worse teams with a better team is easier. I play my local amateur team, everyone plays to stay in that league. I think if we put Alvarez in there he’ll score half a dozen goals a game as well. Bas Dost put up Haaland numbers in your league. Be real with yourself >Bagging 15 goals in the Premier League is far more impressive than doing it in leagues like Serie A or the Bundesliga  Found the guy who only ever watches the Premier League and literally nothing else. Some PL fans are truly deluded That's not the point you should be making. You should really be emphasizing the fact that he scored 8 in 34 last season.    Good deal for Porto tho  🤢 There's not a single universe where he'll ever live up to his transfer fee so i'm not sure what you'll need a reminder about. guy has scored what, 2? Wanna put some money on that? Lol He failed the medical > including 2 against Man United  So no harder than scoring in Liga Portugal what's so special about scoring against a club in a relegation battle I was at the game on Thursday and scoring against De Ligt was not exactly the most challenging thing that Samu will ever have to do in his career. There's a chance I would score against United so please don't bring them up as a reference of any player being good Both of whom West Ham also wanted. Duran was close but Villa kept dicking around on the fee. They look like geniuses now, but both the club and supporters wanted rid of him badly. That’s not weird, it’s just normal accounting Wdym “weird”?? It always astounds as to how the popular opinion regarding what I consider to be ""normal"" is that it's ""weird"".   How do you people budget your lives if not this?  How fucking old am I at 30? I swear this past month has been an increase of the number by 1 but feels like that of a decade. wow, worse than I thought. They got rinsed. Bravo Porto but what are they paying Atleti for that extra 30%? >So atleti will make 15M +20% of whatever money he gets sold for  Don't forget that Porto still has to pay for those 30%, it won't be 0€. Doesn’t that imply they need to be able to hold onto him for 2 more seasons. That’s unlikely  I think he was good for the first 4 games but after the game against rayo where he missed 3 clear chances and ruined some counter attacks it went downhill for him.Last 4 games he played so bad he cant even do linkup plays/press defenders anymore Because he is a typical confidence player, Villareal was the perfect low pressure environment for him, he's only been good at these types of clubs Said it for a while, but he is literally ferran 2.0. Was annoyed because it gave city a big out on a player pep never trusted in the big games. But then I realized money is irrelevant to city in the current scenario, so got over it. Not sure what it is with Spanish teams and buying overrated players at city for huge sums. a franchise player  This is not the US... Also that sorloth (as far as I know) wasn’t the first option. Dovbyk was All hail Jonathan Grant Evans MBE, savior of the United defence >14 other teams are relegation challengers  That is not what I said at all  It's going to be much harder to score in Portugal when 14 teams will play with 11 men behind the ball Bas Dost would've put numbers close to those in any team feeding him the way we were feeding him. Very specific target man striker but that finishing was not a ""oh, it's just the portuguese league"" type of deal. Borderline useless when asked to do anything else besides staying in the box but that guy was scarily clinical. Reddit like to pretend this is a hot take but ultimately it’s true. Tammy Abraham was shite in the Prem went to Italy and is a God. Players like Dzeko and Giroud are finished at Prem level and 6 years later are still bagging 20 in Italy.  Truly deluded and have been like this since the influx of money. Money makes them think they're better than everyone else. Makes them think their lower teams are somehow better than other leagues' lower teams or some even say better than midtable teams. Nothing to back all this up, except that those clubs are richer than their counterparts, so they must be better.  You must also have seen statements like 'there is no easy game in PL'. So there are easy games in other leagues? Hell no. Italian and Spanish teams are crazy hard to beat. But delusion can't be cured for them unfortunately. They think scoring goals against relegation teams like Norwich and Luton is more difficult than midtable Bundesliga or Serie A. The PL’s quality is often confused for its high athleticism Team is obviously trash, blaming one player is just sad.   Also, I will never understand the hate boner against Alvarez, he's such a nice guy, lol. Plus an issue with his image rights or something. Did he really though? I thought this was a baseless rumour. We beat you last year you numpty Yes, for accounting people.   For normal people like me, it is weird. Weird in the sense, if they didn't sell and get 15m, they would have gotten flagged by FFP.  But because they did, now they can afford 32m.  I don't know about you, but for me, it is weird. found it on google. Xmas came early to Porto. What a gift     The Portista club has retained “two non-mandatory purchase options” for an additional 15% of the player’s rights at a cost of €5 million each. In total, FC Porto could secure 80% of the player’s rights for a combined fee of €25 million. 5 million per each 15% bought True, my bad, 25M +20% We have to buy those 30% until the summer of 2026. We could buy them now if the board chooses to. Something something 115 whatever, however you call a star, high profile player No?  They play with 11 men behind the ball because they are so much worse than the top few teams. The gulf is still bigger than it is between Atleti and midtable La Liga teams, even if they park the bus. The top 2 in the portuguese league scored the same (or more) amount of goals in the league as Barca and Atleti last season with 4 fewer games. Every team in every league plays with the objective of not getting relegated kind of a stupid point I just don’t agree with that. Just look at his numbers even for you when in Europe. He scored a goal every 80 minutes in his best season in the Portuguese league. Haaland scored every 77 minutes in his record breaking season. I remember the horrid defending when a highlight reel of his one touch goal streak was posted too  Do you really think no top club would have snatched him up if his numbers were even somewhat replicable in a top league? Jonas also jumped from scoring around 10 in La Liga to 30 goal seasons Lmao Abraham a God... He's had a better goals per minute ratio in his last two prem seasons than in any of his serie A season. You're confidently ignorant. This works both ways though, plenty of players move to the Premier League and score more goals there than at their previous clubs. Lol, Džeko scored for fun at City. The man bagged 50 Premier League goals in about 7.000 minutes without scoring a single penalty. That's basically better than Harry Kane if you look at non-penalty goals.  And before you go on about why he was not first choice then, I'll answer that preemptively: Because City had one of the best strikers in Premier League history at the time.   Džeko is a terrible example to give. He's one of the most gifted and consistent goalscorers of his generation. [deleted] I'm not blaming Alvarez. Atletico are just stupid and he's not worth 95 million euros > xmas came early   I mean, it was proper scouting and developing the player right now.  15M for 50% of a pass in Portugal is not something that happens everyday.   And Porto is particularly in a tight spot financially so this was kind of a big gamble. I wonder if those options have a time component.  Presumably they wouldn’t be silly enough to allow Porto to exercise that clause immediately prior to a sale. Atleti under Simeone has not been a club that ""needs"" this sort of player just for the sake of it Some aspects of my reply that you're not taking in to be fair. I do believe wholeheartedly that Dost puts impressive numbers in any team if that team is as dominant and consistent in servicing him the way Sporting was. The deal is that dominance wouldn't really be replicated by any team on a top league that wouldn't already have a striker that's just better than Dost at finishing (or comparable in finishing but superior in a plethora of other traits). There is examples in the opposite direction, Alberto Bueno scored 17 goals in LaLiga before joining us and could not do anything in our league. Adrian Lopez also did better in LaLiga with Atletico than he ever did with us. Name one who didn’t go to a better team? 50 goals in 130 is not scoring for fun, in an insanely attacking amazing team too He did yeah he was a fantastic striker. However eventually he got too old and over the hill. Then he went to Italy and it was like he was 25 again. Stupid response. Tbh it's not exactly next level scouting. Everyone in Spain knew Samu was good last season, and then it became clear to the rest of the world when Chelsea very nearly signed him.   The super low fee is just a bizarre combination of Atleti being stupid and desperate. It wouldn't make a big difference, since Porto's financial status is awful and it was a way found without needing to pay big money upfront they definitely learned that lesson The only teams in Europe that even have that mentality are Real Madrid and PSG. Real because they naturally attract the very best and PSG because until recently they were desperate for legitimacy and international name recognition. Adrian Lopez scored 34 in La Liga? Neither of those players ever scored at close to a rate of the ones I mentioned in any league. There’s loads of strikers that can have a 10-15 goal season and fall off right after for a plethora of reasons. There aren’t too many 30 goal strikers in top leagues that fade into obscurity though. Even when Joao Mario or Seferovic were getting 25+ g/a in a season Benfica fans were complaining about them because they know it doesn’t mean as much. Just noticed that Tammy Abraham has a better record for Chelsea than any Italian team he's played for, so not sure he's the best you could have chosen... Don't look at the games played, look at the number of minutes played. Of those 130, Džeko only started 74 and played the equivalent of 79 full matches. So that's 50 goals in 79 full matches. With *no* penalties. Still don't think that's scoring for fun? For reference, if we adjust for all the penalties Kane scored 177 in the minutes equivalent to 292 full matches. In other words, Džeko scored non-penalty goals at a higher frequency than Harry Kane. Again, Džeko is one of the very, very best goalscorers of his generation. Unfortunately, one of his teammates was Sergio Agüero. [deleted] I'm not saying next level, just proper. Porto identified a high potential player in a club that had no space for him and managed to negotiate a low fee.  It's the same thing as when PSG got Vitinha or Arsenal got Fábio Vieira. They were already known in Porto and Champions League but the clubs did good on buying them in a period of time where Porto needed to sell and got them for a low fee taking into account the potential.  And Chelsea signed 11 new players spending almost 200M. They are kind of a meme for having a very extended squad, some of them were even bought and loaned in the same window. If he's selling for enough that 15% is worth more than 5M, you'd only need to borrow the money for a couple of days. That's why just looking at stats is a bad ideia. There is a reason those players were never sold for big money, the scouts watch the games. Any scout watching what Samu did in these games he played for us will be very impressed with him and it's not just ""he's scoring in the Portuguese league"". Gyokeres is an even bigger example, people that watch the games will know how good he is and not just because its Portuguese league. Did they go to Italy and did they then go on to score loads of goals? Yes. So the point still stands.  I mean that’s kind of my point no? It’s easier to score so it takes more than raw numbers to impress. If any player scores 30 in the PL you know he’s the real deal no two ways about it. That’s Salah, Haaland, Kane or CR7 numbers and not Bas Dost"

El Araña lol I just can’t believe that Atlético will cough up what City’ll demand How much would City demand? Would €70-90m enough? Psg seem to have 0 transfer strategy every window Jokes aside would be a great signing for Atleti Genuinely think this lad can become the best striker in the world if put in the correct environment. Hopefully he makes the right choice After today’s reception I don’t see Julian Alvarez being that excited about going to PSG. Who’ll end up being back up to Haaland if he goes? Really sad he's going but its always inevitable.   Am I crazy for thinking he's easily worth €100m+ in this market ? When Havertz and Højlund went for 75m,  Núñez for 80m? Is the offer to city or Julian ?   I saw reports that his representatives were in Paris One side of me is like, cool another good player leaving city. But the other side is like, shit they’ll easily have 60-90m to just throw around in the market. Anywhere but PSG My dream striker for Barcelona and there are no links to us at all 🥺 Would be a very good signing for PSG Any top player moving to Ligue 1 is such a let-down At PSG. He can win a lot of trophies and maybe get more money than at Atletico. Also he could be a marquee player for them. And PSG would have more exposure imo.   At Atletico, he would play under Cholo and would be in La Liga which is a better league than Ligue 1.  In either of them, if he acts as an important player to win a UCL, he is gonna become an instant legend though. City have been pretty quiet on the buying end. I’ve assumed it was cause of PSR, but if they sell Alvarez, im also going to assume theyll want to buy another attacker, right? Wonder who theyll go for Can’t even use the right pronoun for his nickname. Boo this journalist So where would he slot in the team? Alongside Sorloth or on the wings? Can't believe he has to compete against another lanky Norwegian for a start in his preferred position. He's my first choice as a striker for PSG Someone please enlighten me with Julian’s ability because I just don’t get it Great thing, he deserves to be more than a super-sub in City. Dumbass click bait. He hasn't left yet, and surely city will bump his contract to keep him I always wanted to see him at Bayern tbh, feel he would be great there. after this olympics performance? Jesus christ DOUBT I SWEAR IF ANOTHER ARGENTINE WASTES HIS CAREER AT ATLÉTICO I would go to PSG in his shoes. Better team, better coach, better long term project. Probably more money too Why would offensive players want to join Atletico is beyond me. I respect their philosophy (most of the time) but this is not where I’d want to be if I wanted to score goals. Why would I French team be in for Alvarez? This sub has told me the French and Argies are mortal enemies. Surely a club like PSG hasn't moved on from it? he walks into every team in the world  the fact he's leaving is proof pep ain't shit Wonder if that means we're signing Omorodion Swear that boy is the most anti climactic player… I beg of you please take him He aint Undav but it should be fine. Would be a banger to watch him live in our game vs you guys in a couple weeks Come to FCSB, if I have to watch Miculescu play one more game I will riot (Daniel Popa doesn’t seem much better but at least he is a new signing so I am not fed up with him yet) Why is a German tier 1 for Argentina? Will this be the end of Spiderman? El Rata Alada El hombre que araña la araña El aracnido la arana discoteca We just spent close to 40M on Le Normand, we offered 40M for Dovbyk and currently are negotiating separate 40M deals for Sørloth and Gallagher  And all this is after getting big salaries off the books. Atleti are the 12th or 13th richest club on earth they can definitely afford it Atletico have not been shy to spend big money  Some Argentinian sources indicate a deal is close at 70+20M Most likely. Any more and it would price him out which would be fair to due given the length of his contract and his quality but, as always, we’re willing to let players go that ask That's an hillarious price Hopes prayers and baguette He's their target IMO. A clutch goalscorer is they need to replace mbappe fuck it we ball isn’t a strategy? Back to strikerless Probably foden and bobb as false 9. With savio coming we have enough players for front 3 positions You assume Pep must play a traditional center forward. Do check how we played in 20-21 and who was our top scorer they won a few EPL without strikers . Haaland isn't going anywhere. We gave you Agüero, Rodri and Demichelis, now is your turn to return the favour. I mean those were shockingly high fees to be fair, 70+20 seems reasonable Nunez ceiling is higher for physicallity reasons alone. That said, his floor is a lot lower. I think the same could be said about Hojlund. 70m+20m seems fair for Alvarez No he's not... He's greatly talented but he's not better than Nunez.... Nunez's Benfica time> Alvarez's City time I don´t think we are buying anyone, almost no rumours this summer. Would propably need to be panic buy or perfectly kept secret. Why? He could win ton of trophies and awards there. Plus, it's a superteam. Easy for him to score goals then I am surprised they didn't link him to Barcelona knowing they have no 9 for season 25/26.   He seems like the kind of striker that thrives in Barcelona  If only Barca could sell someone....?? I think we all know he’s going to go to the most competitive league… Which is the Canadian Premier League PSG project is over so top players should avoid Ligue 1. Don't @ me. You know I'm fucking right. Saying that while the league is the most competitive its ever been since QSI is comical However, PSG treated 2 legends like messi and neymar really really bad, so I don’t see any argentinian moving there for a while It’s a win win for him really. I think the chance to break up the Barca-real Madrid control over la liga, as well as challenge for UCL is more enticing than dancing your way to a Ligue 1 title. Either way he can be a main man, work under a Spanish speaking coach. Nah we're good on PSR rules. We've made quite a pretty penny selling academy prospects recently. Txiki and Pep just think the current squad must be good enough. With Mascherano as coach, even real madrid would be relegated to B League lol He did it on purpose so that City accepts a lower sum of money Which Argentinian wasted his career at Atlético? SIMEONE CANT KEEP GETTIGN AWAY WITH THIS I don’t think Luis Enrique is a better coach than Simeone.  What Simeone has done with Atletico over the years is extraordinary.  I don’t think Luis Enrique would’ve done that. Why is this downvoted? Atleti have played much less defensively the last few seasons. Since 2019-2020 where they finished 3rd with only 51 goals scored (7th when you rank teams by goals scored), here has been their record... they've scored ~1.78 goals per game:  Season | League Finish | Goals Scored | Goals Scored Rank | Teams Ahead of Atleti in terms of Goals Scored ---|---|----|----|---- 2023-2024 | 4th | 70 | 4th | Real Madrid, Barcelona, Girona 2022-2023 | 3rd | 70 | 2nd | Real Madrid 2021-2022 | 3rd | 65 | 3rd | Real Madrid, Barcelona 2020-2021 | 1st | 67 | 2nd | Barcelona Wtf? What? The average psg fan likely kisses the ground Di Maria walks on, so I'm not sure about that He does not walk into every team in the world lol. Hes a good player but I think he’ll flop badly Why Would it mean that? Completely different player types why would that mean anything to you? Reminds me of the hype around Bojan. Honestly feel bad for both players. The agents/clubs create the hype What’s wrong with Felix?  And does Barcelona not want him? I thought he did well there.  I’m so out of touch lmao Wasnt the Undav deal cancelled? Seeing the curent conflicts the argentinians have during the Olimpics he'd feel right at home in special when playing the 2 Craiova teams. Hopefully not family history no habla espanol fellas?! URL Alvarez took 115 Spanish lessons and it wasn’t enough. Is he stupid? Miau “Abuela sabes cómo me saco el condon?” Tu telaraña me la paso por los webos I mean I think it’s the 80 mil outlay for Gallagher and sortloth that’s causing confusion. Surely they can’t sign all 3. Especially without Felix sale Thats part of the reason. You already have spent 40M on Le normand and pretty sure with the numbers quoted or somewhere close you will get the other 2 players (i dont follow atleti transfers so im taking your words at face value 100%) you will have spent 120M. I dont think city will let him leave for less than 70 so if we ballpark it to 75 you will have spent 195m which is a lot of money for a club which is what makes it less believable. BVB is about as rich and they always act like they're poor and don't have any money to spend lol Gallagher and Julian would be really great signings for you guys. Le Normand is also top. Not really, the times they do have generally been when they made good transfer income. Look at their net spend, it's positive in most seasons. Completely fair to me from Citys perspective. Interesting that Atletico would go that high although I really believe he's perfect for them. [removed] Haaland has asked to leave please let him go It’s a lot of money for such a young player. But at the same time, I really don’t know if there are any other players out there we would want instead of him that wouldn’t cost more. Why? Think Atletico are getting a steal? You butthurt that you can’t even get 20m for McSauce?? I can even see O’Rielly there, he can play from DM up to False 9. A plus is that he is around 6 foot plus i think. Mate it was just a question. Lighten up. I mean who will be back up to Haaland if Alvarez goes. Demichelis to City is still the funniest transfer ever You are right, losing club legend Demichelis must have hurt after his long and succesful career at your team. Havertz and Hojlund were sold by teams that need the money to two of the richest PL teams. City doesn't need the money and are very reasonable about letting players leave, and Atletico is rich but not United/Chelsea rich. I think Pep's contract situation will also impact the recruitments , he's as imp of a factor to join City as the club itself Hahaha nice sarcasm The french league is not at all competitive. He would waste his career, like Neymar if he went there. Who is dumb enough to leave sunny Barcelona and new Camp Nou on huge wages to join Saudi clubs? of couse its a barca fan claiming that The tv deal and economic issues say otherwise This may be true if you disregard the existence of PSG lmao The way Neymar left was bad but I wouldn't say he was disrespected throughout his career. We also have to understand that he was (and is) the most expensive player of all time. He was bought specifically for the UCL and hence there will be pressures.  As for Messi, yeah, agreed. However I feel it turned so bad after the WC. They pandered to Neymar especially for years what on earth are you talking about.  What about El Fideo ? He is worshiped over here. Messi came here as a mercenary, purely for money (instead of staying with the club that he pretends to love so much but for which he would even reduce his salary), and used the club as a gym to prepare for the World Cup. He received as much as he gave, which is a fat paycheck in return for his presence. And I don't care that he's the greatest player ever (which he is), I want players willing to die (figuratively) for PSG and give joy to the fans. Those who don't want to do that, fuck off.  Cavani, on the other hand, that was a fucking shame and disgrace (but what can you expect with our shit owners). Why? No one told Messi to just score 6 league goals and shit the bed in UCL most. He was walking and acting, completely clueless.  Haha didn’t even notice. Yeah you know.. Arab club bad. The old stuff. Oh well, look at that, trusting my bias without checking and being corrected, that’ll teach me. Sarcasm. Bojan scored like crazy in the youth teams, breaking Messi’s record. That’s where the hype came from. That’s barca and Spanisgh media.  His move to Italy wasn’t the right one for him. Imho he did well at Ajax except for scoring a lot and at Stoke I remember he did well until his injury.   Felix got sold for a huge amount unlike Bojan. Bojan created the hype by scoring 12 goals in a season in which he went aged 16. Bojan actually delivered at a very young age though. Felix had one good season in Portugal with Benfica and that’s it. Bojan was genuinely class, he just had issues with injuries and mental health unfortunately.  Looked a cut above for us until that fucking FA Cup tie against Rochdale, was never really the same player after that. 99% or Atlético supporters despise him for being abhorrently disrespectful to the club. The shit this man has said makes me furious. He is but a feeble minded disloyal whiny pathetic waste of oxygen. He was just fine. Not good enough to warrant a transfer fee and the wage he'd demand. I'm sure if Barca had the money they'd rather spend it on Nico He was okay for us. Not worth what Atletico wants for him. So we arent interested. Hence why Alvarez instead I mean if it s conflicts we are after we ve had one with CSA for years nevermind the classic rivalries, no need to involve Craiova into it (and Mititelu s just went down anyway so we can only meet in the cup). Rotaru s does have an Argentinian to help him settle in though but no Europe anymore, think the Champions League is more attractive than that (thanks Maldonado for the red). And then there is Becali that s always good for anti-LGBT rants and all. Also we have quite a few black players now, hope they wouldn’t mind that Argentinian chant video if he was to come are we sure his last name isn’t really gröver 👀 Schweinerbauer, und Schneider. :3 Soplame la vela No idea what they are capable of to be honest, they have been saving for years whilst spending on infrastructure. Just approved a 70M financial injection aswell They’ll be able to sell Felix. A lot of prem teams can afford him, whether he wants to go there or not is another thing. Gallagher probably isn't going through by the sounds of it and if Atleti got Julian they wouldn't need Sorloth. So both of those 40m quotes would most likely be null if this deal went through. Hopefully they still get Conor but it sounds like he is pushing Chelsea to make a better extension offer. Eternally scarred by that financial crisis Simeone has a solid relationship with the owners and never criticizes their mismanagement. Since they owe their past and continuing success to him he has a lot of capital to influence these decisions even though he doesn’t always get involved and has sometimes been stuck with players he doesn’t want. I’m sure he has been pushing for this hard since Alvarez put it out in the media that he wanted a transfer. Really 70 is a bit wild but then again it’s inflated and he does have a mountain of trophies already but he’s usually not even first pick for city but then again he’s fairly young Is it? Technically yes, but if you have no replacement you are fucked Pep wants to retire like Klopp No. They'll get 30 I don't even want him sold but sure, try again. Well it was a sincere response, not sure why you’re offended He was actually solid for us (until he wasn’t lol) >he's as imp of a factor to join City as the money itself  Ftfy Messi was even one of the best players at PSG performance wise his 2nd season, and even defended and tracked back more than Mbappe yet he still got called out for walking You must have lived under a rock If you dont remember How Messi and Neymar got scapegoated the same el fideo who wanted to stay and had a verbal agreement to stay but was ultimately forced out of the club? lmao...  yes the psg fans love him, but the management betrayed him.   https://www.reddit.com/r/psg/comments/urt4mr/le_parisien_angel_di_maria_feels_furious_and/ I will never forgive PSG for how they treated Cavani either He couldnt stay with Barcelona even for free due to financial far play. Messi was the dumbest transfer to PSG ever dude is a straight fraud goat my ass. I really hate the fucking Qataris for damaging my club like this I think its more of the way psg has treated messi and the ongoing beef between arg and france that would make it a bad move to go to psg nope just not that funny Half a season even Felix was arguably the best place in Atleti’s last title winning season?  What do you dislike about him Fuck no lmfao even if we had the money we would only take him on loan not even a free transfer we don't even want his wages He's not helping us beat the allegations. Größer Junyan Nyalvaréz I think the intention is to have 2 strikers so Sorloth and Alvarez would play together in their system But then again his competition is Haaland but then again he also played loads last year but then again it is up to him to decide what he wants can't force him to stay but then again I love him Apparently Pep is looking at Oscar Bobb or Foden as back up 9s. I hate it. So please extrapolate your point. That was what my reply was an invitation to do. Agree. For just €25m extra, they could have gotten someone like Anthony. Apologies. Sounded like you were trying to be sarcastic. My bad. Yeah players join Arsenal for charity He did not defend bruh stop kidding yourself just because its messi Messi did nothing for PSG the only purpose signing him was for marketing and brand exposure. Neymar was amazing for PSG when he played because he was injured so much his lifestyle choices and how he treated his body is all on him and greatly impacted his career and legacy. [deleted] It's not an open secret that management, fans, and ultras are three different camps Even if that was the case, he could have signed a contract and left on a transfer. It's not as if the Qatari wouldn't have thrown bags of golds at Barça's feet to get him. It's ok, I'm just trying to bother the English and Americans who have been projecting the past month. was his best season for them, but he def wasn’t their best player No he wasn’t Brother he just explained it in a whole paragraph. But why male models? I believe long term the idea is for Julian to replace Grizzi and act as a stop gap up top for Morata and Memphis departing. They have Samu back from loan along with Carlos Martin, so they aren't short on bodies and have a lot of talent. It also looks like Felix isn't going anywhere so I definitely don't see them pursuing both targets, at least not this window. Not about that about atleti possibly overpaying 70+20 seems wild I don't want Julian to go but honestly if its either or, I'd prefer we do false 9s as back up to Haaland and then finally get a proper backup for Rodri because fuck me if we're doing another season without one after he keeps telling everyone he's getting burnt out, we're not gonna have a prime Rodri for very long I’ve seen very little of oscar bobb but he looks amazing and definetly seems to have that scoring sense Bobb as backup 9?? :S  Surely that must at least be some kind false 9 shenanigans?  I mean as a Norwegian I love Bobb, but I certainly can't see him playing as a striker tbh. God pls no more Foden false 9 I'm so sick of it, we gave it a season and it clearly didn't work. It's too much for a player who's surplus and wants out. Totally missing out Good for you the original comment was   >PSG treated 2 legends like messi and neymar really really bad  it never specified fans only. di maria was treated badly by the management No, there was no way for him to sign any contract, cheap or expensive, with Barcelona. That was my joke. I forgot the sub I posted in. Mods, please add the /s Bobb is the type of player that can play anywhere in an offensive role Don’t let your dislike of city blind you from the facts Not surplus, is young, is a world champion, is on a long contract, is actually really good.   Also City have shown with Bernado that they are capable of keeping a player who wants out happy for a very long time. That kind of thing will mean Julian will not be pushing as hard as he would if the club was different.   And that's if the story is true. He played 36 of 38 Premier League games last season. 31 as a starter. Most of any City player. Who’s also the 2nd best striker in the Prem… My bad, I misunderstood For real? Barto really fucked, didn't he? Hahahahahahahahahaha it's so funny, ""/s"" damn that joke was so good youre hilarious man hahahahah. Okay? The amount of incompetence and corruption in his time is truly unbelievable. You both ""Suck"""

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Aaaahh fuck, I can't believe you've done this! I know it doesn't matter for the handball rules, but that shot was going into Row Z  Edit: for the record, I think this is a handball. It's been mostly consistent in the Prem this year that they are likely to call it if you have your hands raised above your shoulder like that. Are Man City getting another fine for surrounding the ref when they pressured him for the penalty? He books Pickford for that, but doesn't do anything about the 6 City players crowding the ref I assume all the city players will be booked for crowding the referee or no? Can someone explain to me why the benchmark for handball changes literally every single week? Every City player throwing their hands up appears to have worked Another r/soccer thread that should remind you not to take 90% of opinions here seriously because people’s biases make them delusional. i don't get it, it hits is arm that its extended, in the box, it was a shot at goal (doesn't matter if it was high) but not a penalty according to you lot? I thought players were supposed to be punished for crowding the ref? So VAR official David Coote found out what a handball is in the last week after not penalizing Odegaard playing basketball against Liverpool seems consistent that idk if im just biased against city, but surely that was about to hit his head if his arm didnt exist? How is this a pen and the one on Odegaard isn’t? Close range, hands in natural position. I swear I’ve seen this kind of handball not given almost every other Prem game Genuinely what’s he supposed to do? Dive in with his arms by his sides? I don’t get the rules anymore such a harsh pen what the fuck is onana supposed to do there he is fucking diving onto the ground https://media4.giphy.com/media/4KFjJmTGav0QoE5WDk/giphy.gif Too bad Everton, should have dribbled it. David Coote joining the chat with another absolute howler From what I understand this is supposed to be how the new handball rule works… which is to say, it’s a fucking terrible implementation. Violent flashbacks to Rodris handball in this fixture Does anyone here know if it's a natural or unnatural position? What are the current rules for this type of incident? Insanely harsh penalty to give, he was trying to control himself while going to ground for a challenge.   City get those 50/50 decisions every day and twice on Sundays. Onana hasn't made himself bigger. no clue why this is a pen Literally only one team gets this call and they get it again. It’s exhausting. Typical City pen Liverpool no pen vs arsenal though i thought its not a pen if you are falling down? I dont understand how pens are given out so easily when they are essentially a free goal. Not a fan of that being given. It’s that or get blasted in the face, but then again this is City we’re talking about so I’m not too surprised with the decision. Seriously believe the referee doesn’t give that without all those appeals. That’s the sort of penalty only one team in the league gets given >No penalty   >City crowds the ref and screams   >Penalty Corruption. Fuck this league. this is a penalty but Arsenal defender brushing the ball away from Salah is “just putting his hand for balance” gifting another win to the darlings of the prem execs pockets The kind of penalty that City seem to get an abundance of. May be a pen but kinda funny how the ref waited until the city players surrounded him I’ve seen enough, accidental handballs should be indirect free kicks instead of penalties Why is this a handball Compared to the 100's that wasnt given No other team in the prem gets these calls I swear VAR should look more into it before giving it. City pressures the ref to give it…. Shouldn’t be a pen but City players screamed loud enough for it, reffing in this league is pathetic Natural position, doesn’t go look at the monitor, stupid That's just not given as a penalty if the team badge is anyone else. Not a pen How was the Romero one against Man United wasn't given as this one was? Completely baffles me how City gets every decision their way. League is completely corrupt. Did they stop considering the distance between where the ball is struck and how close the defenders hand is? Kinda close tbh It’s such bullshit, Onana’s hand was already in front of his face when the ball was kicked Never a penalty. Absolute horseshit call, changed his mind after the players started swarming him. Fuck off corrupt cunts. Pure corruption How is that not a fcking natural position. City gets all the 50/50 calls from the refs City always seem to get away with crowding the ref Onana should have told the ref he slipped Pickford very nearly blocked that with his feet. Bien pateado Juli bow is that a penalty?  he just about to fall off balance hence use his hand to balanced.. just like oldegaard last week against liverpool. must be nice to get obvious handball PKs Idk how anyone is seriously questioning this as a handball lol??? His arm is up away from him in the air... No yellow cards for swarming the ref? Saw Bruno one yesterday for a nailed on yellow for the other guy! Wait so the Odegaard one isn’t a pen but that’s a stone cold pen? I really don’t want to think that shit is rigged but they make it so obvious Here we go again with the most brain dead takes by your average r/soccer users about conspiracy shit. I have seen different sequence which results in penalty in many matches before this. Whether it is by reflexes or not, if your arms were active the refs will give penalties. The most frustrating thing is when the refs will consistently enforce the rules.   Nice penalty by Alvarez though. The salt is incredible, his hand was over his head. Clear dead handball Never a pen Not a pen Never a penalty fuck this league  City players clearly influenced the decision there… Pickford should’ve caught the free kick and the corner Man City and soft as fuck penalties. Name a more iconic duo, I’ll wait. What is the defender supposed to do there. He’s falling, protecting his face, and not making his body bigger? Ridiculous decision again to benefit the oil cheats. Only one team gets these calls. PL is rigged. same guy on var that was var for liverpool vs arsenal. So he thinks thats a pen but odegaards handball isnt. Understandable. Good proces thanks Alvarez for saving my bet 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Bs fucking pem This sub is completely gone lol...mass psychosis in here. So many clowns in this thread. The ref didn't suddenly just change his mind because city players crowded him. The assistant gave it.  Also it's a blatant penalty. Yell at the ref until he gives a pen. Cheat code unlocked I know this sub has a hate boner for City but how are you gonna argue about this stonewall pen? What’s wrong with this thread lol. ""why does nobody like city!?""   Lol These comments are insane… his arm is away from the body, at head level. If this subreddit can’t agree that this is 100% a handball in every game in every competition, there’s no hope… I get exactly why so many of you hate City, I really do but this thread is embarrassing. We can discuss all day if this SHOULD be a penalty and I might even be swayed but this is 100% consistent with how these have been called. Joke league and joke country, they have sold their soul to the devil for some oil money. [deleted] Very soft. Guess they screamed at the ref enough I feel like logically it should be a pen but the handball rules have been so all over the place this season that I really don’t know how this was given. Flair test One set of rules for city and another for everyone else Love the salt and logic in this thread. Officials didn’t make the right call in previous matches and now they called a rightful pen. Must be paid and totally rigged! Why are people surprised city and Newcastle don't have decisions go against them Everton bottling it like Villa smh hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm No other team in the Premier League gets given that penalty. £££ City Feel people here should read the handball rule. It is clearly a pen. Does not matter where the ball is going. Same with if players get taken out while the ball is going out, as Long as the ball is in play it is a pen. People Just hating since it is City. City are actually such a small club That was harsh [deleted] Fucking joke, only City would get those, maybe Newcastle too.  From an Arsenal fan, how can that be a penalty and Ødegaard playing Bowling in the Liverpool game not be.  Iz a disgrace. How is that not a natural position for the hand but odegaards  is a natural position? So this is given as a pen but the one for Liverpool against Arsenal last week is not? All we want is some f***ing consistency. Imo neither should be pens. The ball is kicked at him point blank range and his arm is up protecting his face. Not an unnatural position. Omfg start giving yellow cards for crowing the ref Surprised people here saying it's not a pen. Looks like it hit his hand first Well that's boring Hard to argue that wasn't an unnatural position and it was going to hit him in the face anyway. Penalties are a fundamentally flawed system example x86 Forgot having your arm above your head is a natural position Cringe watching city appeal, like babies I thought surrounding the ref was supposed to be punished nowadays, also if that isn't a natural arm position I don't know what is. It's so close, I don't know what he's supposed to do.... Not a pen, imo Typical city decision. The refs are the most influential people on the field, that means there is something wrong. Great call I swear City get all the 'technically accurate but practically not' decisions How is that Handball but Odegaard isn’t *laughs in Odegaard* Should've claimed he slipped. Propose new penalty rules:  - the player who is fouled to take the pen.  - penalty spot to be from the foul location  - no stuttering That ref is the grinch Pickford seems to be making a habit of punching/parrying into dangerous areas When the shot is inside the penalty area and a defender blocks it with their arm, the attacking team is going to get a penalty, especially when the arm is above head height. This is not a controversial decision at all. You can’t tell me there isn’t some sort of fixing going on between City and the PL/PGMOL.  City players constantly get away with otherwise infractions (dissent, crowding the ref, etc) and they get many favourable calls or ‘soft’ calls not awarded to other teams (particularly Liverpool and in more recent times Arsenal).  We also know that UK foreign ministry does not want the PL to come down hard on City’s 115 charges to not sever relations with Abu Dhabi.  What’s the point? How are spectators supposed to enjoy this sport when it is full of inequity? Hilarious that if we conceded a penalty like that everyone would say it’s a stonewall pen. The issue is that no one knows what is and isn’t a handball anymore. Not even the refs But odegaard can dribble the ball like a basketball away from attackers and it’s not a pen. So corrupt. Never a pen, what a load of shit. funny enough that city gets such a penalty while others don't :) Seems like we should have crowded the ref more for Odegaard’s handball, that being said our kits aren’t light blue so it may not work. Fuck the Prem, more scripted than WWE Every Man City thread is filled with the conspiracy clowns now  Wolves get fucked over multiple times as well, why doesn’t the conspiracy involve them and just Arsenal/Liverpool? “He slipped” - some arsenal fan somewhere So Odergaard isn't a pen but this one is? ...... City paying Coote a fair bit of money. Honestly a corrupt league, how many this season not given.  Ofc man city get given a handball without even a check. What a joke As usual How the fuck is that a pen? Ref remembered he’s gotta ref in the middle east next week. Soft fucking pen That is definitely not given without the shouting and screaming. Can’t blame them though, it works and they don’t get punished What an absolute joke. The city players basically brow beat the ref to give the pen there. Fuck that Assistant ref bullshit. Love this thread, puts a smile on my face Harsh pen but sometimes they’re given sometimes not. Looks like the linesman made the final call. Never a pen Another 100k as a fine and book every city player that crowded the ref Wait to see a team not get it given next week Complete joke.   That shot is going in the stands and it grazes the elbow at best City again, gets the call  Fucking ridiculous Never a pen, but when you have referees paid by the country which owns one of the clubs then you will get decisions like this. Only City get this penalty yep, on par with the pens that city get. File this with the hojlund one Soo tired of this league man, certain teams blatantly get officiated different than others. Just shoot at defenders arms and hope to get a pen at that point why do people even still watch this shit, referee variance just decides every game and nothing changes Every team crowds the ref but Pep's teams have always been experts at it PEN politics are in action again tomorrow the rules will be different again and the day after that they will change again would be boring otherwise right? Idc in spirit of the game that's not a handball Rodri literally controlled the ball with his arm at goodison 2 seasons ago. No penalty.  Block a shot from 1 yard away. Penalty Stonewall pen. Is the red spineless after being crowded? Yes  It it still a pen? Yes Pretty normal handball call of recent years, if the ref didn’t give it VAR would’ve. So there are 800 comments from arsenal and liverpool fans purely crying about crowding the ref. people crying as if the ref wasn't fucking city over this whole game lmao. nunes got rugby tackled and they didn't do shit what a pen lol Never a pen where’s his arm supposed to go. Got lucky he shanked the shot, but how on Earth can they excuse the fact that the ref has just clearly caved into the pressure from city players. He’s given a corner, the play has gone on for several seconds afterwards and neither him or the lineman thought it was a penalty. So why suddenly change? Absolutely absurd that the ref has genuinely caved in. Nice City are the only team to crowd the ref this season apparently Oh hey it’s time for the comments saying “clearly rigged for City” as if no other weird borderline handball has been given in the PL, lmao.   Like, this isn’t the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd handball given that was incredibly hard to prevent this season. But hey we can just keep saying rigged and ignore the actual problem of referees being incompetent.  Edit: Lol downvote me if you want, but the bias is so obvious. If Odegaard’s no-call handball happened for a City player, people would be saying it’s stonewall evidence the league is rigged. Keep distracting from the actual issues! Everton deserved a point. Sucks to see such a dodgy pen given in what’s been a good match. just protest until the refs whistles under all the pressure refball I’m tired Howard How can you argue that isn’t a natural position? Only team in the league that gets that as a penalty. Oh what a Coincidence Man City get another penalty and put them in a huge advantage after scoring in rapid fire mode at the start of 2nd half. Typical City. I want the Super League to avoid these awful refs. I don't even think it's a penalty but to be honest about 5 city players swarmed the referee and he changed the decision quite fast albeit through his assistant. It's shocking none of them got a yellow The city hate is real Refs making sure City win the league He was slipping which is no longer a pen as of last week. One rule for they and one rule for me   That should be about 10 yellow cards according to the rules Is he supposed to just let that ball hit him in the face. His arm is up yes but it is within his body and that ball smacks into his face if not his hand Thats such a harsh punishment for what was such a shite shot, but rules is rules. I’m a city fan and that was never a penalty. Literally what can you do when diving down?   Reminds me of the bayern v city game last season where both penalties were so stupid. We aren’t miles away from a flick up into the hand being a valid tactic. Incoming ppl saying it's corrupt when this is almost always given recently It hit his hand, therefore it's a penalty, it doesn't matter where it's going Absolute joke of a call Watching this decision and the penalty not given in our game yesterday, it's hard to argue that there isn't a bias here. I have 0 clue what is and isn't a handball anymore Only Dalot was booked during those City appeals Different rules for Man City, you know why City get a pen if it hits a dudes hand wild he's in a natural position. Liverpool don't get a pen when a dude is literally playing basket ball in the box. Classic perfectly fair and even interpretation of the rules....  This sports rules are so fucked haha Oml Pool fans and Gooners can't stfu with their whataboutism for two seconds Clear as daylight handball, penalty is almost always given, in any league for these. Not sure what some people saw to disagree with there.  Crowding the ref again? There should have been some sanctions here though. Never a pen and if it is, no one could tell u for sure. that's the city players charging the ref and ref shutting himself. Ødegaard was much worse and wasn’t given. I’ll take it tho Onana should have just said he slipped. “Entire Everton team need sucking off” - Wayne Rooney what’s natural position mean How many journalists got killed for that call?? The wrong Onana So if he doesn’t call it live, it likely isn’t given a pen due to distance right? yeah, it was too good to be true anyway.. I don’t understand the rules anymore That being a pen makes the Romero handball vs United even funnier.  Natural position, point blank range, not a pen then gets surrounded by half the city team shouting at him (none get carded). The inconsistency with the handball rule is so strange, this is a penalty but odegaards vs pool isn’t? I’m so bored of handball penalties Need to rinse my eyes after reading the comment here..lol The rules should be changed that if it's obviously not going on target or into the center to create a chance then it's not a penalty. Giving someone a goal for whiffing a shot into row ZZ and incidentally hitting an arm is weak as hell. Mirror: https://streamin.one/v/115c6318 true, was so pointless (not that it was intentional) Yeah this sort of confuses me, if he had not whiffed his shot and actually hit it on-target then it would never have hit Onana's hands/arms but only because he missed so badly did it hit Onana's hands. So he got rewarded for mis-hitting his shot, it just doesn't feel right.  Edit\* at the same time though it was a blatant handball so according to the rules seems like the right call, just weird how the rules work like that sometimes (i.e. rewarding someone for mishitting a ball) Yeah lucky in the spirit of the shot but it’s a clear handball Agreed. Almost impossible to come up with a standard that polices this out, but I always hate these kinds of calls where the shot was going no where close or the ball is bouncing away from goal. It’s a handball but doesn’t feel earned at all. > Prem this year   This would be PK even in previous years. The term usage in rules Interpretation is related to Making Frame of ones Body bigger (accidental or intentional doesn't matter). Unfortunate for defender sure but that has nothing to do with attacking team.   Many decisions for Penalties would be easier for fans to grasp if they too used this principle of Frame of the Body (this often means outstretched arms but that Frame model is better since it applies to more usecases and more fair). They have not been giving those for handballs? Now it suddenly is one. Makes no sense at all. That‘s more of a example of how terrible to entire penalty rule is. Almost like he wasn't aiming at the goal Don't know how clear and obvious the trajectory of that ball needs to be for VAR to understand that handling it was only consequential to the window it was about to break on the street over. Task failed successfully In fairness, I think he gave the penalty after looking to his assistant.   Pisses me off that the penalty is even given for that, but it’s more likely for two referees to be wrong than one referee changing his mind because some players crowding. Put it on the tab they do it because they can and it works. the ref didn‘t seem to want to give the penalty until he was crowded by all the city players… They'll add it to the other 115 charges then do nothing about it. Sadly we all know the answer to that question Possibly? Goalkeeper shenanigans are booked consistently though. is it surprising after after we know the [uae is in direct talks with the uk government for the breaches](https://theathletic.com/4889001/2023/09/22/man-city-charges-premier-league-abu-dhabi/) ? He booked Grealish for getting fouled and then winning the ball. I’d imagine the club will get a fine for it, pretty sure they’ve already been fined for crowding already this season. i still don’t get how haaland didn’t get a ban when van dijk did. both did the exact same thing The brown envelope was too thick for that The only player to come out with a yellow card was an Everton one lol Nah they're going to get fined despite the referee not even bothering to put it in their report like we got in the FA Cup game Booked so bad the ref awarded the penalty Course not, they’re the leagues favorite little children. Should just book em all That's not how it works. That's why they are intelligent and crowd with every player at once. Just like when there is a rout, only 1 per team usually gets booked. Guardiola team special. They looked like prime Barca charging down that ref. The fine is going to be CRAZY considering it was like 150k last time. They need to cut it out. Another 120k, so dumb. At least it goes to grassroots football [deleted] And the Everton ones? We can't hurt our precious underdog Pep, the whole country is rooting for them to win the league fair and square. How many arsenal players got booked for surrounding the ref during the Newcastle game again? Corrupt league. Refs get paid by City’s owner. It’s truly a joke That was unbelievable, talk about ""rules for thee but not for me"". The ref should have booked at least 3 or 4 of them, just embarrassing for the ref to not book any of the Man City children. Different interpretation by different refs I have no clue what the rules are now..  Is it if it hits the hand at all when it’s a shot?  Are they saying it was an unnatural position?  God knows but it feels wrong that that should be a pen It’s fairly consistently applied for certain clubs Whatever it takes for city to regain 1st place. VAR checking club badge is what decides which rule set to use. Depends what club it’s against Basically if it's Liverpool it's not handball but if its City it's handball. The benchmark is actually very consistent, ""does this decision benefit Man City?"" The benchmark is if it favours City or not We gotta help the underdog that is Man City to have a chance at the title this year. I just recognize that I 100% don’t understand the hand ball rule. I’m not sure if that’s because I’m an idiot (I am) or if it’s because the refs have no fucking clue either. It doesn't, given on the field for one and then the arm is up at high that's a factor.  I think it's on the soft side but it's hardly some crazy call. I think that is a handball by the rules, I just don't agree with the rules. Pretty sure the assistant told the ref in his ear that it was a handball I mean you can't blame them for doing it, it *clearly* works Never seem to get penalised for getting in the refs face do they To be fair it's a stonewall pen yeh never seen something like that in a long time, looking to the assistant my ass lmfao Ref was looking at the assistant. Waited for confirmation from him Or there's this fella called a linesman and he told the ref about it. And it just happens to be City when this happens. What a coincidence. It was blatant mate. Yeah that was going right into his face anyway. Not sure how var doesn't overturn this one It’s Chelsea mid-noughties levels of cryarsing from these cunts every game now. Drogba, Terry and Cashley used to be the ringleaders for those pricks. Also helps that it's a handball. As soft as it is, the decision is correct. Let's put the tinfoil hats away. Dalot got two yellows for a milder reaction. Reklamierarm as we like to say in German 90% might be on the low end. Honestly true for any big sports subreddit. Liverpool and Arsenal fans are the majority of this subreddit so their imagined conspiracy theory dominates the conversation. For real This is a textbook handball and penalty I mean every pundit I’ve heard considered an ”expert” thinks it’s not a penalty so idk if you can say it’s just a Reddit thing I would agree if this decision was made by some other ref. But the same ref a week ago called the Odegaard incident as no penalty and suggested that his hand movements were natural. Onana's hand movements were more natural than Odegaard's . No one is talking about conspiracy shit but why the ref isn't consistent about his decision? And the rest didn’t kicked the ball in their entire lifetime exactly, it’s a clear pen Blind hate can do a number on folks Welcome to this sub. It’s full of 10 year olds that don’t know anything about football 😂 Do you watch the prem every week? You get this call not called in 7/10 games in the prem it ball to the hand.. not hand to the ball.. lol It's an obvious penalty. The discourse should more so be around how unfortunate this scenario is, whether or not the language around what is and is not supposed to be interpreted as a handball should change, and whether City's players crowding the ref should be subject to further discipline or not. city literally got a fine for doing it last time. other teams do the same shit. grow up Yeah WTF my thoughts exactly gives this pen It's getting harder to enjoy this season. At least he has made some progress in that regard! Cant be mad about that! Nah - it was closer to hitting the ISS than the back of the net, but it was missing his head. For me I just want to know what the rules are and ask that we Stick to them. If it's a pen, fine. But it better still be a pen next week Protecting his face clearly It amazes me every time this comes up that people believe this matters. “Face protection” is school football rules, it’s not actually a thing. It’s still handball. And if my aunt had wheels she’d be a bicycle Hard to say. If it was slightly lower I'd have no hesitation but it possibly would have gone over his head. Him raising his arm doesn't help either. The one against us should have been a pen realistically They're not even close to the same situation. Odegaard slipped and used his arm for balance. It'd be harder to find a handball that was given for the same offense Both are pen. Odegaard decision has nothing to do with this lmao Odegaard was slipping to the ground when the ball hit his hand, here the defender is deliberately sliding to defend against the attack And that's pl refs for you And then lose his head of course Protecting the nuts or hands behind one’s back is the safest strategy Well if he cant dive in without using his arms to make himself bigger and then block the shot with them, he shouldn’t be diving in. He is not entitled to go for a block any way he feels like Not block the ball with his hand. You guys are really reaching here. I think if it's going into the goal then they should get a penalty. Because regardless of natural position or not it stopped a goal .  But they have var here . That being skyed into the stand . Defender does nothing wrong . Just play on Just not over his head would be fine. Premier League has taken the stance that diving in like this with arms spread is the risk a defender takes when he decides to dive in (as well as the reward a team gets for getting the ball into the box). It’s a silly way to decide a game, but it’s probably a pen by the rule books and the Prem’s interpretation (consistency notwithstanding, see Odegaard Saturday). >  Dive in with his arms by his sides?  That is one approach  As long as you keep your arms low and tucked into your body, you should be fine TBH   In this case, the arm is raised—that usually gets called as ""not a natural position"" There aren't any rules just the subjective interpretation of the the group of ref assistant and VAR every game Neither do the refs. Mate we see these given a lot? Yeah to me it looks like his arm is in line with his body in relation to the path of the ball. Like if the ball continued in a straight line it would hit his chest or head.  I also don’t know if proximity matters anymore but that was awfully close The rules really depend on whether they favor city or not If it favours Man City it's a pen. Any other team and it's not a pen. Easy rules. The rules are whatever benefit Man City is the correct call, they’re the ones paying off the refs. It’s been this way for years. Rules are fucked   How can you dive to block a shot Joining?  Coote lives in the chat at all times The loop hole is to dribble it like a basketball. Then you're safe. It really depends on what team is playing. Trying to protect his face from getting absolutely clobbered. I guess our games against Tottenham and wolves never happened So we are just ignoring these last games where City have been shafted by the refs? Lol ?? He's raising his arm The only thing that is consistent with these prem refs... 😂😂 spot on, Very sus when the ref is getting funding from the country which owns CFG. Typical whiny arsenal fan But it was a pen Did you think odegaard dribbling the ball should’ve been a pk? Shot the ball 15 yards above the bar and get a free goal for it The city hate in this thread is hilarious It was a very clear pen? Typical Arsenal supporter Classic Arsenal supporter. Rent free The United one too with Luke Shaw, more similar to this. I guess it’s only for arm bracing the fall not the one protecting your face though 😂 That's only if the ball hits the arm that's supporting your fall He’s not falling down he’s purposefully sliding to block the shot Ah that's where you're wrong, most likely they weren't playing City. Did it hit the arm he's using to break his fall? The defender here isn't even falling. He's jumping/sliding/tackling to block the shot. There's something seriously wrong with this sub Bring back indirect free kicks - accidental handballs that aren't blocking a goal should be indirect free kicks instead. Pens are too harsh a punishment and indirect FKs are hilarious Nah see when it’s city, if it’s dodgy, it’s a green light. If it’s Everton it’s a 10 point deduction. It’s not even protecting your face, it’s literally impossible to run and slide with your arms by your sides. City have so many things going against them, approximately 115, gotta give them a break. Or 15. 😂😂😂 Yes, that's exactly it.  It couldn't be that the ref actually waited for his linesman to confirm.  No, no. We will go with the nonsense conspiracy instead. you forgot  >Assistant gets the right call and tells the ref > doesn't know if pen  >checks with assistant and var  >gives pen definitely the assistants call then, ref wouldn't have been able see so signalled for corner but looked at the assistant before changing it to a pen The ref didn't have a good view and he checked with his assistant Harder for VAR to overrule the decision too. I'm not saying there's a conspiracy but surely if the ref thinks it's a corner he let's VAR take the wheel on that one rather than changing his mind on pitch Corruption now means ‘a decision that goes against my team’ i know it doesn't matter in context, but that shot going 20 meters high but still getting awarded a pen feels so dirty It was a penalty though With rules being how they are this is a pen BUT it really shouldn’t have been. Was a blatant handball I hate the handball laws in this league, they're a joke. clear pen though? The fact that this comment is upvoted is a complete embrrassment You'll score another I bet Arm in a natural position and right in front of his face, and the ball is kicked from mere feet away, AND it's going almost straight up into row Z. I think you should have definitely got a penalty last week as well [deleted] It's literally in the rulebook.  Added: [https://www.footballrules.com/offences-sanctions/handball/](https://www.footballrules.com/offences-sanctions/handball/)  >WHAT HAPPENS IF…   >   >a player is falling and the ball hits their supporting arm, which is between their body and the ground?   >   >**This is not handball** (unless the ball goes directly into the opponents’ goal or the player scores immediately afterwards, in which case a direct free kick is awarded to the other team). It wasn't because of City players surrounding him but he was actually being told by the linesman He literally got the call from the assistant, jfc I don't think you guys actually watch the games Actually Luton got this call against us. It's nowhere near as corrupt as you hope it is, it's just a shit rule Odegaard dribbled the ball with his hand and we got fuck all only last week. Short memory ? VAR still looks at it regardless. He is just calling it as he, or his assistant, sees it They “checked” for about 6 seconds lol VAR does take a look before giving jt lol I swear these comments are something else here It's a stonewall pen, these have been called all season under the current rules That's not what happened at all Lol No common sense ever prevails It was quite clearly a pen The Prem is an absolute joke. Fuck this league Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City, Man U, Chelsea sponsorships ~ 50 million per season  Spurs ~ 40 million per season  Everyone else sponsorships ~ Less than 10 million save for West Ham and Aston Villa  FFP already is a system that despite its many benefits is designed to keep the richest clubs top and does not take sponsorships into account, a system held up by teams like Liverpool and a system that ensured the only way smaller teams like City at the time could catch up was foreign investment through ownership (we will see if it is cheating once it has gone through court, I suspect it likely is)  And you're crying corruption? It's been corrupt for longer than City sunshine. You cry wolf now because you stopped benefitting from it, plain and simple. City will face justice when their actions come back to them, but none of you lot ever will. You want a fair playing field? It's not possible anymore without stripping the whole business aspect of football, which won't happen. How? His arm was up its a pen If this happened to you and wasn’t given we wouldn’t hear the end of it Looked to me the linesman made the final call Or the assistant told him They should get a nice fine for their troubles again, how will they pay it I think he changed his mind because of his assistant They were kindly reminding him who pay his wages when he goes to ref in the middle East next week. We literally got a goal against you disallowed for a foul that was very soft. Get all the 50/50 calls my ass Ironic isn’t it? I need help, whats rigged? Because the odegaard one absolutely was more of a penalty than this one, but I don't get how a wrong call like 30mins into a big game makes the whole sport rigged? If the ‘shit is rigged’ so ‘obviously’, explain to me why Man City would get a 95th minute penalty given against them at home, even if it was obviously the right decision to give it?   Like genuinely explain to me why a referee wouldn’t wave that away if they were being paid to help City out. Why was the Romero handball against United not given? It was even more of a clear handball and even the shot was on target?. See hands over head handballs not given all the time Not getting obvious penalties called against them. He’s supposed to try and block the ball legally.  Why are there people in the sub saying ‘He’s protecting his face’ like it means anything? Why would that mean it shouldn’t be a foul? If he caught the ball and threw it away to ‘protect his face’, would that not be a penalty? There’s nothing in the laws of the game that says ‘a player may handle the ball to prevent themselves from getting a sore face’. [deleted] Certainly isn’t blatant lol. The whole natural body position thing is in question as what exactly are you to do with your arms sliding to the ground for a block? Here in lies the problem. Similar incidents occur in other matches and are not given. Refs show no consistency, even with the use of VAR an it frustrates fans even further. Do you watch a lot of prem? Because idk how  the word consistent and handball go in the same sentence Liverpool fans don’t. You would watching Newcastle games lol Why do they always make the right calls in favor of City but wrong calls from everyone else? Bottling it? It's not exactly even opposition is it? Tbf I think people are fed up with the inconsistency: city always get this call, and rightly so, but then a few days earlier odegaard isn’t penalized. looks like he was waiting for confirmation from the linesman Cash offer came in late Well yeah it obviously hits his hand. The reason people don’t think it’s a pen is because they realise that it’s impossible to run and slide whilst keeping your hands by your sides.    So it feels really harsh when the player is just doing a natural movement, is a yard away from the city player and is just unlucky that the ball has been blasted at his arm.  You see great last ditch tackles all the time, I don’t think we need to start discouraging defenders from sliding in because a ball hits their arm from a yard away with no time to react. 😭😭 It was funny at first but it's getting boring now. Can't have a reasonable discussion with anyone on here. Especially as a City fan.  It's an absolute clownshow like you say. They're like fucking Qanon or something, completely lost the plot. I used to just blame the yanks for that kind of behaviour on this sub but I've found many other English people spouting some utter tripe on here about us. Are you seriously saying Odegaard *didn't* slip? Based on our league position we're doing a shite job of paying the refs, unless we're paying them specifically to fuck Liverpool? The assistant gave it. Had nothing to do with the City players. And instead of rebutting the ""800 comments from arsenal and liverpool fans crying about crowding the ref"" you just say that it's a pen? But that's not what people are crying about according to you.. Rodri could nuke the city of Liverpool and not get carded If you think city has been fucked over this whole game you need to wash your oil and blood soaked glasses. lol literally last week Odegaard was playing basketball in his own box and a pen wasn’t given. You can definitely make the argument that Onana’s hand was in a natural position. While I agree that the trajectory is not a factor, it's not enough for the ball to hit his hand.  Hand has to be moving or in an unnatural position.  The ""unnatural position"" is the debate here. Yeah it's crazy that people would compare and contrast similar calls in games in the same week. I mean that's totally obsurd!  We should just let spurs and city get special treatment week in, week out, and never mention it at all. That's the only healthy way we can get past this corrupt VAR era ruining the gane we all love [deleted] [deleted] He looked like he was making a sliding tackle, you need to use your arms for balance to make this tackle. How could he have avoided the ball from that distance? But those are not always given in the EPL. Especially not from that short a distance. A bit like penalties when theres no chance of a goal scoring opportunity coming, players running from the wing to the middle.of the pitch and crosses into the corner of the area and gets brought down. It's a penalty but really isn't in the spirit of the rule The shoulder distinction is relatively new which is why I mentioned it. I believe it’s a pen but the problem I have with it is if the ref didn’t give it originally there’s no chance VAR overturns it I could very well be wrong since I have the game on a second monitor & only paying mild attention to the match. From the look I took of the replay, looked like the arm was up & in front of the players face, largely within the silhouette of the player, but since it was up, away from the body & horizontal, it was sticking out of the players frame too.  If it didnt strike the arm, looked like it would have hit the guy square in the face. Id for sure reflexively stick my arm out like that too in fear of loosing a tooth or 2.  Think its given as a pen though for the criteria i described. The arm is raised & infront of the player. If it wasnt outstreched, I think it wouldnt have been a pen.  Obligatory VARchester City (this bits a joke). VAR can't rule on a handball based on trajectory, other than for deciding red cards. So handball should only be punished it it's a shot on goal? Not the point though is it  How many of them run straight to the referee crying for a penalty instead of playing?  I don't care if they were right in their complaints or not, every one of them that ran over to the referee should have immediately been booked  It's fucking pathetic especially when Pickford gets booked for walking to the edge of his 6 yard box before the penalty, something he does with EVERY FUCKING PENALTY AS PREPARATION He was actually pointing to a corner before checking w his assistant who gave the pen. He was looking at the linesman >they do it because they can  They literally can't, it's why they got fined the last time He was discussing with his linesman Literally all teams do this. Grow up Why do players have to crowd the ref to get the rules enforced? How did 10 City players see it, his linesmen see it, but he saw a corner? Literally all teams do this, including Liverpool. Grow up I don't think his booking is unfair, it's just funny that it's right after City players were screaming in the ref's face I can see it now delegates from UAE sitting around a table with rishi sitting there promising to put pressure on refs to make sure city don't get booked when crowding players. That’s a reach we need to pay them more cus they were rawdogging us all game 😭 [deleted] Not to mention halaand tweeted about it after the game No they didn’t and it’s daft reddit keeps claiming they did. Refusing to leave the pitch after a red and shouting at the ref after he didn’t play advantage are astronomically different. I get people hate city but just whine about the money and stop making shit up Cos they were pretty different, VVD also failed to leave the field and then got the 4th official on the way off. Easy...one plays for liverpool, the other plays for an oil state owned club Yes this is all corruption and totally doesn't happen to every team when they crowd the ref, they all get booked Mikel Arteta probably got booked somehow And how many booking did you get for all the moaning you guys do?  Like during the Newcastle game, a game where they got 3 over one incident. You act like every team doesn’t crowd the ref when they want a call to go their way lol meanwhile liverpool players and other teams players do the same shit and they also don't get booked we literally got fined the other week for it [deleted] Ah yes, forgot how VVD gets booked every time he yells at the referee. Yout team is up there with City with crowding the ref my man.   edit: struck some nerve huh? as if that does matter to city 150 k, oh no! Pep probably loves it when they do that. Pep DNA. We should all just accept that they have a divine right to win. And yet still no bookings lol Read his comment again? It’s the same VAR official as the Liverpool Arsenal game where they decided that odegaard handball was not a penalty. I might be having a massive brain malfunction but I SWEAR we've had a lot of questionable handballs waved away this season because they were hit from a yard away...exactly like this one. They’re saying it’s unnatural as they have multiple times for multiple different teams It's the height of the hand and it was given on the field. The rule is simple. It has to be deliberate contact with the ball to be a foul. That includes making yourself unnaturally bigger in order to block a cross or shot.  I agree with you, I think this interpretation has to be revised because this is a fairly natural position of the arm when you slide in.   However, per the rule and guidelines it's the correct decision. These are usually called now. See also Romero vs Arsenal earlier this season. It’s consistently applied all the time.  I know people don’t like City in here but Onana made himself bigger there and it clearly hit his arm so that’s an easy handball call Refs need to step it up a bit for us to win at this rate It’s because the law is written so poorly that you could just about justify any contact with the arm or hand as a hand ball offence. The ref had 3 players in front of him and the linesman had a good view. It 100% was the linesman's call. He did and VAR checked it You can blame them when every other te gets Penalised for for doing the same. Doesn’t work for others, dissent apparently warrants red cards Only for them lol First game of the season they did, then refs stopped carding people for it, no consistency Got fined a few weeks ago You must have missed the fine they got recently then. Selective bias on display here. We literally got the biggest fine for this yet after the Tottenham game Why do you choose to believe the conspiracy theory explanation instead of the reasonable one? They have earpieces >yeh never seen something like that in a long time  Do you not watch football? A shot on goal inside the box hit his extended arm above his head.  lmao, not sure how you’ve managed to work yourself into a victimization frenzy about this It's handball, it's not controversial. Unlucky VAR might not call it if the ref didn't, but since the ref didn't like getting yelled at by the city players, he gave it on the pitch. At that point the ball did hit his arm, so there's not enough ""clear and obvious error"" to overturn And literally everyone here and on TV said it was a bullshit call. Good thing they’ve never officiated a game then. Being an expert at playing the game doesn’t make you an expert on the rules of the game or how to enforce them. didnt this just happened to Luton last match? The punishment clearly didn't work then, it's not stopped. But unnaturally bigger is, and if the ball would have otherwise hit the face, clearly the arm hasn’t made their profile bigger People will downvote this when it’s literally in the rules, if the ball hits the supporting arm of a player that’s slipping/falling to the ground it’s not a handball. The VAR officials consider the height of your hands and why they’re in that position. He was slipping, just like Saka slipping into Gravenberch(?) wasn’t given. The pitch was horrid If you've played even 5 minutes of sport, ever, you'd understand that it's impossible to move and be dynamic, agile, and explosive without using your arms to balance that movement.  He's not deliberately trying to make himself bigger, its part of maintaining balance while make a dynamic movement. Just like players stick their arm out to counter balance their legs momentum when shooting,  or if he was running upright and his arm was pumping infront of his body.  Expecting defenders to defend in a way that's only possible with their arms behind their back is crazy. If the shot was on target it wouldn’t have hit his arm What did he block? A goal kick? Everyone taking crazy pills on this post Liverpool didn’t get that the other day vs arsenal No, they've had a lot of handballs waved off this year for being too close to the guy kicking the ball. Liverpool didn't get similar handballs against Arsenal or United, just recently. There's probably dozens of similar ones around the league that aren't given. They’re supposed to consider proximity, and also whether the position of arm/hand can be justified by the movement of their body. He’s moving towards the ground going for a tackle, he’s not going to naturally have his arms pinned to his sides. He’s also not made his body that much bigger, there’s loads of comments on here saying his arms are above his head when they’re not.   I don’t understand how you give a penalty based on that criteria, Odegaard being off balance and having a wobble is apparently enough to get away, but going in for a tackle from close range is not. this type of handball has been given to other teams too lmao what are you on Yeah, not like Arsenal got away with the most blatant handball this season against Liverpool. Why should a defender be allowed to block a shot with their arms? New PL meta: don’t score goals, just aim at hands. One goal vs 20 hands yknow. It’s funny to me they want to protect from more head injuries now but then players get penalized for controlling their challenge and protecting their face from a smashed ball. How are the players even supposed to know what to do anymore with the zero consistency? Still, everybody laughed when this happened to Pogba. Still think that one time some player could have got a second yellow counts as being shafted? Ok I can think of one single occasion where a ref blew his whistle early, not like you’d even scored a goal but the way you go on about it he chalked it off after you’d scored it He's bringing it closer to his body to shield his face. You ever played football? directly in front of his face Film yourself attempting this block 10 times, and see where your right arm ends up every time. Guarantee (IFF you've played the game) that your right arm comes up and across your body, and your left arm goes back and out.  Because your left shoulder needs to go downward to protect your fall, your right shoulder (and therefore arm) has to go upwards. Everything is a pen for an Argentinian That's not how the rule works if it's on target or not has no effect on the handball rule Not how the rule works mate It’s a weird call but it is a penalty, any other team and not one person would care It's a coping mechanism. When they lose titles to City, they can blame the refs and cry conspiracy. Everyone here is blinded by their hatred, like this is as clear as day shhh everyone reasonable enough knows this is a clear pen, did you notice that only City's rivals flairs are complaining ? If the same pen wasn't rewarded to Arsenal they would be crying for a year at least Everything is a penalty in Argentine eyes completely natural position to throw into a shot like this + short distance.  wouldnt have been overturned if he stayed on his first decision So clear that they are routinely not given/overturned for being too close and in a natural position. I'm happy with every one of those being given but there is just no consistency. And I'm the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Yeah and we've seen at times they don't get given, that rarely occurs when City are playing though. Wrong Luke Shaws hands were next to his sides in a purely natural position. What are you on about? Good one dude, there totally haven’t been weird handball calls or handball no-calls in the PL at all. It’s definitely rigged by City and not weird handball rules with inconsistent refereeing. well he didn’t wait he motion towards a corner. then they started yelling and he switched the call. Doesn't fit the narrative tho Fuck me, the imagination on you lad. ""games gone"" means VAR gives a decision against my team Always has been with any fan of a big club. We've seen penalties given for balls getting knocked out towards the corner flags tbh. Won't change until the handball rule evolves to take into account shots on target or key passes leading to goalscoring opportunity, which honestly sounds like very muddy water. Just aim at peoples arms in the box at this rate That was my thoughts too.  It *doesn't* make a difference, but really feel like it should. the only reason it was even a debatable handball is bc it was soo off target.. it should be like in the nfl when they don’t call a pi bc it’s uncatchable. It was a natural position and he is also very close to the guy who is taking the shot. It's not a 'clear' penalty No handball penalties are on purpose. They are basically all flukes.  This one is one they'll give fairly consistently. Wasn't a pen when Romero did worse against us. Where were you when the Romero pen wasn't given against United. Pens cannot be subjective Why shouldn't it? That's not a natural arm movement at all Based on all the non-handballs this season I don’t see how this can be in the rules. Because unnatural position? What rules? The rules are changed weekly. How is this worse than the Odegaard handball? Yep. People are outraged now because it's been awarded to City but we've had similar decisions ruled against us and I'm sure other clubs have as well that won't garner anywhere near this kind of attention. Wrong Wolves weren't given a pen against Chelsea on Sunday for essentially the same thing. Wolves shot likely woulda been a goal too By the laws sure. But 5 years ago and every year before that would never be a handball. The guys tackling with the aim of blocking, the shot is going over the bar, and the distance between foot and hand is less than 1m. that’s the least consequential handball i’ve ever seen. the law is awful  city always has their way eventually. You all remember the rodri handball that they didn’t call so city could win the league? Really? I don't think it's that clear. No other team in the league gets it. Odegaard started playing basketball against us and we didn’t get a penalty. Really?   If I speak 🤔🤔🤔 Harsh to punish Salah for sending odegaard the wrong way Shhh that doesn’t fit his agenda They don't Still think it’s a dodgy call, but that was my interpretation too. However city should have been given a yellow for the surrounding of the ref. It always city getting preferential treatment and it’s annoying. tbf he didn't say that the city players caused the ref to change his call, just that he didn't make his call until he was surrounded by city players. Agreed with this.  City probably do get a few more, but also probably have more chances and shots in and around the box. No other team in the league gets this apart from City and whoever is playing wolves Didn't that pen get called by a ball that bounced off the body and shouldnt have been a pen? Odegaard plays basketball, all fine. Everton player gets blasted from a foot away with his hand in front of his face stopping a shot that’s going out the stadium, penalty. I don’t understand the rules. Odegaard was drowning at the time due to us flooding Anfield at the time tbf to him, at least that's what Arsenal fans are telling me. I get the frustration, really. But the rules on this are very fucking clear. A player slipping or losing balance and extending their arm to support themselves is NOT a handball. Like it or not, it’s very clearly defined in the rules.   Directly from IFAB: If a player touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger. A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised  https://www.theifab.com/news/annual-general-meeting-2021/  If you don’t think Ode had his hand in a natural position, I’d challenge you to tie your hands behind your back and go run around on some ice and see what your natural instinct is. Nah he just only watches clips that make the r/soccer front page. But var can't really change it either way the on field ref gives it. Neither call was clearly and obviously wrong. Why didn’t he look at the monitor? No Lol no. Romero against United? It was not given. You watching the same game? It is It was quite clearly a natural position How is the arm not in a natural position? That’s just what your arm would do when moving like that. Because apparently VAR official David Coote found out what a handball is in the last week after not penalizing Odegaard playing basketball against Liverpool. Both stonewall penalties, yet only one was awarded His arm was in front of his face Wrong He’s falling down. His arm is in a natural position and it’s hit at him from 2 meters away. Take it you've never played football before, that's a perfectly normal position for your arm to be when you're making a sliding challenge. It was clearly unintentional and it stopped a shot from being blazed 20 meters over the bar. Fuck off. How is that any difference from Odegaard missed pen from last week? It's a natural position. For absolutely every other team, the ref doesn’t give it, it goes to VAR, not a clear and obvious error. The issue people have with City is that there seems to be absolutely no such thing as a 50/50. If there’s any doubt, it’s given. Chelsea v Liverpool. Close range, hand was outside the body, up and ball was actually heading towards the net. Nothing given.   This is close range, hand up shielding face, ball heading to the roof and it’s a penalty. Someone please explain it?!? But every players arms go up like this when making a block or a tackle - when you’re a yard away and somebody kicks it at you it’s pretty unfair I think.  In the space of a week odegaard seeing the ball from 20 yards away and swooping down like he’s preventing a free throw has been deemed a natural movement while the ball being blasted at you from a yard away isn’t. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. Lol. As if we’d get a penalty for that. And they didn't even bother going to the monitor why? Fucking terrible bullshit from top to bottom this fucking league No other team in the league currently get away with crowding the ref like city do It’s a natural human reaction FFS. He’s supposed to just fall like a salmon and get concussed? They’re humans, not FIFA robots. Because he made a logical bet? Lmao people here can be so stupid. Not hold it above your head? And use it to block a shot? This situation has been called a handball regularly in the last season or two. So you only want there to be inconsistency when it would screw City. Got it This. Same ref on var too so it’s sus Odegaards isn't a pen according to the current rules though. You can dislike the rule of course, but he was very obviously slipping and his arm movement was a direct consequence of that Always? City got fucked against both Tottenham and Wolves. Also had other games with stupid calls against them. U had Chelsea were the ref somehow avoid giving Calagher(or how the fuck u spell his name) red and not Even yellow, think it was Sterling having a red card tackle not getting red. And Cucurela diving with a yellow card and not getting a second while Doku got one earlier in the match. Of course i know the ref also had a few bad calls the other way too. It is that when calls go City way, Even if they are correct people Just get mad since people want City to lose. If this was any other team people would not really care.   The refs are Just shit, that how it is. This calls are always going to happen to any team until the leauge deside to do something, but the will not fo that with the People who are sitting there now becuase they are the stupid fucks who let them do this shit calls. And sadly it is like this in most leauge since there are people at the top who knows it does not matter to get good refs/learn the refs what the rules are since they earn more money and views from people talking about the shit calls. Hopefully there comes along someone who desides to actually change that, but I don't think it will ever happen.   I got a bit to much sidetracked. Got a bit too much into it. I would love to be a ref myself to try and fix it. I know most the rules and would learn the stuff i don't know But it is hard when u are to sick and have injured urself. He didn’t. He got torched by Salah and swiped at the ball. His hand didn’t even touch the ground after swiping it Sometimes you gotta pay ref's AND not play like shit, can't just be one or the other That doesn’t fit my narrative of City corruption so unfortunately you’re wrong everton players could kill someone on the pitch and nothing would happen you haven't been watching the game then. all decisions went towards everton. akanji's whole bottom half was about to be exposed from an everton player pulling his pants down. That's the point. Decisions have been inconsistent everywhere. We've seen clearer handballs not given and less clear handbills given. It ain't corruption, its shite refereeing and VAR He has his arm raise, it's a penalty, if it was for you, you would've been screaming your head off I genuinely don't know what is and what isn't a handball penalty anymore.  Feels like all they do is flip a coin now. I saw a rumour that Odegarrd is signing with the Harlem Globetrotters at the end of the season…. Got a clip? That’s because It is subjective. Every single foul is slightly different, every ref will see a situation slightly different, every grounds fan noise can add pressure.   We would wish that it was objective but it’s not really. Our club bias also makes us see every foul differently, so us as fans are probably the worst judges. what are you chatting about ...They're kinda en route to that mate  They're 1st.. I'm not disappointed about the league title, as we aren't really good enough to win it this year.   You're still a grade A weirdo though considering you've made this same comment about 10 times over the past few weeks. A bit obsessive lad. They’re top.. alright mate rent free How come you don't talk about Chelsea anymore?  Are you going to delete this comment too? Is your brain deep fried? … I’m not a Liverpool fan. This comment is extremely stupid. We’d be miles clear if we hadn’t been repeatedly screwed by the referees this year. Would probably have two more recent titles if it wasn’t for refs as well…. So yes we’re disappointed and yes we actually have a shot at winning the title I think even accidental handballs are still handballs according to the rules, handballs that are on purpose usually result in a yellow or red card but handball by accident is just a foul. What's strange is that the ball had no chance of going in and so the player did not really gain an advantage by it hitting their hand in this scenario. Usually that’s for like a cross but for a shot with an arm raised that is given Because it’s a subjective call whether the referee thinks the arm is in a natural position or not. VAR would only intervene if the referee didn’t see the contact with the arm at all. Yeah the rules about a lot of things are shit, won't stop me from complaining about them. Just like VAR not being able to review a second yellow.  Not like they've readdressed handball situations countless times in the past 5 seasons I'd try to not create such binary qualifiers and just apply common sense. We should adopt a similar system to how Rugby does it, only captain gets to speak to the ref, book anyone else although they'd probs fuck up that and make it so only players with even numbers can approach the ref or some bollocks. No ref is gonna book every player who runs over to them, they've barely got the bollocks to reverse decisions.  Pickford getting a booking was stupid though, think the ref lost control of the game and was just chucking out yellows to look like he's doing something. Like Walker delayed the game afterwardsa and no yellow lol... Great reffing really. In a perfect spot to see it, 5 yards away, don't think it's a penalty but then change your mind cos your mate half a mile away thinks it was whilst squinting.   He's given a corner, he's in an ideal position to see it. Why does he change his mind because a less senior referee in a worse position thinks it's a penalty? Ah and what do we call fines for people who can afford it?  Price of doing business. They do get away with it, all of them make more than 120k a week individually. The club has infinite money so it doesn’t matter for it aswell. Guys! Come look, we found one of the three man city fans! Two completely unrelated situations though. If Ederson would not have been booked for the same thing, I'd understand. Laugh now, I wont be surprised if it comes out the UAE has actually paid PGMOL in any way   They’ve already done proven shady stuff with Mancini and under the table payments, they have a track record of pushing every limit there is and fighting it with an army of lawyers, don’t know how you can give them the benefit of the doubt to the team that has had a chairman come out and said that he’d “rather spend 30M on the best lawyers in the world to sue [UEFA] for the next 10 years” ( talking about the CL investigations ) Football is nothing compared to geopolitics. Having favourable decisions in the prem means nothing to the UK if it gains favour with the UAE. Besides, the only competitor to city now is Liverpool who are owned by a sports group which hardly matters compared to an important nation state or even an investment firm like clearlake, were Chelsea are ever to get close to a title race again The team with 115 open charges for cheating couldn’t possibly be cheating must be a manchester thing to be able to get away with that considering uniteds captain is allowed to hit linesmen Haaland literally punched the ref and got no punishment. They pay the refs. No other teams can get away with it like they can. Oil money. Saudi. Games gone Not getting a ban for touching a ref is so cowardly from the governing bodies the statement about van dijks extended ban was specifically for language used to the referee and mentions nothing about refusing to leave the pitch Sure but when you compare what Haaland did to what Dalot did there's only one of those that seems worthy of a double yellow. Haaland's tantrum went on for more than 5 times as long and he actually got in the ref's face whereas Dalot hardly got within 10 yards of him Most teams don't crowd the ref. Except man city for example, as we have literally just witnessed? I don't understand people who defend City who aren't City fans lol You can’t be serious thinking every team does this to the same extent? It’s not even close. Have you seriously not seen the levels of petulant and entitled Pep’s team has become over the years? They make a very strong habit to get as many players to surround the ref whenever a “close” decision doesn’t go their way. And banned for three games if your van dijk. If there's one thing we know about city, it's that fines *definitely* hurt them more more than anything Yeah and you just got a penalty out of it today How did you afford to pay that? Hope you’re ok. Don't care about the fine, give them all yellows, City have infinite money so giving them a fine is pointless. [deleted] The refs certainly does. Considering what the apparent precedent for handballs at Goodison Park are in this fixture... PGMOL do. What the PL think is irrelevant between kick off and full time. >VVD gets booked every time he yells at the referee.  He literally is the only player to receive extra ban for this. I’d look a little more closer to home buddy. Your captain literally put hands on a linesman and avoided any consequences. bro was even asking for a yellow but nope Well he doesn’t, think that’s happened maybe twice? But nice try mate. It’s also the same VAR that judged [this as not handball](https://twitter.com/0neastonvilla/status/1738483500834078941?s=46&t=e0tjKaN0KmklbDmWtjRq7A)  Playing fucking volleyball out there ffs Well you see the difference is he‘s employed by City‘s owners, not by Liverpool‘s owners. So it‘s not really the same situation. You can’t make this shit up. VAR is different though because VAR protocol states it has to be a ""clear and obvious error"" to overturn the onfield decision. I think, and I might be wrong here, that the difference is that they're ruling that he is deliberately making his frame bigger by leaving his arm in an unnatural position.  I don't really think he was, but that's what the interpretation from the refs is. I'll be honest it didn't seem particularly unnatural to me but alright  the other thing I question is that I have definitely seen handballs not called THIS season because of distance...being hit from a yard away, like this one. So why is this handball but not Romero vs United? Yeah. This actually made me go read the IFAB rules. It’s so fucking unclear Yup.  This time it was a good process He originally pointed for a corner. Linesman had a bettter view of the Odegaard handball and didnt overrule the reds original decision, which imo (as an Arsenal fan) was more blatant.  Not saying it’s wrong but it does seem it always goes this way for City Acting like you didnt do this in the derby last year for the first goal. Rich. Are you saying you honestly believe City get special treatment? And you still watch the sport? What's that experience like? Must be really frustrating. If I were you I'd rather not watch something like that, would not be good for mental health. Coming from a utd fan when bruno does this for a small fucking foul is comical. Every fucking team does this and there is barely any booking. Calm the fuck down No they don't? No one gets penalised for it Same with managers being out of their technical areas, enforced for a week then gone Ah yes a fine. Which clearly had fuck all for an effect Monetary punishments are pointless when you are owned by a nation state. Doesnt matter if its not in game Because 'Man City bad and evil' i mean hounding the ref actually changing the decision, especially when there is VAR right there You really think prem ref's this season have been ""expertly enforcing"" matches LMAOOOOO Martin tyler could do 10x better You see, Luton have more power than Liverpool and Arsenal in the Prem. They are in bed with City and UAE. Needs to be a yellow every time, everywhere, no matter the team or the context. Otherwise this will continue. But the inconsistency is really bad, and we do get away with lot. Lol every city fan mentioning the fine just doesn’t get it. A fine does absolutely fuck all. Players are supposed to be booked for crowding the ref. That is what would actually have an impact on city as opposed to fining them less than what their owners can find in their couch cushions. He is not entitled to defend in a way that forces him to use his arms to make himself bigger. Not complicated. So? It's still a handball. There's no proof it was going out from this angle. The only reason people are discussing whether it's a penalty or not is because it's city. This is a blatant pen. I still remembered when Jack holding his arm up in last year FA Cup Final match when AWB accidentally shot the ball on his left arm which result penalty. I don't know what the interpretation of the rule is but it is what it is. An United flair defending City from Arsenal and Liverpool fans. That was a different situation though. Ødegaard made a sliding tackle with his arm above his head? Liverpool don't get reffed the same by English refs. We never have this much shit in Europe and there is a reason why. Yet, every single thread about a handball decision in filled with “I don’t understand the rules anymore” comments. So it clearly isn’t something that just happens in City games. The rules are confusing and the refs are shit. and then Odegard can play handball When it's not a deliberate effort to use their arm, but a natural part of their movement. When they are too  close to avoid it and again, in a natural position. When a close deflection changes the flight of the ball so that it hits you before you can react. Bang on. He takes that in the face hed be out cold, game stops for 10 minutes while the stretcher comes out. What happened to ball to hand? What happened to pens given for deliberate handball ? Wheres the common sense ? You are right, that one came to mind when watching this one. It was from a free kick right? The player who then when on to score the winner with his teams only shot on target. Yeah counts as being shafted lol. Maybe watch more games? That’s literally what happened Yeah sure, I mean that's how the constantly incorrect regulatory body have written it, sure. They all cry conspiracy while having Fly Emirates (Same country as City's owners and opposite carrier airline) and Visit Rwanda (Same Rwanda that the government is getting slated for having human rights problems) plastered on their shirts.   The cope is definitely real, but it's different when it's their team. Myriad of arsenal fans on about corruption over a stonewall penalty like odegaard diddnt get away with controlling the ball with his hand on Sunday >  did you notice that only City's rivals flairs are complaining ?   I did  The problem is that's the VAST majority of this subreddit, LOL They already are. I have seen comments from Liverpool flairs saying ""So, this is a pen but last season we had a similar situation and..."" This subreddit is hilarious  His arms are miles above his head, nowhere near his body, and he blocks the shot with his arms  Crystal clear pen, no matter how much y'all cry about it > completely natural position to throw into a shot like this  Having your arms above your head like that has never been deemed a natural position by refs... In what world is THAT a natural position?  Never been reffed that way The Everton defenders hands were in a natural position defending his face while he was attempting to tackle. He didn’t make himself bigger with his hands.   Neither should be penalties, that’s the point. But city get given these every time. He switched because of the assistant's input. It's not a conspiracy. I mean, it doesn't make sense for the ref to give it if he thinks it's a corner initially. If it's ""Clear and obvious"" they'll give it, if it's not they won't. Academic to the full time result but I really don't like the ref changing his mind like that It feels like less muddy water than the current rule. Look at the one we had against Palace where one of their defender's arms blocked a pass that was going to put Rashford through in the box with a chance. And the ref just shrugged and basically said too bad Could win a Champions League doing that! I still don't know why there's not something written into the rules that takes into account the opportunity an accidental handball stopped. Situations like this or that Mudryk header that was going wide against Arsenal should never be a handball. It's basically going from one team's goalkick to the other team's penalty based on a mishit shot striking an arm. Then every handball that occurs when people cross the ball shouldn't be pens either. As they definitely aren't going in and no idea if it's going to even lead to a chance and even then if that chance would be converted. Who said anything about clear.   Disagree on it being natural position it is? I swear we've had conversations this season about not giving pens because it was hit at someone from a yard away exactly like this one.   I'm annoyed cus I'm an Arsenal fan and I want City to lose, but I'm also genuinely confused. I don't know what the benchmark is for hand ball anymore. What about Ødegaard a week ago ? Oxalade- Chamberlain has entered the chat  Too bad the ref thinks it’s Gibbs > Pens cannot be subjective  You're watching the wrong sport if you want objective officiating decisions only Have you ever played yourself? It's an extremely natural position to have your arm in Yes, it is. Where do you put your arms when you move your body that way? Not by your side. Glad we’ve cleared that up, cheers mate What a cogent argument you make. exactly. the handball law has been officiated in wildly inconsistent ways. In fact, I think it’s one of the main types of decision where officials can show bias.  City is often very fortunate, with decisions that are usually inconsistent often going in their favor. That, along with them not being punished for blatantly violating financial rules makes them just an absolutely despicable club It doesn’t matter even if a City player had been kicking it towards their own goal, a handball is a handball. But it was a pen Oh yeah, I'm sure all of Liverpool's calls that season were fair and had no controversy at all, errors only happen in City matches ...  lmao what a joke this sub has become He had his arm out and it hit him in the arm makes himself bigger with his arm away from body and blocks the ball, always been a pen So far this season Tottenham have managed to have a goal against them disallowed due to refs not talking properly, and avoided 2 red cards earlier in the Chelsea game (they eventually got both anyway) but city are getting preferential treatment? Think you might just be paying more attention to some teams than others mate. which is wrong anyway, he made the call as soon as the assistant told him it was a pen He was simply using the ball as a buoy to get to shore, can't really fault him. You’re literally the only person who doesn’t see him move his arm towards the ball even after he slipped. VAR doesn't make these decisions where there is subjectivity involved. The referee does. If VAR felt like he missed something they might recommend him to go the monitor but ultimately its down to the ref to make the decision. And Luton got one for this same kind of thing recently. Getting one call wrong (the one everyone on the sub can name looking through the comments) doesn't mean the other ones didn't happen The irony in saying this. He literally was talking to his assistant. Jon Champion even mentioned it on the broadcast. Yes. His assistant obviously said something to change the call. No wants city to lose more than me. Doesn't mean I'm going to be an emotional baby about it. Waving his arms above his head is a natural position? it blocked a shot, regardless of where the shot was going it was literally always going to be given You can’t have your hand in the air to block. I know what you’re saying but you have to avoid doing that in the box. Most players keep their hands low If that’s a pen the rules need changing, such bollocks Do you know what's a natural position? Hsnd way out of your body is not a natural position, doesn't matter the posture. It’s what it would do if you wanted to block a shot. You have to keep them low in the box Yeah, if the Odegaard one is nothing, then so was this.  This one even less so because dude doesn't move his arm. Death, taxes, David Coote being a corrupt cunt This was a more unnatural position That should have been a pen too. Why should that matter, if that should matter. Most times it is a handball people have their hand in a natural position for them. Same with the Ødegaard one against Liverpool was natural and should off been a pen. People move and their hands have to follow. The pen is clear. And u should rather talk about what the pen rule is. Insane to say this as if there haven’t been weird borderline handball calls and no-calls all season. Acting like this is City only and not weird handball rules and inconsistent referees is interesting but you do you Yeah, poor little Liverpool FC, never get any dubious calls in their favor Because it got checked by VAR initially who agreed with the lineman's view. So no need to send the referee anywhere. Did you forget the derby last season where 10 of your players protested a correct given call, and forced the referee to overturn his decision? United fans talking about crowding players 🤣 Thing is, I didn't event bet for city lol. I bet for more then 2,5 goals in the game, because it was profitable No, it wasn’t very obvious which is why it’s a major talking point still.   City’s penalty today? Very similar, and a stonewall pen.   Odegaard? Right on the cusp It didn't happen for United vs Spurs. Romero handball. Clear and obvious but wasn't given even when the shot was on target.   How did Kovacic survive the Arsenal game? He should have been sent off. 99% of the time City will get decisions in their favor. Lol poor city, had an advantage (wrongly) ruled out, not a legitimate goal, and wolves? Don’t even get me started on wolves.   The referees are objectively just shit; however they are far less shit to certain clubs and the data over the VAR era clearly bears that out. It’s starting to become too weird to be just an outlier and patterns are forming. You’re so used to getting literally every call you actually believe that. Fucking pathetic. Yeah, I really preferred it when it was intentional for a penalty. I kinda wish there was a slightly lesser punishment for accidental hand balls such as maybe an indirect free kick or something. This hand ball was stupidly harsh on Everton. [deleted] The issue is that the on field ref guesses and unless his guess is implausible it stands. So it’s a total crapshoot with VAR basically there to over turn penalties that don’t hit a hand or to award penalties for the most egregious cases. It would be so much better if a set of guidelines were issues and all decisions were taken by video ref. It depends which kit you are wearing. It depends on which team are appealing for it [deleted] Coin flip that very often ends up in Man City’s favour He was a Chelsea supporter chatting shit prior to the season started, deleted all his comments, and now never talks about Chelsea. It's fucking funny as shit. How do i get the liverpool flair? Enlighten us. There were quite a few bodies in between the referee and the ball. You can see him running sideways to try and get a better angle. The linesman must’ve had a better view otherwise the ref wouldn’t have looked at him for advice. And linesman’s told him yep that’s hit his arm above his head it’s a pen. You don't think at least one City player should have been booked in this sequence? They are absolutely cheating and I hope they get what they deserve.   Did you read the article? The article is based on denied request by the Athletic for FOI. So we have no idea what was said, but considering UAE stance has always laughably been it’s not a state run club, can’t imagine much. VVD asked the referee if he has been drinking? Did he get booked or retrospective punishment? Ah yes, cause Bruno didn't rack up 5 yellows purely from complaining to the ref and Dalot wasn't booked off with 2 yellows in the space of 5 seconds. ""Hit"". Ok mate. Think you need to check the definition of ""hit"" before talking shite Fuck me, the stupid shit people just make up  He brushed past the linesman, who would call that a hit. Dalot got sent off for throwing his arms up, you melon our rightbacks aren’t allowed to swing their arms though [deleted] Yeah and Dalot gets away with being red carded for talking back to a ref while poor old Darwin gets sent off for the same thing….wait what? Could have killed him. ""Let me sarcastically joke even though half of what I'm saying is true"" They do mention the time it took Van Dijk to get off the pitch but it wasn't a significant factor in their decision. But we’re not comparing it to Dalot we’re comparing it to VVD. Dalot’s decision was incorrect imo not arguing that. People arguing staying on after being sent off and swearing at the ref is comparable to screaming fuck then arguing are beyond bias. Blatantly not true lmao most teams don't win trebles ace reading comprehension mate You mean people who actually like to have reasonable conversation in this subreddit rather than whatever the fuck rattles around in your infant maturity head? It has nothing to do with ""defending City."" It's just a totally unreasonable comment to say everyone else gets booked for this.  Your need to talk shit outstrips any desire for reason. Like a toddler throwing a tantrum, enjoy continuing to ruin this sub 🤡. Again like a toddler, people like you in this sub are toddlers playing in their own shit It's not defending City, it's pushing back on the ridiculous conspiracy shit. Van Dijk got a three game ban for crowding the ref? The penalty was for the handball, hope this helps mate 👍 can you try saying that again, but without crying? it’s hard to understand you tough to tell from that angle but if the ball hits his sleeve it’s not a handball according to the rules David Coote has got a suspiciously dodgy record for Liverpool and City.  Like to the point where he makes it very difficult to not accuse him If you watched this game and thought the ref favored city then you’re a clown lol. Really you can't, 2 completely different incidents. The magic word that allow them to do whatever the fuck they want. Then why wasn't idegaard penalised last week? He was making a sliding tackle. You need your arms out for balance, how can he do this with arms behind his back? He didn’t look like he was trying to block a shot with his arms, the only shot he could block was one that wasn’t going anywhere near the goal It rarely is actually in an “unnatural” position, arms go all over the place for balance. That terminology feels like a lazy catch-all to me. As usual, the rules are the problem. Your hands should not be so high up above your head, for starters I mean I think it’s harsh but it’s reffed consistently, he’s going to ground and raised his arm making himself bigger Wasn’t everyone in agreement back then that it should’ve been a penalty and that Man Utd got screwed over there? And the worst part is that it’s unclear *because* they’ve tried to make the law more objective.  As recently as 2016, the law only stated it was an offence if a player “handles the ball deliberately”. Now they’ve added so much in an attempt to make it objective that you could now make pretty much any decision on hand ball and be correct.  We shit on the referees a lot in this sub, but I’m pretty sure refereeing isn’t really getting worse, but the rules are definitely getting worse. But for the fact that it wasn't really a penalty, sure If the linesman thinks it was a supporting arm for Odegaard then he's not going to call it. For Onana, that clearly wasn't an option. Bruno literally got booked yesterday after a villa player illegal blocked him from taking a free kick, WTF are you talking about? Especially after dalot only just got a BS red card because the ref couldn't see who the ball went out on.  And I made one comment? WTF is this ""calm the fuck down"" BS? Get a fucking life weirdo. Are you stupid? People have gotten red cards for doing that There was like a 4 week stretch where Arsenal was penalised every game for it Tomiyasu literally got a red for it Maybe your team would do better if they threw their arms up to appeal things instead of throwing them up to block shots and give away penalties ;) Honestly think the reason Haaland did it is because the ref knew he'd fucked up. Absolutely not an excuse, but I think ref was thinking ""I can't book him for being angry at that call I've absolutely fucked"" Yeah tbf, wasn’t giving it until Jack said it was handball. Good point Refs are just inconsistent. We got away with crowding ref but Tarkowski got away with it today. He basically did what Rodri has been criticized to do for the past few seasons but even worse. He was fouling everywhere. Same with Hwang and same with Conor Gallagher. This is why I find it corny when people say we pay the refs when there has been many instances where Man City have been done dirty by the ref. But it's literally inconsistent for every team. Hell it happens both ways in some games. Newcastle v Arsenal 3 Newcastle players get yellows for surrounding the ref after the Havertz tackle. Then 0 arsenal players get yellows for doing the same thing after the goal. So players should just be running with their arms tuckered behind their backs when they are anywhere near the ball? As your massive oversimplification would require that. So he’s not blocking a shot I’m discussing it because I’m an Everton supporter dingus Crazy world I know, I do hate city but I'm pretty impartial when it comes to refereeing. Good thing intent is not required. You are acting like he had no other choice than to do what he did So the actual solution is to not dive in front of a ball to block it if you can't get your hands out of the way first.  His hands were in a natural position when diving like that. However he dived to block the shot and his arms were extended. So essentially took the risk blocking the shot that if it hits his arms it's a pen. Clearly he wasn't in a position to try and block the shot without his arms out. IIRC, yes. It was from some sort of setpiece or something. Honestly dont quite remember, hahah sorry Cry me a fucking river, shall we add up all the points you would have dropped in the games rodri should have had second yellows? Basically every game. Fuck it, foden could have had two yellows today for the amount he’s been screaming at the ref.  Absolutely clutching at straws crying over a non given yellow card. Remove your tinfoil hat would ya If it fucks over Liverpool they will give the decision. City and Arsenal getting a free one to save them. Which is strange as apparently no one cares about us at all. He's sliding in to block a shot, impossible to keep your arms by your side doing that.   > Never been reffed that way  Except it has. The Shaw one is completely unrelated and not similar at all, you're just saying his name because it happened against Liverpool. Theres no situation where something like that is even looked at because its not even close to a pen. “that the ref actually waited for his linesman to confirm” he didn’t wait tho. like I said he motion towards a corner then changed his decision. I didn’t say it was a conspiracy lol. I don't know what game you were watching, but the ref doesn't give a corner, he looks for confirmation from the linesman, who said penalty, so he gave the penalty.  And youre also parroting ""clear and obvious"" incorrectly. That term only applies to a call which the ref made to be overturned. Would have needed spurs to atleast turn up to that game and score 1 for that penalty to mean nothing > I still don't know why there's not something written into the rules that takes into account the opportunity an accidental handball stopped.  There is something in the rules; if the handball had blocked a ball that was going into the goal there would have been a red card as well as a penalty. Yup.  City only benefited from this handball, never-mind the penalty, because it at least kept the ball in play for them. Those aren’t going straight out of bounds…  Way to miss the point! You try making a tackle without moving your arms from your side and let me know how it goes I mean, yeah they're shit it their jobs, so not 100% percent of the time, but these where they block shots (on or off target) with the arm away from the body and it's not part of falling or jumping are given a lot. Saliba v Chelsea (despite jumping and the ball going a mile of target), Romero v. Arsenal, just in our games.   I've written pages on pages about the stupidity of application of the handball rule and it's flukey nature, but I don't think you can write a way to enforce the rule, where these are not pens. Don't understand your question at all, because it has got nothing to do with this situation. I imagine my flair, or?  But to answer your question, they've luckily done a bit to root out some of the flukey aspects. Players falling (like Ødegaard), ball bouncing off body parts, some aerial duels.  I thought that could be explained pretty easily last week, but upon reading the ""Salah-pushed-offside""-thread yesterday, I think I learned that some people will never understand the rules.  I'd love to be outraged about officiating in City games. I've probably been so 4-5 times this season, with reason. I just don't see the reason here. Agree with the human element but that's why we have the techs. Imagine how much effort from teams goes towards the results. The prep and then the mental situation post result. With so much technology now, it shouldn't be subjective anymore. One rule applies to all. Regardless of the team I support. Especially with handballs lol. By this sub's definition pretty much any arm movement is natural.  If this wasn't an handball every defender would just open their arms like that to stop shots, kinda defeats the whole purpose of football Natural position. Stop being dumb. Cheers. Wasn't talking to you. Go get some cheese curds and take a lap. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60572525 not when city handballs it tho I said the law is awful you idiot. I didn’t say it’s not a pen.  they often don’t follow the law for other teams Have you ever slid before? he doesn’t make himself bigger. His arm is a few inches in front of his face to protect his face I agree. It's the difference between coincidence and causation. Try running and falling like that and keeping your hands down He's not waving though is he. His arm is moving to cover his face. It's not outstretched at all. This is an egregious decision. Depends on the team considering I watched Rodri dribble the ball with his hand in that exact same box 2 years ago and nothing was given [deleted] It's blocking his face. The arm is not outstretched. He isn't waving it. It's crooked. But you can’t move around properly with your arms low. It’s not supposed to be the rule that attackers can run freely in the box but defenders have to act like penguins. Why should it matter? It always matters. They always take into consideration ""Is the arm in a natural position?"". We had two legit goals disallowed just yesterday. Yeah I did forget , but not other team itl does it as much as city does and gets away with it . You literally see his foot slipping on the grass. The City pen isn't similar at all as the defender makes a challenge for ball and in that motion lifts his arm. There is nothing accidental about his actions. If you can't even see how Odegaards foot slips then I really don't know what to tell you our last 3 games have had loads of shitty calls lmao stop it. luton players could've murdered someone on the pitch and the refs wouldn't have batted an eye. there was a foul on bernardo in the build up to the penalty against palace. and now this game everton players can hack, pull, push, and whatever else and get away with it sadly if you dont pressure the ref they dont give it   even if you do, they'll only give it if you wear a shirt they like My guy, I did not mention any other penalty anywhere in what I said. The handball law changes so often and is constantly applied differently due to the subjectivity, that I can no longer confidently predict what is and what isn't a penalty.   Just because I'm a Liverpool fan doesn't mean I must be thinking about them when I make a comment. Just keep whining here constantly, it'll appear after a while https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/wiki/flair He can’t, I think he realized how terrible his thought process was Whatever you need to help you sleep at night. Oh definitely, more than one even. Just not a big fan of comparing entirely different incidents. Was a fair question and he DID NOT put hands on him… Honestly, that's a Bruno Fernandez thing. United are getting normal decisions now, rather than constantly favoured in the PL like City and Newcastle. Wonder what they have in common, wouldn't be because that they pay money to referees to officiate in their own leagues? fernandes only having 5 yellows for complaining is still very generous to him.  dalot case is yet another that proves haaland not getting a ban makes no sense though The Dalot Double has to be the most infamous call this season; and for it to be the same muppet that gave Martinelli a double yellow (which, while annoying, he at least had two definitive actions to hide behind).   You can argue about bad objective calls, like the failed goal overturn for Liverpool which was a failure in communication more than a poor call. You can argue that Bruno deserved a red and Gabriel was fouled before Gordon’s goal, but those are rule interpretations.   The place where bias truly lives is where officials enforce minor rules in one case, but ignore 90% of them. This allows them to really affect matches and is a perfect place for their bias to fester since their calls can be argued as technically correct. our rightwingers did it anyway I don’t recall this actually happening lol wtf So true man so true. You showed him who’s boss! im rereading it and it doesn’t, unless im missing a longer statement:  > ""It's alleged that the defender acted in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or insulting words towards a match official after being sent off in the 29th minute."" Yeah, we'll see how long that lasts once your finances catch up to you. [deleted] You think Liverpool fans can read? He had the gall to say something to him. I’m sure all the man city players were extremely respectful in this situation. Yeah and nothing to do with the 5 City players swarming the ref as per We are on about the VAR ref here City “fans” always too scared to flair up on the main sub. I don't know. Everyone is frustrated with the officials I'm just explaining what I think the refs interpretation was here. Arm was down by his side. Arm being above your head is always going to give a handball even if it's in a natural position Cos of the height of the hand, it's one of the factors they look at.  Also this one was given on the field.  He had his hand out to rebalance after slipping.  No idea how that incident even comes to mind for people. Because he's a Manchester ref. Go look at the underlying stats these guys are giving against Liverpool and then the other 5 big teams. If it 'evens' itself out then we wouldn't permanently not just be outliers but straight up anomalies over the past 5 seasons.   Tierney did his best to stop us winning yesterday and City struggling? No worries here have a pen which we haven't been giving all season. Odergaard decisions was madness and lets not forget Diaz where we scored an onside goal. Odegaard was not penalized because he was falling and his arms were by his side. There was no intention to make himself bigger or deliberately block the ball. VAR said arm was moving toward his body. Not a handball.  In this case the player jumps in with his arms up to block a shot. I think it's harsh because when you slide in your arm does go up like that naturally, but the common interpretation of this is that it is using your arms to make yourself bigger to block the shot.  Remember that these are subjective calls but both good and correct decisions per the law and guidelines. It is not above his head. Go pause the video when it hits his arm, stop saying this. No they had the refs on sky explaining how it was the correct call at the time actually Isn't that what people are complaining about? This was a penalty based on the Prem's interpretations. Having your hands raised is going to be a pen 99% of the time. There’s no objective standard for it, this could be justified either way. Yeah I’m not arguing against the intervention, simply pointing out it always seems to happen when it benefits City You dont know football if you think only city gets away with crowding the ref. All the teams do it. Get you head out of the bias. Knobhead Once in a blue moon with zero consistency, it happens in most games and nothing happens.   If they were consistent, no one would do it. Did you forget the /s? Or can you post a source cause that claim is bonkers. Yeah, 4 week stretch, then nothing. A city player got carded in the first game of the season for it if I remember correctly, then I watched the rest of the games in the following weeks where players did it and nothing happened. When? Which game? He got a red card in August for time-wasting and then fouling someone, 2 yellows. You're not allowed to post sensible comments here, mate. Only comments that confirm their bias against Man City. Im saying he is not entitled to throw his arms up in the air but if thats the line you want to draw from it then go ahead lmao He sure is Well you don't need to get mad. This is only a sport. Go touch some grass if a sport makes you this mad... It should be when the shooter is that close.  You're acting like you don't understand basic patterns of movement during sport.   Youre acting like the alternative makes sense and isn't completely unrealistic impairment that would give the attacking team a huge advantage. He had no time to move his arms out of the way. Are you crazy ? City have broken you mentally. It’s hilarious. Least unhinged Liverpool supporter Sure Yeah we are the ones crying😂. Ironic coming from the whiniest fanbase on earth It's a conspiracy that the handball rules have been officially altered several times over the last several years? Guarantee that if it happened against city they’d get the penalty. Oh yeah, that's bogus. He made a decision himself, then corrected it. Has nothing to do with them yelling though. Yeah they might be going straight to the opposition in open play. Instead it's a penalty. So same difference. Lol His arm was over his fucking head mate, that's not natural. That's a terrible idea. Except his arm is extended out from his body, how is that natural? Wrong Great, one bad call. Nice one. every single club gets away with shit, there is no grand conspiracy just confirmation bias I don't care if you think the law is great or atrocious. If you want to discuss it, do it and elevate a claim to the FA. > 2 years ago  Brother the rules changed since then it was also blocking a shot whilst raised above his head No but if you block a shot directly with your arms it’s always a pen. It was too obvious in this case. What is a natural position then? Ødegaard is and that should off been a pen. When I move my hands naturaly follows me. And when stuff/the ball comes my direction i would naturaly/ try to move or Block it with my arms. But if u do that it is a handball. The part where should talk about natural positsjon is Just stupid and should either be removed or be made more clear what natural means in th rule Book.  And I think it would be better to Just compleatly remove it and Just put down what the call should be compeared to were ur arm is. Because how it is not Just leaves it up to what the People and refs think natural position is. Oh ok, so we should just go back and rescind Curtis Jones red card from earlier this season bc he literally slips on the grass! I replied to the wrong person. It was for one above. I'm geniunely curious what they meant by common sense hahah.   I've read ""common sense"" a lot yesterday as well, when people were outraged about Harvey Elliott's correctly disallowed goal. Something like using common sense and just ignoring that Salah was offside because he was pushed. I mean you can go and watch it back and that’s clearly what happens. Or you can just be in denial How am I comparing them? I just find it funny that one bookable offense led to a yellow card and another one didn't It was very festive; making sure nobody went thirsty in this period Well he has 6 now actually but considering he's captain its pretty obvious he isn't getting away with it. He shouldn't have been sent off for it - but I can understand people wanting it happening Tell us how it is to live such a persecuted life as a City fan? Really must be difficult when people keep harping on cheating and associating with immoral tyrants when all that matters is Haaland's goal record It wasn't in their statement. It was in the ruling. You can find it on the FA website under ""written reasons"". well we won it already so it doesn't matter lol i'm obviously just going to say it again lol why bother:  most teams don't win trebles Man I wonder what it’d be like if there was some sort of a system that would correct calls missed by the referee🤔 Okay and? The ref on the field has much more control. It was a pen. But the constant fouls from Everton players uncalled All I want is consistency, but the rules seem to change every week. I'm more frustrated with the over the top reactions from fans comparing different things and acting like rules aren't subjective in general. What about romero vs man u? Was a fairly similar position and distance. And Everton guy had his hand out to balance as well. One was gonna hit the Everton player in the face or be kicked out the stadium. The other was for a free 1v1 against the keeper. I’m not saying you’re wrong I’m just frustrated about having no idea what will be called besides favoring the ruling on the field That non-decision against Man Utd was an exception though. People were pissed at that not being called because it usually does (and it usually should be). I know, I guess I'm just pointing out that this is an easier call for a linesman to overrule the ref since there's no mitigating factor. Not going to respond to what I said? Just ignoring it won't make it go away 🤡 I thought bruno always got away with it..... Just this year Dalot got a red card and Lewis dunk also got a red card Ah, forgot which rule it was that got him a bullshit yellow that they then never applied to anyone else. Lewis dunk then. His arm movement is entirely consistent with making a block tackle the way he did. It happens 100s of times every weekend.  He hasn't thrown his arms up in an effort to make himself bigger and the ball still could have hit him if it hadn't hit his arm.   So there's not even an advantage.  Someone reading your comment would think he dived like a keeper to stop it.  You sound like a troll or someone who's never kicked a ball. If the shot was on target it wouldn’t have hit his arm I’m making fun of you lol I understand the movement, he is not entitled to make it. Blocking whots with your arms would give a huge advantage to the defending team That's actually my point. So it means if you dive in like that you will run the risk of a penalty. What could you possibly have to whine about  Unlimited money  Any players you want  Break what ever rules you want  Pay off ref's  Win every trophy ever  Rinse and repeat until the end of time  God it must be so hard to not complain as a city fan he was sliding.. I know most reddit users don’t get off the couch unless to grab another bag of doritos but that is natural when you slide. hes protecting his face you fucking whopper One bad call that handed them the league. Along with tons of smaller, less obvious decisions throughout the year. With VAR, there is absolutely no excuse for something this ridiculously wrong.  And now with officials going to UAE for extra paychecks, i think it is completely fine to insinuate that city gets better treatment. They’re the ONLY club in english football that I will make this argument for in the current day. yes, everyone has famously been so happy with the refs since then. the nasty VAR was banished, because it was haunted it’s not a grand conspiracy, the league definitely favors city over other clubs.  Just have a look at the match right now. We have City, a club that has blatantly violated financial rules without any sort of punishment at all, playing against Everton, who were deducted 10 points for a single violation. And you’re telling me that every club gets away with shit?  Ok yeah man, I believe you. It’s all equal and City doesn’t get special treatment.  I even think that the officials did a good job. By the handball law, I think this was a pen. The issue is that you get examples from other matches constantly where basically the exact same thing happens and they DONT give a penalty. City is often extremely favored with decisions that are usually inconsistent. The fact you don’t care if the laws of the game are good or not speaks volumes It’s more of the arm being raised above the head I think. We’ve had plenty of shots that hit arms/hands in NATURAL positions and no penalty given. But the moment the arm raised above head it’s deemed unnatural. That just isn’t true. Show me the rule that says that. If the ball hits an arm that is in a natural position, and where the defender has not moved the arm to try and block the shot, then it’s not necessarily hand ball. Fairs Exactly, I made my own comment in the situation and it seems a lot of Liverpool fans were saying they should let the offside goal stand because he was pushed… it’s either a penalty or offside the refs can’t play advantage on an offside, strange set of supporters >one bookable offense led to a yellow card and another one didn't  English is not my first language, but that looks like a comparison to me. He still pushed a lino and didn't face any action It’s really tough man. Every night I cry myself to sleep because of our owners. I can’t possibly enjoy watching this team play when I know there are bad things going on behind the scenes. Can you imagine if companies from the UK /US whose products you use every day had anything bad going on behind the scenes? You wouldn’t use any of their products ever ah.  regardless, i feel like storming a ref after a game to yell “fuck off” at them and then tweeting “wtf” about a decision the ref made should meet the standard for behaving in an improper manner. you can have titles taken away retrospectively, if you do something like, i don't know, cheating finances to the tune of 115 violations It’s famously utter shite though isn’t it Ambiguous rules favour city, how is that not consistency? Consistency over the same game week is a myth let alone a season, consistency during one game is the what we should be hoping and often get. In the Prem, height of the hand is one of the things they look at if it's at or higher than he shoulder the odds of it being given go up.  I think these ones are soft, I also think it's a natural position and he hasn't tried to handle it but the height factor and (as you say) that it was given on field meant it was going to be a penalty.  I think this one is more interesting if the ref doesn't give it, to see if the height waa enough on it's own.  It's just impossible to be consistent with this kind of decision, if anything the rule has gotten worse due to them trying to make it more objective.  As long as something similar didn't happen at the other end in this game I can live with it. [deleted] Lewis Dunk got a red card for saying something abusive and insulting to the referee. Dalot got two yellow cards for not stopping his dissent against the referee, that one seemed harsh to me. I’d like to see crowding the ref gone from the game, but if there’s no dissent or abuse when they’re crowding the ref then they’re not the same thing. A second yellow you mean? Doubt anyone has got a straight red for it. Can you share a gif or replay link? Second yellows don't count either for this example. Yeah because im not agreeing with you i have to be a troll, are you 15?  His arm is up in the air and he blocked a shot, the only thing that is making you say it shouldn’t have been a pen is because you are biased But it wasn’t and it did..? Lol that's actually funny If intentional, he didn't super man dive. This is where the whole unnatural and ""silhouette"" discussions have come into play over the years.  Because without amputating your arms, they are always going to make your body bigger. yes, i'm sure he gained a huge advantage here by preventing a goal kick for his own team... The ball was whacked towards him in a split second. He didn't dive anywhere because he didn't have time to Yet we are still outspent by Man U and Chelsea   Yet we didn’t have a functioning LB or striker for years  We have the best lawyers   ???  We only consistently won the league Basically everything u said was bs Outing yourself right here lad, clueless. There are probably thousands of calls that over the season contributed to one team winning over the other. There’s no way you can in good faith reduce it to one call. Unless you can name them all. City are still awaiting trial so they can't be given a punishment yet. It's a combination of irrational thinking due to being emotional and not properly knowing how the game works.  I started reffing a few years back. The amount of crazy and ill-informed takes you see on here is insane. I can tell English is not your first language, don't worry nah mate we already won it, look at wikipedia You think VAR wouldn’t have given that handball given the current rules? I don’t think a closet City fan would be as active on r/chelseafc as I am personally Lewis dunk got a straight red and I believe dalot got two straight yellows for the same dissent which is basically a straight red No google it yourself. Lewis dunk got a straight red Sure, just invent my reasoning and then insult me for something you invented. Great work. It's because you are trying to oversimplify something and build your argument on that basis.  If that was the case, any time a ball hit a defenders hand it'd result in a pen, which isn't true.  That alone proves you wrong. I don't see this as his arm being ""up in the air"" - his arm is across his body in a way consistent with everyone who is sliding to make a challenge. His arm is in a completely natural position. I'd like to see where you expect his arm to be in this scenario. So he wasn’t blocking a shot with his arm Thanks sweaty You would be fuming if you didn’t get that pen and you know it. A defender is not entitled to block a shot with his hands, period. That was not the only option onana had, he took a risk and it didn’t pay off Since when is it relevant if the ball is going off target? Are you for real now? How else did he end up there if not diving to block a shot. And dove in a way that left his arms up. He didn't slip, he literally dove to block a shot. aww was Aguero and a new £50m LB every other year not good enough Unlimited money doesn't mean most money spent  Wtf are you talking about you played a false 9 system that didn't need a striker???   The best lawyers lmao nice cope bro  ????  Only consistently win at least 2 trophies every year. Not good enough for oil city fans  Basically everything you said was BS what are you even on about? when you go from standing to stretching/sliding quickly you shift your weight backwards and throw your body at the ground resulting in your arms raising.  edit- bristol city flair but only post in city subs lmao talk about outting yourself… anyone else smell plastic?? Based on what? I'm curious. Dickhead Again, you can have titles taken off you retrospectively. If the ref didn't then no it wouldn't [deleted] Lewis dunks was 2 yellows, 21 seconds apart.  Dalot was also 2 yellows.  This is if you are on about this season anyway. https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/13017463/ref-watch-was-lewis-dunk-right-to-see-red-8216he-went-too-far  So abusive language for Dunk apparently - different scenario than crowding ref in general.  Sit tight...   This 2nd yellow? https://youtu.be/P2iinsjwOuY?si=GsXPshn-ibNeVBOc  If there weren't other examples you were referring to then can we agree that these are different scenarios and red cards for crowding the ref don't actually appear to happen? Disagreeing with you is the only thing that i have done here. Almost every comment you have made has had some personal dig in it and that was mu first and you are now trying to play the victim?   Im not saying that it should always be a pen when it hits your arm, why are you putting words in my mouth? Do you not have a functioning argument for something i actually said? Yes he was He was. A shot can be off target. A player shot the ball, it was off target, the defender dived to block the shot and it hit his arms.  A shot doesn't stop being a shot if it isn't on target. Lol Not at all, you're projecting your own biases.  You're still acting like he consciously made a choice to put his arm out to block it, and showing that you don't understand basic logic, never mind football and defending. Per the rules it's not. im aware of that. I don't think the ref did anything wrong. The issue i have is that the guy just tried to block a shot on goal. instead he's punished because the attacker completely fucked up and shot it into row z, where the defenders arm just happened to be. it's not deliberate nor is it denying the offense any advantage or goalscoring opportunity. it's simply unlucky.  i'd like the rules to be written in a way that would allow this not to be a penalty. When aguero was a cripple yes that not good enough, and we played Fabian delph and Angelino for a while before Cancelo got into the system Lol i think you're confused mate, we already won them last year lol, you can search it on youtube That’s jokes That was never a handball man 😭 You just caught them on their lie. Players crowding refs have always been an issue and the only one that has been booked was van djik. Van djik is an outlier. This sub can be delusional sometimes. He was blocking a shot with his body He made sure his arm wasn’t blocking the target Why are you so mad Im an arsenal fan how exactly am i biased?  I didn’t say it was intentional at any point. I understand what you are saying, it’s just that none of it actually matters.  Why should the attacking team be punished because the only thing a defender knows how to do in that situation is use his arms to make himself bigger and block a shot with them? You dont have to consciously make a choice to stop a shot from your hand. Either way it gives the defending team an advantage, and its a pen if the arm is in an unnatural position Man doesn’t understand the word retrospectively 💀💀 Considering I've seen Odegaard dribble the ball in the box a week ago and nothing get called, I don't think so I totally get it though, the refs do suck and it's easy to misremember in the heat of the moment, especially if it supports your agenda. But yeah the delusion and over-generalization (especially of fan bases) runs strong on reddit in general. Many people see a flair and believe that comment applies to a whole fanbase, especially if upvoted. Damn looked like his arm But he still blocked a shot with it. I think you mean he didn't prevent a goal. But he still blocked a shot with it.   He the city player done a gentle chip pass and it hit is arm he wouldn't have stopped a shot and it would still be hand ball for blocking a pass with the arm. Even if the pass wouldn't have gone to anyone. You are projecting It should matter and often does, as we saw with your team in their last game.   Why do you keep saying that it's their only option. For one, that isn't what they are doing, he's using his arms to balance. You're still implying that their is intent by phrasing that way.  ...and I'm not presenting that argument you are.   You're creating a world where defenders only have 1 option, and it creates a HUGE disadvantage.  Good chat though, I'm off to bed! Thankfully, a former top referee was able to address that on the post match coverage by saying that it wasn't in an unnatural position, which is one of my points.  He still said it was a pen though, cause its a shit rule. 🎣 That’s fair enough, but I guess the slight thought od him ”falling” played heavily in his favour. Don’t think Onana (or whoever’s hand it touched) would have that benefit of doubt in his favour Nah he got that out of the way of the target If the shot was on target it wouldn’t have hit his arm No u The whole reason why it is a pen is because they don’t just have the only option. You are acting like thats the case. Unless thats the first time in his life he made that movement, he knows his arm goes up when doing so.  Handling the ball wasn’t intentional, sure. Making the movement where there is a good chance that happens was intentional. He is not entitled to do that. He took a risk and it didn’t pay off this time Not even successful ragebait we just think you're stupid No one is disagreeing with that. But the shot wasn't on target and it hit his arm that was extended. So penalty.   If anything you're making it sound a deliberate block by intentionally putting his arms out of the way. This blocking the ball from going over his head. okay mate 🎣 lol a deliberate handball for intentionally getting your arm out of the way nice Clearly wasn't out of the way though. The ball stuck his hand dead on. The destination of the ball isn't relevant. That's why there's handballs when people try passing or crossing.  You're argument is he didn't block a shot because it was off target. Well he did block a shot. His arm was out of the way It wasn't out of the way though. That's why the ball hit it. If it was out of the way then it couldn't have been hit. That's what out of the way means. How are you struggling with this. If the shot was on target it wouldn’t have hit his arm"

Spacing between them makes absolutely no sense with Alvarez in that position JULIAAAAAAAN JULIANNNNNNN  He’s been up for it so far Canada over-focused on Messi and gave De Paul WAY too much space in midfield there. Good pass from him, good run, first touch, and calm finish from Julian Whenever I see one of these threads, I remember that [Moyes turned down Julian Alvarez because he preferred Antonio](https://talksport.com/football/1304705/west-ham-david-moyes-julian-alvarez-transfer-man-ciity/) TREMENDO ÑOCA! VISTE ESO LOMBARDI? how are you this fast Never know if these are intended to go through the legs or not. JULIAN MY BELOVED Great pass from De Paul That ball control while playing on that terrible pitch...what a beauty of a goal When Alvarez hears it's a semi final, Alvarez scores. It is his destiny All these young Argentina players are picking up from Messi. That first touch from Alvarez is insane. Lovely pass, magical first touch. I am hard. The first touch was insane champagne Bombito no Sexy sexy first touch Alvarez went five-hole. Will see a lot more from this guy in the Olympics. Loving it SIII ARAÑAAA SIIIOOI What a goal TE QUIERO JULIÁN TE QUIERO An incredibly solid finishing by Alvarez. should be tagged as a great goal Awful defending. They gave him so much time and space to turn and pick a pass. fucking CLINICAL from the control to the strength to the patience in front of goal. Look Pep, look what happens when Julian plays as 9. Bruh Great ball and great first touch World class goal ANULO MUFA what a touch Great touch but really poor from Bombito. Didnt even look around to check where Alvarez was It's so unfair that City has both Haaland and Alvarez. What is Bombito doing Another system player created by pep huh OH NO NO NO NOOOOO The ball went right between the goalie's legs hahaha A great example of how a first touch can make something out of nothing. Sexo What a touch The most unenthusiastic commentator in the history of mankind. This video site is not working for me, the video stops the moment the page loads and there are no controls on it. In the recent past I could right click on the player and press play, now even that is impossible, sadly. Any help? Game over lol he really should be the main attacker of another team instead of City, wasted potential tbh Game over. Fml. Should’ve passed that , the keeper bailed him out , lol 😂 literally gasped as he perfectly lands it in front of him, actual sublime touch That first touch was MINT. That’s just quality brother. As much as our club tribalism makes us haters. Just gotta appreciate good talent imo   (Im still a hater tho) Great awareness to hold off the defender as well. He’s such a talent I know this will be the minority opinion but I actually think he gets lucky. I think he’s trying to put the ball on the other side of the defender and it just ends up laying perfectly for him That has been Canada. Good plays with poor final decision making/finishing this game has been incredible. So end to end and Canada were looking better before this They still are so it looks like it’ll be a competitive match, great spirit from Canada let's be honest, what are the chances canada win this match? >Insane first touch but also shocking positioning from the Canadian backline. Spacing between them makes absolutely no sense with Alvarez in that position  It was comical that they showed the offside lines from VAR. Canada's two CBs are easily the weakest part of their starting line-up unfortunately. They've both played well so far this tournament, but they're the clear weak spot when you go position-by-position and there's not a whole lot of depth there. Sadly…I had a bad feeling once I saw Julian all by himself with the ball… The midfield is equally to blame. They are extremely nonchalant  and not applying any pressure. Dude was able to turn around, dribble and pick out the pass like nothing.it looks like they shut off for a moment and it bit them. > Insane first touch  That’s a bit too much. His body language indicates that he was surprised it ended up in front of him. He was trying to drop it back and turn around the defender.  Good first touch, but nowhere close to insane. We are so blessed for having two quality strikers in Lautaro and Julian He and Lautaro work ridiculously hard off the ball. I know they have to pick up the slack for Messi, but it still jumps out to you how tenacious Argentina’s press is from the front. Classic tactical mistake trying to swarm Messi lol All 3 mids are capable of insane passing, dribbling, or scoring. Truly a golden era How was/is Antonio? Luckily Antonio is one of the most constant players hammers had in years, at least it's not that big of a flop since Antonio probably is the best signing in recent years, and mighty Payet but he was inconsistent LO VISTE RUSO? He’s from the future He takes over from u/psgacademy at night Really? This one was pretty clearly intentional, he had the time to pick a side if that’s what he wanted to try Trying his best Penalty to Argentina, for unsportsmanlike behavior  Edit: Second Penalty to Argentina, for David’s near miss Cry mate. Bombito's kinda lucky that he didn't bring him down there. Would have been a red and (probably) a pen Then the guy has mastered the skill of Luck Manipulation, look at his goal against Croatia. So many ""lucky"" moments.... Yeah, i LOVE Julián, I love him as if he was my own kid, and I know his first touch actually sucks 😭 Not minority opinion. This is exactly what happened. Good touch to bring it down but lucky in where it actually ended up. The final passes have actually been atrocious today. The space has opened up more than enough for an early goal David makes me want to rip my eyes out sometimes [deleted] they’ve actually been really really good, apart from the finishing, they were prolly even the better team Nill Luckily it's actually better now than World Cup (Victoria/Miller) which has helped us a lot this tournament. Still weak tho. Funny thing is this is the best CB partnership we've probably ever had. Bombito is extremely raw and makes mistakes like you saw on this goal. I pray we find some wingers after Di Maria and Messi retire because Nico ain’t it Higuain and Agüero could never I see Aguero and Tevez now where is the hiaguain regen? I will probably get hated for this, but for me Lautaro is a bit overrated, for me Lautaro needs more chances than Alvarez to make impact, and for me Julian Alvarez is worlds most underrated player there is, the guy is under a lucky star, at 22 he won it all and doesn't think to stop, he always deliveres in semifinals or finals simply this guy has all the skills including them balls. Pep got him for 25 mil which was a steal like no other, maybe Arda Guler is slightly bigger steal but Julian for me would always play before Lautaro, Lautaro would play if I need to keep the ball, Julian for Goals and liquid play As a Canadian can we borrow one plz midfielders’ and defenders’ worst nightmare >  insane passing, dribbling, or scoring.  That's very complementary to De Paul, lol He's a fan favourite but we've needed a proper striker for years now I’m not a pro. It’s just that it feels like a safer option to pick a side. I will never understand this banter.   France had two free penalties against us in the WC final, lol. Would have only been a yellow card if it was a pen, no double jeopardy anymore. Would have been a red if not a pen though Idk dude, he did it twice in like 65min of game time.. his first touch cant actually suck that much.  Admittedly i havent paid much attention to Julians first touch (even tho i watch every argentina game) but the 2 he had today were insane The field must be terrible. You can see the water when they slide or the ball bounces. And you can tell both teams have been a bit inaccurate with the passes I don't really watch his games but after watching these last few Canada games, I'm convinced his decision making is the slowest I've ever seen. He takes 2-3 seconds to make a decision which is way too long when you're attacking and under pressure. We've been obsessing over his potential move and this tournament didn't help his odds of one of the bigger clubs in the rumours. Marsch has his weaknesses as a coach for sure but I respect his attacking football In recent years. De Vos/McKenna were playing at higher levels and had a better partnership than anything we've seen recently. Lord and saviour suiiii garnacho to the rescue Lets merge our NTs honestly, as legendary as they have been for their clubs, after their international careers, I’d say that Argentina was due for a quality striker or two lol Higuaín would have totally missed that. Agüero would have hit the post Lautaro in the world cup De Paul is a good club player, but he has been a top 3 player for Argentina for the past 5 years. He also for some reason has incredible chemistry with Messi and plays  the quick one-two pass to Messi that creates so much space like 5 times a game De Paul isn't a scoring threat, but he is an insane playmaker for us. I will never forget his GOAT performance against Brazil in 2021. France had as many penalties in 2018 as Argentina in 2022, but no one says penalty to France Penalty to Argentina just rolls off the tongue better Sometime it's just your day, most of the time I find he lets the ball bounce a little bit too far from him. I like this explanation better than us just not being very good, thanks I was at the stadium.. As they were getting the field ready I saw they were spraying it with a large hose (for truck style). I thought it was kinda weird for a stadium like that to need hoses to spray the field? Also I could see that most of the water was just pooling in some spots.  It pretty much didn’t rain today and it was really hot Let him cook.  Joga champagne. It's not a final higuain scores, aguero would have been injured anyway. >  He also for some reason has incredible chemistry  Not even memeing they're great friends and that probably helps since they understand each other so well and are both great players.  Messi already said De Paul was great help when it came to including him into the group nicely. I think that is much more about Messi elevating everyone around him. I'm always skeptical of a) players under Guardiola and b) players alongside Messi. They always end up looking worse in different circumstances than those. You're right about De Paul, but he suddenly had a patch of poor form for Argentina during the World Cup. He seems to be back to his best now. A single assist that required Renan Lodi to fail miserably to go through? I get the emotional baggage that leaving a 30-year title drought carries for you guys, but it wasn't that great of a game from any single player. Mostly a big brawl (of kicking Neymar around) decided by an individual mistake. One less penalty but point still stands I mean, there's that too. Champagne bonito Messi elevating everyone around him didn't work very well pre-Scaloni. That wasn't even his best pass lol. The pass to Messi where he shockingly missed was his best pass, but he bossed the midfield and was great ik every aspect of the game.   Don't know why you are getting so in your feelings about this. I know you haven't won a WC in more than 2 decades, but don't get so emotional. It worked well with Sabella There is little difference between the 2014 and 2022 World Cups from Argentina, tbh. Both were decided by details that could have gone either way. Again, calling it a goat performance is... exaggerated, to put it mildly. But well, different standards, I guess. Yes before every attacking player got injured and we started playing very defensive. But I mostly meant those right before Scaloni, the eras of Sampaoli and Bauza."

Play as a fucking Shadow Striker, Simeone Not a great pass The pressing goat finally reaps what he sows. why is Genesio playing the B team in this game ? is he going for a draw ? this is so weird Yiiiikes that was careless. .. Atletico plays with three strikers? Defender had a parlay with an Alvarez goal ❤️ This could be Atlético's best season in a while.   In attack: they've added Sorloth and Alvarez while still having Griezmann.   In the midfield: Great depth. Koke, De Paul, Lemar, Llorente, and they've added Gallagher.  Defense: I feel like it's definitely weaker than it was a few years ago. It's a weird mix of people to me, but maybe that's just because they had such a consistent, solid line up for years.  I think that Atlético had the best summer signings with Sorloth, Gallagher, and Alvarez. In a knockout tournament, this team is going to be on the level of Madrid and City. Domestically, they'll be right behind Madrid and Barcelona, any unnecessarily dropped points from them and Atlético will swoop in. Investigate that defender for match fixing It used to be like this but then they started getting removed for copyright Reddit takes these clips down much faster I thought it was me, turns out those sites have been extra shitty lately People don’t post them on external sites for the sake of it, they do it because these videos get removed for copyright all the time.

I can't watch the Barca game and i have to go through those shit sites each time a goal is scored Goals zone is awesome. Fuck me, you can almost hear the ""EEEEEK!"" from the defender. Best presser in the world, no doubts about it. He's the only player that looks like he will take the ball when pressing a keeper. And so quickly into his debut, way to make an impact!  Seriously what is Genesio doing with this lineup some of these guys haven't played a minute in Ligue 1 this year lol I don't think Messi would be able to see that pass Imagine facing this for your first start of your professional career.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* My captain is Alvarez and my keeper is dubravka. “It’s a good height for the keeper” Good save tbh Hot take. Julian should be the main FK taker even if KDB is healthy. That FK at the edge of the area when he first came on, Julian would have buried it in with the form he is having with FKs. pretty ridiculous that the foul that led up to this attempt didn’t yield a yellow for Burn; then minutes later Bernardo got one for a similar foul but not as close to the box Good height, already inside the post and bending in towards the keeper, good save but one you’d expect a keeper to make. Looks great in slo mo! It’s a good save not a worldie Dubravka had a good game today he made many good saves Dubravka has really been on it past few weeks. Had a shaky start filling in for Pope but he's been saving a lot. Incredible save and incredible shot. Perfect height for a keeper. Should save that every time Okay Yes but he missed a sitter today. Not perfect. Needs to learn from Messi Messique wow Did he do anything else all game? One for the cameras that!!! True neutral Buffon really has a point with net height it really is a good height if you are 2 meters tall. Thanks for the honesty Hot take that Pretty controversial opinion ngl I think Julian is better for FKs like that one KDB missed that are near the penalty area. Julian even scored one of those earlier in the season against Wolves. That said, for ones far out but still in shooting distance I would probably take KDB still because I don't think Alvarez has even scored one like that yet For close range freekicks very near to the penalty area it should be Alvarez.  For those a bit further away definitly de bruyne. De bruynes freekicks have more power but dip less. Yeah I was sure Julian was going to score it but I saw KDB trying to cook and I said ""aight fair let him cook"". He cooked just not that FK Alvarez will be back on the bench when Haaland and De Bruyne are both back and will be back up  striker for Haaland again. Seeing Walker not get a yellow for completely barging Gordon before that, it’s definitely the result of referees being told to let games breathe… even if they then assign a yellow to Dias right after for a way lesser foul. A lot of shots at that speed make it in, even that far inside the post.   He moves his feet really fast when that ball is struck to make it look almost comfortable I think you're underplaying it a little bit, that's a quality free kick and we see those go in pretty frequently. I think he would have had it covered even if it was going right in the top corner, he made it look easy due to his positioning  Absolutely zero idea why this save has over 2k upvotes True true, I think this is also posted for Alvarez’s free kick technique which is great to see how he gets the dip over their tallest defender. Looking at the first angle you’d bet on it going in, then from behind you see it’s a medium difficulty save for Dubrovka but he also does well to anticipate. So just a great highlight all around Ah come on, credit due for setting the wall up correct and positioning himself well. Many get it wrong Brother there’s a reason goalies have a height requirement, you don’t want zola in goal now do you? It’s a clean save. he missed a load of chances Was so pissed at Dubravka A bit controversial, but he ain’t afraid to say what he thinks! Shut your mouth, ungrateful bastard Sad but kinda true, dude will always be haaland's shadow until he stays in machester city, should probably go to barca,madrid or some other top club Why is this downvoted? It's true, Alvarez will be benched when Haaland's back. And that is why he should leave your team I honestly think he took a bit of a gamble here and guessed it was going over the wall. That’s why his save was so comfortable It looks cool in slo-mo It looks cool. Honestly a save you’d expect a keeper of dubravka quality and size to make all day. He also got a really strong punch on it, it went all the way over to the sideline far from any danger. It's not a spectacular reaction save or anything like that but in terms of goalkeeping fundamentals he got every single thing spot on. Let Alvarez have a rest lad ""I think we should play the guy with 329283532 goals last season and the main guy since forever"" - Ungrateful pigs not letting the guy with 1 season here play over them! Ungrateful?   I love Alvarez but he will be on the bench when KDB and Haaland are both back.  Jeez wind your neck in What’s with the hostility? They won a treble that way. It’s not like they’re gonna change it any time soon. Pep starts de Bruyne and Haaland over him when they’re both fit because Alvarez can’t provide the goal scoring Haaland does nor the playmaking that De Bruyne does. So starting both of them is just logical Argentina players dont know u lil bro I'd give Dubravka more credit and say that Alvarez telegraphed where it was young with his body positioning just prior to shooting and Dubravka moved quickly, making it seem comfy He started all 3 of them in the first game of the season it's not that crazy Yeah I know against Burnley, but it’s still not his preferred lineup typically, and especially not in big games. That game he put Foden on the left which we almost never do as we have grealish and or doku down the left for big games. With them back, the where to play Alvarez becomes significantly trickier, because you’d have to bench Foden, who’s been on better form than Alvarez and is better centrally. So Alvarez not starting makes sense, even though he could also start fine. But at the end of the day man city is the best team in the world so people need to stop taking it personally if their favorite player isn’t a guaranteed starter"

Rocket of a shot from Julian  Set up by a crisp Enzo tackle Puro sexo ese gol (Great goal) DISCULPA Que manera de sacarse el demonio de encima Unstoppable. This is possibly the best game I’ve seen Argentina play in a while. Reminds me of the first half of the WC Final. Unbelievable performance and all without Messi!

Video doesn't load for me con la chota zurda que ni el sabia que tenia The Argentine Ben Simmons Stop, I'm getting nostalgic 😭 I know it’s hard to compare eras because the game evolves, but how would you say the Argentina team of the past few years compares to one from Maradonna’s glory days? Could this be the best NT ever? Fr that was an absolute rocket Homie looks surprised. His reaction was like ""Holy shit, that worked?"" Absolutely unreal, easily our best performance since the WC Final. We won the Copa this year but we were a bit shaky, this was just pure dick-in-your-ass domination. Has Messi been holding Argentina back this whole time? Happy cake day El Demonio de Calchin se desato Flaco nos expulsaron a santi lopez y loyola jugo como el culo vs argentina, estamos condenados, deberías estas llorando lanus Best goal I’ve seen in a while no joke I was not born early enough to see that team, LOL  But I do think this current team is our best team. It's certainly the best multi-year string of results ever—the only real comparison is right after WW2 when Argentina won 3 straight Copa Americas, and I don't think that really counts in the same way My dad has seen our 3 World Cup winning teams and thinks the current one is our best, followed by the 1978 team. He doesn't think too highly of Bilardo (our coach in 1986) and his defensive tactics although it was a good team. Does help that Chile are absolutely well and truly finished. Thanks for the answer. From an outsider’s perspective, it seems like they are. I think if they make a run of semis or better at the next WC, it’ll become pretty indisputable. I can second this, my dad also saw all 3 teams and says this one's the best You can never discount the motivational hate Chile has, and Gareca is a great coach. Even with their golden generation they pretty much never won the actual match against you, the 2 finals were won on pens. Its not a surprise the finished version of Chile would go to Argentina and get rolled over. I’d say the hate is just a general hate all South America has for Argentina at this point 😂   And Gareca done nothing with this team, they’ve played 4 official games with him and have had the a shot on target…maybe 3 times in those games? We are truly terrible.  That said, not taking anything away from Argentina. They showed off exactly what a different level they’re at rn. We chill with Peru and most of our northern brothers"

Is their project just to buy all the young prospects and sell them for more? Getting more than 40m back for Omorodion will be hard considering Spanish clubs are all broke. Why do Chelsea need Samu if they have Jackson and could end up with Osimhen too?  Edit: completely forgot Guiu too Chelsea just want unlimited strikers, goalkeepers and Brazilian teenagers I think at this point it is becoming increasingly clear that the Chelsea strategy for success is to simply buy anyone and everyone they can until they are the only club physically capable of fielding 11 players in a match. City will be fine with Oscar Bobb Hahahahaha Atleti are stupid if they sell Samu for 40m, at least ask for 60m Don't think Osimhen will go on loan. Maybe if it's obligation to buy.  Plus he is on massive wages and Chelsea doesn't want to pay those. We’re actually getting both lol. Think I’d prefer Samu staying Atleti bruh the fact that chelsea could end this window with osimhen and omorodion lol.. Chelsea's entire transfer policy hinges on the fact that one of the several hundred players that they buy turns out to be a gem that they sell for an exorbitant amount to cover up the losses on other players. What fans essentially don't realise is this constant buying and selling of players will not translate well on the pitch. While Clearlake may book their profits eventually, fans will have to settle for mediocrity. Simeone has been very reluctant to selling Samu thru out this window which means he has him in his plans but lets wait and see but I think it would be difficult to getting Samu signing over the line as Simeone might be a bit unwilling on that one I feel nothing now, it was slightly interesting when they first bought us, now it’s just insane. Sapped the life out of me when it comes to silly season (not that actual season gets much better). Depressing. Don't know what we're going to do with 12 strikers, but okay.  Don't know how we're going to pay Osimhen... but if we do, and we offload LeKaka, then I guess we do.  But Guiu looks like the real deal - why do we need another 9 prospect? Now that’s a cool transfer At what point do Chelsea start selling managers and coaching staff? Bruv I’m tired. When does the window end? Makes sense for all parties  Unreal player and I’m sure he’ll excel at Atletico Chelsea really are just Todd Boehly's Football Manager save come to life. What is Chelsea actually trying to do here? And the fact that their current project has failed till now means no one is looking at it critically like 115 FCs. A dude currently benched by Abel Ruiz costs 40m ok chelsea whatever if it eases Julian coming to la liga go ahead. Atletico bought Omorodion for 5m and are going to flip him for 40m as Atletico buy a better player. They’re doing the Clearlake model better than Clearlake. As petty as it sounds a i feel [justified](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/cpSrWMwPl7)  Always held on to him being at city was a [waste](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/8z4WXY6adI) Love us or hate us  You all still watch us Which comes first, the transfer ban or the points deduction I don’t even know how to react anymore. Just feel grim with every passing headline Yep lol 😂 tbf I don’t see osimhen happening because we want a loan and he wants a permanent transfer One hour of no Chelsea transfer news is all I ask. Is that too hard? We desperately need a two year transfer ban in order to save the club from the idiots running it to the ground. No it’s perfectly normal!!!  Every club wants to be us!!!  They’re just jealous!!!  If you can’t see what we’re doing then you’re just a hater!!!  Paid for by BlueCo, a subsidiary of Clearlake Capital. Fuck Boehly ball We know Absolutely. If you look past the potential implications, it's actually ridiculously entertaining. Been that way for the past 3 years now I mean if I had to try and find some logic   Chelsea will either sign one of them and are keeping their eggs in both baskets  Sterling will move to RW Chukwuemeka is sold Palmer moves inside Jackson moves to LW Who would have thought that the Bohley era would make the Abramovich era seem calm and organized.  I miss the days when our biggest problems were players harassing Americans post 9/11, a cheating scandal between England teammates, a racism scandal between England teammates, a stadium rebuild stuck in constant purgatory, nazi fans, a full transfer ban, or our owner being sanctioned as part of an ongoing war and being forced to sell the club. At this rate even a Chelsea fan is gonna have trouble with that. I already felt that way about them this last season or so with Disasi, Badiashile, Jackson, Madueke, Ugochukwu, Chukwuemeka, Gusto, etc lining up Same That's the main goal of the project, yes. Genuinely just think of the project as an fm save, just applying the logic to real life. Will it work? No idea, so far it hasn't, but we'll see in a few years when/if (because its not a guarantee) all these dudes develop and get kept, or sold for a profit also I don't like to talk about players like this, but assets depreciate Yes, I think it's really starting to look like this. The people that run Chelsea now see it primarily as an organization which buys and sells players, as opposed to an actual football club. >Is their project just to buy all the young prospects and sell them for more?  Yes I mean if you sign 60 prospects and 15 reach their potential you'll have a world class team, then sell a fraction of the rest + whoever is disgruntled and wants to leave and you'll have your money back  Edit: I'm probably giving them too much credit but that's what it would seem they're doing No one knows what it means, but it's provocative it gets the people going. Chelsea doesn't understand Chelsea. Or we could just use him or even sell him to non-Spanish clubs. Not sure why the options should be limited to selling back to ""broke"" clubs. > I do not understand Chelsea at all. Is their project just to buy all the young prospects and sell them for more?  Basically! They've been pretty explicit about using Chelsea as a means to make money on player transfers. With their current model they'll probably just sell Jackson on next season. Hasn't damaged his value, no place in the squad, profit, repeat >Edit: completely forgot Guiu too  Just like Chelsea. Jackson would probably play on the left wing if they both ended up coming Samu is better than both  Edit: Obviously not better than Osinhen lol, but Guiu and Jacksom You could maybe make an exception for strikers as you could play 2 or 3 at a push, but I don’t think anybody has a clue what’s going on with the keepers Genuinely baffled how they see other similar players going for more (or worse players go for similar) to and from PL clubs and when they get the chance to negotiate with a PL club, they sell for a discount. 60 mil for a guy who scored 9 goals last year? But Alvarez for 75 is too tough? I smell some accounting bs between Atlético and Chelsea Sounds like they really want Alvarez and we have them a slight discount compared to prem teams for Gallagher Chelsea would be more stupid to pay anything above 15 mil for Samu, he's crap. Sets up next window where they sign two strikers starting with the letter P. So what, they're going to sell Cole Palmer for 130M? That won't help them get into the CL again. Surely the stance is changing because they are trying to get Alvarez. Sounds like they might need to sell to fund the Alvarez deal and you take a proven Alvarez over an unproven Samu every single time Well one is 24 with years of first team experience while the other just began his senior career. Not hard to understand. He scored 19 goals last season for City (3rd behind Haaland and Foden) which is a really solid return. No one with any brains would view that as a ""waste."" Insolvency Tbh I wish Todd Boehly still had a say in football operations. It’s all Eghbali and the SDs now > Sterling will move to RW Chukwuemeka is sold Palmer moves inside Jackson moves to LW  None of those makes any sense...  - Sterling shouldn't have a place in the squad anymore  - Chukwuemeka is actually one of your few promising players from last season when he played early in the season and gives you an 8/10 type of player in the squad that you don't really have  - Jackson is a striker, not a LW, all the skills he has that make him potentially special as a striker are not as impactful when he plays on the wing Already have Ugochukwo -  Chukwumeka. What the duck is going on here? Will you lot even be able to play all of these players enough for their value to increase? not all assets always depreciate. I imagine Cole Palmer's value is higher now than it was this time last year. Honestly, I agree, don't really think that this model works outside of clubs with development oriented reputation (Benfica, BVB, Brighton). You'll use him for a couple seasons then jeffinho or someone from Santos will pop up and Omorodion will be forced out. Jackson is good at LW. This might be last chance for mudryk and madueke though. But you have Sterling and Mudryk there No he's fucking NOT!! 😂 Jackson absolutely clears him Samu isn't even better than Datro Fofana, he's crap. Petro doesn’t have great distribution and Kepa, well, what else is there left to say. Might as well go for Alvarez lol. Would be better than anything Chelsea have. Sounds like some FFP shenanigans Yeah he’s way too good to be wasted on the bench. > Tbh I wish Todd Boehly still had a say in football operations  Why? That initial Boehly window was a disaster I don’t think Maresca rates Chukwuemeka. He played the first two preseason friendlies and was pretty atrocious, and hasn’t gotten a single minute since, even Tyrique George (18 yo from the academy) was coming on at CAM before him. Reckon Carney is most likely earmarked for a loan or sale, but maybe not since he can play at CAM and be depth. We’ll see Most of things this ownership does, doesn’t make sense so the other guy must be on to something. Agree about Chukwuemeka but you're far off on the other two. Sterling is maddeningly inconsistent but still one of our better players. And his wages mean that like it or not he'll have a place in the squad. Jackson originally played at LW and looked excellent there for us in the few games Poch had him there. Sterling most definitely does lol   He’s undoubtedly our best LW option   Whether that should be the case is a whole different matter.   The gap between him and Mudryk is colossal-it’s like the difference between Salah and Shaqiri. And even then that’s harsh on big Shaq. Ugochukwumeka Who knows. Can't see it happening personally for them all, and think we'll have to try flip some early, like Datro Fofana and Casedei for example, meaning either small gains or small losses How many games did we need to play Hutchinson for for his value to increase? Or Maatsen? Or Hall? A decent number of these players won't even see the first team and still will turn a decent profit. yes of course, Cole Palmer's value is higher, but if you buy 6 Cole Palmer's one will inevitably succeed  however in no way is that sustainable Palmer is the massive success he'd be 100+ of course. Has any other player really increased their value? Enzo caicedo lavia disasi sterling all dropped fairly considerably. Madueke maybe (can't remember how much you bought him for). Jackson is probably worth a bit more. Nice, one out of the 500 players you’ve bought over the past 2 seasons has increased in value. Absolutely cole palmer's value is higher now but imo if you sold him for 100m you would still end up with a much worse squad if you keep doing what you are doing now If you say so. There is nothing wrong with always striving to improve 🤷 Nobody will want Mudryk, at least not a profit. I think you could make a few mil on Jackson. And profit has to be your main game soon So where does Nkunku play? Shite they are, rather have Jackson there than them. So let’s assume these transfers go through. What does their XI look like? Last season he was the best performing under 21 striker in top seven European Leagues for pretty much all the key metrics  You are clueless Dumbass We are trying to sign a penalty box striker it would seem. We want a striker who is dominant in the air it would seem Very different profiles I mean we have wanted Samu for nearly 2 months now not like it is new interest Lol he was the most used player by apps alone, and in the top 10 for minutes. He just wants a bigger role which he won’t get at City from under Haaland’s shadow - but that is far from being wasted on the bench. At least we were signing adults 😭 The grass is always greener. I think he picked up a small injury and that's why he hasn't featured, he's unfortunately very injury prone Didn't you pay 20m for him? Would go down as a loss on PSR which your owners are obsessed about What about Nkunku at LW?   I guess this is a different point considering I completely disagree with what Maresca is doing.  To me, given the personnel of the team and their strengths, Nkunku and Palmer should be inside forwards with support from overlapping fullbacks and the expensive trio of midfield transfers in Lavia, Enzo, and Caicedo should be more of a flat midfield tasked with controlling the middle. Those are youth products and not expensive signings right? You see the difference? I didn't say that wasn't the case. You spoke as if all assets always go down in value which simply isn't true. Gusto as well, then players like Santos & Angelo likely have as well. Granted it not a high hit rate but it's not limited to just a couple that have improved. Players like Enzo and Caicedo at their transfer fees aren't a surprise, they're long term players that need a broader look at their impact beyond a season.   Where it's hurting Chelsea the most is the mid level transfers, dumb ones like Sanchez, Ugochukwu, Disasi.    Tbh in general I don't think looking at such a short period is of much value to anyone anyway, no doubt its not going well but judging these transfers after a year or so of turbulence when its more likely the value in another 2-4 years is what actually matters. I'm sure more saw their value go down than up, but I was merely responding to a post that simply said ""assets depreciate"" as a matter of fact.  If a young player's value is going down, it's because we likely overpaid (which is very possible here too) and/or the player is not performing, not because ""assets depreciate"". There are millions of players in various clubs whose value rise.  I'm genuinely baffled by how people defend that brainless statement.  > also I don't like to talk about players like this, but assets depreciate  Nowhere did they specify Chelsea. The increase in value for a small proportion of players signed could potentially outweigh the losses from depreciation of the value of the majority of other signings  Plus Palmer isn’t the only player we’ve signed whose stock has risen. I’d argue Gusto, Madueke, Jackson, Carney and Datro Fofana are worth more than when we signed them. We’ve already made £20m off Hutchinson. I mean if he turns out to be Palmer level good he'll stay, same if you get a transfer ban. We won’t make any money off Mudryk for sure. 62 million + add ons seemed ridiculous at the time but now people know it’s daylight robbery. Will be interesting what happens with him, since there’s been reports Jackson could be used off the left if we get another striker, and honestly he’s better than Mudryk in that position for now. Which is disappointing to say but it’s true Medical room. Sterling-Osimhen-Palmer KDH-Caicedo-Nkunku Cucurella-Colwill-Tosin-James    Or something to that effect, you could also easily slide in Jackson, Noni, Enzo, Gusto, etc. Our fanbase has a large amount of idiots don’t concern yourself with what he has to say Also in context of your above comment, i'm not sure how selling a player for less than they could have got elsewhere is helpful re: FFP. For he’s calibar is pretty wasteful when he only gets an oppertunity when either kdb or Haaland are injured, since he essentially have to bank on either of them being injured.  Of course he played a lot minutes when kdb was injured until January or February with the only replacement being Alvarez and Foden. And then eventually Haaland got injured for some period. Why would any player want to bank on their teammates always getting injured to have any form of meaningful minutes. And then obviously he doesn't get to start in the most important games. When Haaland and Kdb are available. And eventually foden wil take Kdb place. So Alvarez would always be the second in the Striker position or even a position that isn't he's natural. Hack sometimes he even plays right wing.  So yeah it is wasteful when a player barely plays he's natural position all season.  Edit: just checked and he played as Striker in 22 games out of 54. How's that not wasteful for someones development? Yea Sterling was such a better purchase than Palmer, go grown ups! Maybe, but if that was the case why keep him on the bench? Others who had small knocks didn’t feature until they were ready like Dewsbury Hall. And if he really got injured after friendlies then it’s time to move on anyway because the guy can’t stay fit for 3 games in a row Sorry id missed this. He’s been here two years and so I think it would be around 15m and above to make a profit on him for PSR purposes. Just depends if someone would want to pay that, I reckon they’d move him on for an offer in that range (was linked to Milan). Maybe even a loan to try to bump his value but he just can’t stay fit So the problem is the lack of width then. Ideally that’s my fav choice and then one of the fullbacks provides width but that’s not gonna be happening  I think Nkunku will actually be effective wherever he ends up playing.   He can do LW but he’s a shadow striker. As long as he isn’t tasked with sticking out wide it’s fine They didn't go for peanuts, even if we'd bought Maatsen or Hall for £20m we'd have made a healthy profit. And <£20m is the region we're talking about for these loan army players we've bought. Obviously... In no way did they say all assets depreciate lol In the meantime, the club becomes a mediocre club. Quickly becoming the next Southampton! Chelsea have spent 1.3 billion under Boehly. How will the appreciation of a small proportion of players cover that? Gusto, Palmer and Jackson are the only ones I'd say have increased. And of that list, only Palmer has increased substantially.  Gusto was bought for 30mln euros. If he leaves today, he's not going for more than 40mln euros.  Jackson was bought for 37mln euros. Maybe he can get to 50mln euros but not much more.  Madueke: 35mln euros. Value about the same.  Carney: 18mln euros... Value about the same. If higher, only slightly.  Fofana: 12mln euros... Value maybe 20mln euros    Now want me to talk about all the players that have fallen drastically in value?  Mudryk: 70mln euros so far... Max value is about 40mln euros... He alone has wiped out all non Palmer gains   W Fofana: 80mln euros... Max value about 40mln euros  Enzo F: 121mln euros... Max value about 85mln euros  Caicedo: 116mln euros... Max value about 85mln euros  Don't forget the likes of Sterling, Disasi, Badiashile, Cucurella etc that have also dropped in value.  The reality is we overpay on unproven talent for the most part... It's a risky bet that's more likely than not to fail Well, the 2nd option isn't happening... I still don't see Jackson as a left winger, definitely not in the style Maresca wants to use. He's more of a wide forward if anything, never been convinced by the left wing shouts. Who is your starting keeper for the season? Thats.. really not a great lineup considering the money spent.  Colwill tosin sounds like a disaster cb pairing waiting to happen. Colwill has potential but was meh last season and tosin is bang average. Nkunky is also not a midfielder hes at his best begind the striker. Then you add a washed up sterling and a mediocre GK on top of that.  Never in football history has a team spent so much for so little. The 2021 cl winning squad looks better than this.. Gusto is quality, the issue would be left back. > but assets depreciate  That means all assets depreciate. Or at the very least, most assets depreciate.  Didn't you have logic in high school? in which case, the statement ""also I don't like to talk about players like this, but assets depreciate"" provides zero value which is what I'm getting at. Saying ""assets depreciate"" is a general statement about nature of players as assets, and that's false. Why don’t you subtract the money recouped from sales and reduction in wage bill? I wouldn’t dispute your current valuations.   But there is surely so much more room for these players to develop and increase value further.   We laugh about the stupid long contracts but when all these guys do reach that peak age they will still have so many years left on their deals to maintain that value.   Of course it’s a risky project but people don’t consider the much bigger picture I don’t particularly see him as a LW long term, but I do think he has the attributes to succeed there, as he’s a good dribbler, has a strong body and his link up play is good. Honestly though, I think it’s more just that I feel so down on Mudryk, who just seems to never improve significantly. I do think moving Jackson away from ST is a shame tho, since he’s so good at link up play through the middle which helps drag us up the pitch, and he’s brilliant at turning CBs. Hard to tell, Sanchez and Jörgensen are competing. Osihmen with Nkunku behind him and Sterling and Palmer on the wings with Enzo and Caicedo at DM is very strong.   James is great but we all know his situation. Gusto is a great number 2 nonetheless. If Cucurella can bring that euro form to Chelsea that’s left back sorted. Colwill is great but they need an elite seasoned CB to partner him. They aren’t far away from building a very strong side tbf Gusto is great yea but chilly is made of cheese  And there aren’t too many quality lbs  Cucu is great when he can invert but he does have clear weaknesses It means in general which is closer to most than all. And in this case, most of our assets have depreciated.. So he's spot on. But it's only because we bought them overpriced. I don't think most footballer assets depreciate until they get past a certain age. Ok sales of around 350-400m. That still leaves you with close to 1 billion in spend to cover.  Chelsea had the second highest wage bill in 22/23 and a wage to revenue ratio of 80% in 22/23. Even if both figures have improved, it's still too much considering the lack of Europe and the spending. It's tough for players to appreciate though if they're only sitting on the bench or getting loaned out. It's what we've done for years with our academy players and that model worked for Abramovich. The dfference though is we didn't buy those players for expensive prices. Now, we're paying much for them instead of 0.  Boehly and co are trying to rely on the law of large numbers. You sign many and some with succeed. The ones that do should more than compensate for the many that don't. It's the VC & PE model. The only problem here is the starting point. If the players bought were around Giui's price point, then fine. Understood. But when you're spending stupid money (over 1.3bln spent), it makes it much more unlikely for the project to succeed. I think those qualities are more suited to a winger in a direct, transitional team rather than a possession-based one. I'd keep Jackson down the middle.  Mudryk has been a huge disappointment, just never seems to kick on.. What about Kepa or Petrovic? Never seen a team in the GK you guys are in.  3 or 4 quality keepers yet none of them are really Champions League quality. Pretty crazy considering that Maatsen was right there, but I guess you couldn't turn down the money, especially since it's pure profit ^TM >It means in general which is closer to most than all  So basically what I wrote.  And nowhere in the comment did they specify Chelsea. Just because your club has been doing a shit job doesn't mean assets depreciate. That's when our squad was ridiculously inflated, and we had a lot of high earning players. Those figures should have significantly come down, and there's still plenty of players we plan on getting rid of I still think it’s much to early into this project to mark it a success or failure.   None of the prospects we’ve signed have reached their peak form or value so it’s pointless trying to decide now if it’s worked or not.   I know it’s not saying much but our performances and results have gradually improved from the appalling start we had. We’ve also not had as many high cost dud transfers either.   We’ve just signed a stupid number of apparently mediocre players. If the scouts and directors are as good as hoped then we’ve stockpiled the next generation of top footballers on the relative cheap.   The £1b isn’t going to be made back in just one or two seasons Yeah agree on that actually. Especially as we are seeing Maresca expects the wingers to hold the width and that would be a waste of Jackson’s skill set. Mudryk is such a strange one because he shows flashes of great vision or like there’s something there, but it’s once every 4 games and that’s just not good enough and it just isn’t improving. > What about Kepa or Petrovic?  Kepa wants to leave and will be sold this window, possibly released even. His time here is over. Petrovic is good but he isn't excellent, and his passing is a weakness. So he's getting sold also. You interpreted it as ""all"" and I said it's closer to ""most"". You literally copied where I said that and still wrote ""basically what I wrote"". Well then There is also a need in the short-term for Chelsea to get CL football for the extra money it provides. I think there is a very good chance that doesn't happen with the current squad, in which scenario the 1b hole in the finances is really going to bite. > That means all assets depreciate. Or at the very least, most assets depreciate.  > basically  Reading is hard. The current squad is easily the 4th best in the league, imho, and if we had a competent coach last season, we probably would've achieved CL football We were only a six point swing off of Villa.   Competent coach sure but we forget Lavia, Nkunku and James missing for 90% of minutes."

It's Bolivia but our front 3 are doing wonders Nah Messi this is absurd 😂  He's just one assist away from having the most assists in international football history Fuck’s sake we actually don’t deserve to be routed like this this time 😭 Damn Messi is on fire this game. Looks like he’s trying harder than he usually does at Miami or maybe is just feeling 100% healthy now A generous God. Another assist for the GOAT. What a game. A healthy Messi is still the best in the world TBH Great assist but what a unique way to shoot in that position Scaloni really needs to start this attacking trio from now on. VAMOS CARAJOOOOOOO  La araña que pica Con permiso 💅🏻 That assist made me ejaculate Messi 2026 babyyyy Big 3 showing out tonight Gonna cum The goat… the assist… Never retire pls Script writers need to find new ideas. Welcome baaaaack que tridente señores Hat trick of G/As in the first half for him ffs Assisting merchant wtf assist was that? wtaf! god damn! what a fucking ball that was. wow. what’s up with Leo today, he’s out for blood Football is too easy for THE GOAT it seems     what a trick Get bro out of mls 😭😭🙏🙏🙏  At least he’s having fun As a Brazilian I wish I was watching this game in Argentina live Messi doesn't want to be owed by his teammates Messi, what a pass, what a front three Gotta be brave and admit it, I just came Replay: [https://streamin.one/v/e0b15878](https://streamin.one/v/e0b15878) They can thank me! ^^/s I was gonna go but decided against it to not see them lose again. Have seen them play 5 times over the past 15 years, always with Messi, all loses, 0 goals :( I reallly envy the people who watch Messi even back in his prime time imagine being a real madrid fan and watching Messi there or any English fan... That would be a lifetime experience tbh. Boliva who defeated Colombia 1-0 not too long ago. But in their stadium obviously. They're really vibing tonight. Hot damn, surprised to see Donovan topping that list. Wasn't expecting that. Incoming... What's the record and by whomst've? Agreed, you are quite decent. But the lapses in concentrations is costing your dearly. First goal the defender triped, in the second you just cannot leave Messi free like that, and in this one the fb could have done much better imo It's two things: Bolivia not being 0-6 bad, and Argentina being 6-0 good. Bolivia is mostly paying for unfortunate mistakes, as well as a gap in quality with Argentina, but Bolivia is actually a cracking team. Even losing, they play out of the back and seem like a cohesive unit. If they can get more quality in the final third they'll keep turning heads. Having elite-level teammates and being fully healthy makes the biggest difference tbh I’d say both The only difference is that now he only looks 1 level above the rest of the team (same team that's been the best in the world for 5 years) instead of looking like 5 levels above the rest.  Edit: nevermind. He still looks 5 levels above the rest of the team. Absolutely. No better player to be on the field wearing your shirt than him. He is the best at everything. The Ozil way This works against Bolivia beautifully but against a team that can and will attack it's trickier. I actually don't think it was the attacking trio that was the highlight from yesterday. Yes they performed but all by the grace of Messi. Lautaro and Julian both scored on a Messi assist (Julian's finish had more merit with his elite first touch). I think the real revelation was a great showing from the supporting cast. Nico Paz was amazing, Thiago Almada was great, Palacios had a decent showing, Otamendi keeps scoring (unfortunate offside call on Tagliafico) and most importantly, La Scaloneta is a well-oiled fighting machine. Truly, we are so blessed to be witnessing this team. It's a gift and it won't last forever. Enjoy it while you can. They need to put you on house arrest during home matches Being mufa must suck dont go to the 2026 world cup or there will be consequences You need to attend a sequence to break the bad luck. Save up enough to see all their home games in a year or all the home games in qualifiers. Eventually a draw or a win will come about and you'll realize and laugh that you just had really unfortunate luck for a period of time. In El Alto TBF Before this game the stats were  1. Landon Donovan 58 assists in 157 games  2. Neymar 57 assists in 126 games  3. Lionel Messi 55 assists in 188 games Spot on. yeah I wonder how much more he has to decline to be just an average world class player lol If it was on purpose it's a filthy finish, hard to tell though No worries, I have done it myself :D Yeah, would like to enjoy a game once, but definitely never going again lol I wouldn’t think to spend that much money to see us lose, no worries on that haha Yeah El Alto is just a different ball game, I have no idea how anyone can play football at that altitude. Definitely wasn't expecting Donovan Neymar is so underrated, top max goal scorer for Brasil and 2nd max assister. Had he being injury free , more disciplined and not leave Barca, he would have achieved so much more. He is still one of the Brazil greatest players without the World Cup. Taking one for the team, I respect you lol Ask Bolivia...lol Lots of mate."

I love the up-and-down doom and gloom from Atletico fans this summer Was this before his medicals? So this is going to be bit awkward once he goes back to City tomorrow. Lmao I like his manners and the way he carries himself Damn. The Madrid derby will be lit What was that signature? surprise ending, follow his heroe demichelis he sign with manchestercity again It pains Why is he wearing two watches? lol Tier F for fans. [deleted] Should be official tomorrow. Alvarez, Gallagher and Omorodion deals are all connected so will probably be announced at the same time. Gallagher already completed his medical and signed his contract a few days ago hola mate he only paraphed it the jersey has a contract on it It has been a truly schizophrenic window. From losing out on Dovbyk to Roma to Alvarez picking us over PSG. From not a single signing being announced in late July to Le Normand, Sørloth, Alvarez(anulo mufa) and Gallagher in a short space of time Even if it happened how awkward really is it? Everyone has acknowledged he’d like to go there to be a star player and has said nothing bad about City. It was a win/win transfer for every party so not exactly a walk of shame back to City if it fell through, just unfortunate all round. https://x.com/MatteMoretto/status/1822755651858374953  >The entourage of Julián Álvarez and Conor Gallagher are confident that their moves will not be affected. Have you learned a lesson now about not being gullible and swallowing every new rumour that comes up? That would make me so happy. So so happy. Happy New Year seems like he has a really good family and support system Madrid time and Argentinian time duh yeah sure 1. No you didn’t  1. If you actually did (which you didn’t), you might want to see a doctor. That is pretty concerning and could be a sign of serious medical conditions !RemindMe 1 year  (How many goals has Haaland scored in important games? Setting a reminder for one year from now.) Why do you have to say this Ohhhhh dear. You sure jinxed that lol. >Alvarez picking us over PSG.  Not that hard tho Praying oh god please tell me I am already asleep and this is just a nightmare I mean that was the situation, all deals were confirmed by both Romano and Moretto don't think you can blame me on that one. Let's see what happens with Samu, but surely Atleti won't let Alvarez go now Did I?  Don't be so reactionary and overreact to every new rumour It is hard.  You have to let go part of generational wealth, that can change the course of your family and future, just because you want to follow your own passion, more than family and future.  Do you see the burden? Your passion vs. Your family's comfort and safety over the years. Choose. Yo you guys have a Atletico reddit account? I couldn't find one ! I’m messing with you.  Goodnight going to cry myself to sleep this motherfucker thinks atleti will be paying him minimal wage lmao Yeah Atletico the working class club pays minimum wage. Atletico being poor narrative has to stop  They are 3rd highest earners in Spain and at worst top 20 in the world. Simeone is literally the highest paid coach in entire europe. Julian Alvarez will be fine dont worry Yes it is true, where will future generations find wealth from the poverty club of atleti r/atletico Feeling better now? ""minimum wage and no healthcare or go to France, your choice"", yeah, even easier choice It’s not that they’re poor, it’s that PSG have shown they’re willing to spend so much more money than everyone else. And with PSG you get all the perks of ‘sponsorships’ they can barelly afford food Yes thank you, still sad if Gallagher doesn’t sign but I guess that means Guerra could"

I can't remember the last time a free-kick of ours went in holy shit I missed this feeling Man, that Julio Alvarez is good! Wonder why I haven't heard of him before. Announcer called him julio Alvarez 😭 Como te quiero Araña, vamos joderrrrrrrrr sometimes all a man needs to smile is: It looks like Mia Khalifa le saco toda la mala leche Golazo he’s pulling out old tricks There he goes Pero que jugador tenemos, madre mía. First, damn! The Sparta goalie legit got frozen in the goal line unable to do anything to stop the freekick.   Second, I'm surprised this game doesn't have a match thread unlike the Milan one going on at the moment. Argentinian masterclass 🕷️ I swear theres more freekick goals than usual atm. Love it I love how he knew he converted it before it crossed the line as he was already running to celebrate. great skill there by the Atletico fan celebrating without spilling the beer Underrated miss at City rn The wall and the keeper both on the same side was asking for trouble. pew pew pew Vamos Juli Totally forget he went to Atletico. How’s he doing? I know Messi is still active, but I would like for Julian to take more FKs for Argentina as well. Not knowing for sure who is going to take a FK and it being a right footer and a left footer is a great asset. I put $50 on correct score on 0-1 and another $50 on 1-1. Since Atleti gonna sit deep and not score any other goal, I think I won haha Isn't griezman decent at them? You are telling me he wasnt your main FK taker already? He was the best FK taker in Man City IMO, even better than KDB except when the FK is far from the box as KDB gets more power than Julian in those situtations [deleted] Griezmann's season opener You might have heard of his cousing Julian Alvarez who played for River Plate, Manchester City, is a two times Copa America champion and also a World Cup Winner. He absolutely did. All match too. El multiverso es real y no estamos en el principal Tomó la posta de la chaqueña he's only gonna grow >Second, I'm surprised this game doesn't have a match thread unlike the Milan one going on at the moment.  No Americans on the pitch in this one that's why I don't think they miss him  Where would he fit in the team? He's not better than Haaland and he's not good playing in midfield. Started slowly but looking better and better. 10 goals in all competitions F lmao sit deep? is it 2015? 😭 He only scored like 7 freekick goals in his career for Atleti, but he is very good at set pieces in general in terms of crossing 2 goals from set pieces in La Liga this year. 12th in the league. I wish we did, we barely score from corners compared to our golden years We have been dominating the whole first half from open play. 64% possession, 12 shots to three Opened your mouth a bit too early 🤡 Lmao Missed the game the would explain why I don't remember, I probably saw the highlights but man it's hard to remember another one Libertadores winner as well, playing & winning the most important libertadores final in history. No importa, estamos en el multiverso donde ganamos el último mundial, estamos en el universo correcto He was a direct player. Something that City miss. If Haaland doesn't score or Gvardiol, they don't score at all. He gave energy in places where it was needed. with all of that he's completed football meanwhile hes gone and city can't stop losing Braindead take...oh an arsenal fan, no wonder... Championship team Atletico Madrid playing well away from home, my eyes must be deceiving me. Yeah, before that, the only free kick goal I could think of is Suarez's against Cádiz, which was like three years ago. I just don't think he fits in the team, he's not better than Haaland up front and he was mediocre when he played in midfield, also had a few nightmarish performances like at Anfield. Correlation does not imply causation, I don't think he would help their current situation. Where would he play? I couldn't believe what I was seeing lmao Long may it continue, we need to three-way title fight like the golden years of la liga."

Na KDB is too good Grealish hair De Bruyne built different 😤 LET HIM HAVE A HAT TRICK FOR HIS BIRTHDAY >:( Who was Pep celebrating with? I'm guessing he came up with that set piece KDB turned EPL into a farmer’s league again… So sexy , MY GOATTTT KDB = still back Beautiful set piece Julian having Netherlands last goal in the world cup flashbacks how can you hate de bruyne when he plays football this way. so good Helluva birthday present That pass is ridiculous... The pace on it to get Alvarez in behind and the way it slowed for him to hit it...  KDB is just absolutely ridiculous Training ground special Having KDB is cheat code That is so clever YOU BETTER STOP KEV That's a fabulous goal -- what a great set piece. KDB is too damn good.. really tidy finish too. They need to nerf KDB 😂😂 De bruyne got the prem quaking on their boots holy fuck burnley are getting caught so off guard De Bruyne, stop it Kdb gives off Thanos vibes i love julian more than most relatives of mine Unreal ball from Kev there I see, the Weghorst special 🥶🥶🥶🥶 Who needs haaland anyway Our set piece coach is ass, can’t defend anything, can’t create anything from them. Even our throw ins take forever It’s going to be one of those games [Great assist] It was a great pass , but Alvarez had a critical finishing there too.   Great goal [deleted] Jesus christ, Burnley. bday boy's gonna bag four They're going to win 12 in a row again, aren't they. KDB is a different animal As usual in this sub, nobody knowledge Alvarez for the goal. Quick thinking indeed..what a player! just curious what does two hands up in the air means and one hand? does it mean something or just be ready? Facking hell, changed my FPL cap from Alvarez to Foden last minute  End me City averging over 3 goals a game since haaland been out.  Tut tut tut. Poor defence play again from Burnley. Man City cruising away and probably want more This will be the 45th City/Burnley game in a row that ends 5-0. Opta are foaming at the mouths to point this out at FT. We jerking off KDB for some of the worse defending I’ve seen? [deleted] Juli hat trick incoming? Birthday goal nice FPL team owners crying Fuck me that’s brilliant Beautiful Mirror: https://streamin.one/v/6810464b [deleted] Perfect example of an inch perfect pass he probably spent the week analysing Burnley's positioning on free kicks, must feel amazing to see your plan come to fruition. I wonder what it’s like to have that ability to just put the ball wherever the fuck you want, must be crazy. Set piece was great, but the quality behind that pass is absolutely insane Basically a cheat code by now [deleted] Burnley tactics are absolutely horrific to allow this to happen lol. Na that defending is amateur Birthday hat trick :D Yep. His name is Carlos Vicens -- City's set piece coach. Judging by the effort put into the defending, I'm going to guess Kompany Haaland coming up soon too. It's like being punched by mike Tyson while you wait to face Mohammed Ali Does anyone hate kdb? Birthday hat-trick incoming. Who’s? What's it called when you play a game without using the cheat codes? But please don't actually 🙏 Have they even dropped points since Haalands injury? Real litmus test, Burnley at home. different animal, but the same beast In the prem city had 2,4 goals per game with Haaland and 2.3 without including this game Who do you want him to play for Pretty sure Vinny’s are entirely dust i had that ability when i was younger, weirdly enough i only wanted to put it through the window of the hospital behind the pitch Must be so mundane for him though, like ""put the ball there? ok whatever... easy enough."" Must be frustrating for him too that everyone else can't get on his level What does Europium KDB have over Salt KDB An average Sunday league squad would be fuming at conceding this hahaha. Absolutely horrific defending/set-piece coaching. It's both. Great pass but any decent defense should've been able to stop that Battrick Teams have a set piece coach!??? some do, at least from what i've seen on social media Why stop at a hat trick? La Arana Citeh-ing …duh 😂😂 [deleted] Burnley at home + managed by Kompany who thinks he's managing prime Barca what the fuck does that mean Kobe Bryant Same, dad's shed window got it three times Sodium kdb They hate what he does to their club's lol Nah they play with them on Also this would be city’s 8th straight win in all comps That'll teach it My idiotic school had the goal post in front of the administrative building.

A south American would never allow that lol Walker with 2 assists Where are the commentators seeing handball on that? sloppy by Walker that, great run originally though dont worry guys i know brighton has this Ederson hockey assist. Come on at least let us win the GD battle at least  I worry they'll catch up even on GD by next week lol Guys 4-0 is the most dangerous lead right? 4-4 any time now I just want Julián to have nice things. Good to see him perform well. Pure suicide by Brighton That ginger lad is having a stinker Premier league teams try to not make it easy for City to win the title challenge (dark souls difficulty) we’re never beating the mf allegations 😭😭😭😭 Vamos Juli  What a pass from Ederson tho Brighton are terrible, lmao HAHAHA the chants at the ref 😭😭 Wow that defence is unbelievable. Roberto De Zerbi stock has fallen rapidly this season Wait isn’t that hand ball from walker? How is this a goal? Walker kicked the goalkeeper's hands before touching the ball. Hand ball? Ref come on that is shocking You can see how much this goal meant to him , after a constant streak of being benched , despite showing superb performances and doing midfielders  role very well when Kevin was injured. This lad should have changed team long time ago. He is not a player who should be benched 70% of league games [deleted] Clear foul Some of the worst goals I’ve ever seen in my life Prem teams rolling over for city is a fucking joke.  **AA**  [REPLAY](https://footyload.com/aaza/) Chelsea was the hangover. They didn’t take advantage Their loss against Madrid in 2022 was even more heartbroken, then the game after they destroyed Newcastle 5-0. I feel like City has gotten their UCL win and broke their curse. UCL exits from now on won’t hurt them much as it did when they never won it same thing happened years ago when we crashed out hard against Madrid, people thought it would demotivate the team only for us to go on and batter wolves 4-0 at the Molineux This is Madrid's fault, they've awoken something here... It's okay never believed in Brighton anyway  Who they got next? One sec  Ah Forest  Yes yes NOW I BELIEVE IN YOU FOREST I KNOW YOU GOT THIS   CHRIS WOOD  ELANGA  GIBBS WHITE   RISE MY SONS Unfair to have a keeper with that precision and the fastest right back alive in the same team. Brazils so lucky to have him and Alison Game's gone. Shithousery needs to be part of the gk curriculum Cross assist, rare as hell Almost unbelievable I can't recall the last time he had 2 assists in a match. Wouldn't be surprised if it was his first 2 assist match for City. Crossing has always been one of his biggest weaknesses. Spun off of Walker maybe as he went to win it off the keeper Give ederson the hockey assist He was too focused on passing it that he almost took too long to do anything lol He didn’t know what to do with all that space They have them where they want now. City walked right into their trap The comeback is imminent. Any minute now Oh they absolutely can. City at the end of the season are GD monsters, check out 21/22 for what I’m talking about  City on 1 game a week… they’ll be dropping 6 a game Wrong Manchester team. Been done dirty by De Zerbi, only played 1 min since arriving in January and then gets a first start vs City He's 19 and starting his first Premier League game at LB against a pissed off Man City.      I genuinely feel bad for him, his manager put him in a position to fail. Been decent going forward tbf I mean he's slightly exposed. [deleted] Nope I don't think they can chalk it off unless it's the goalscorer himself Support arm Hes got 30 starts in the league, where are you getting 70% from lmao He was destroyed by Pep. He's not the same Alvarez who won the WC. This shitty team wasted his huge potential.   But as he won every tournament possible, he's enjoying a comfy life in England, so I have no right to judge his choices. But I wish he would leave this team. Oh dear. Poor you Got the ball first lol Luckily they all count the same your club could use any goals atm Almost as if we’re better than almost every team in the world Played like they were genuinely hungover against Chelsea. Stones was throwing up on the pitch and got taken off at halftime. the most devastating loss for me was against Tottenham in the UCL tbh us being knocked out recently wasn't that deflating of a loss  Like obviously it sucks but going out by penalties is the least upsetting way to go out It was actually 5-0 against Newcastle. The 5-1 win at Molineux came after that. Unnecessary outcome bias, they finish like this they beat Madrid easy. Forest will never be allowed to score again after the statement. We're going to have to support Spurs for a game aren't we? Could be worse. You could be rooting for Spurs Tavares is getting 5 year contract extension after that game Goalkeeper -> RB -> ST -> Goal Its kind of a waste. You can only play one keeper  Also they are about the same age so they wont be able to take over for the other. Not really, you only need 1 good keeper since major International tournaments are so short.  I'm sure they'd swap one of them for a World Class midfielder or forward if they could The most dangerous lead 5-4 let’s go! Any time now! Also they were supposed to be playing with a back 3 to cover for him by now, I'm still confused about what happened there. Barco is also class, a 3 that could easily play as a skilled winger or number 10. If he played for City everyone would be praising him but alas, here we are The 3rd goal is not even his fault too. Baleba snd especially De Zerbi share the fault too. He never was the best on defense though, thats why he exploded once Almirón started playing him more as a LW than a LB. He's basically in the TAA mold, much better in attack than in defense. Played as a winger for the scum a fair bit  De Zerbi even said he wouldn't play all year only to throw him to the wolves here His ass. Out of his ass obviously 2 penalties not given to Brighton and imaginary free kick for your second goal. Please try to deny it Doesn't really matter though, it's reckless and endangers the keeper He goes in two-footed into the keeper's face... Tbf we did play 120 minutes 2 nights before It’s between those two definitely. I’d put it Madrid loss at 1 because of the way we absolutely collapsed from a commanding position. Either one can be argued tho Yep....literally went out to a tie breaker but atleast it wasn't a collapse like previous years. Also helps that it was penalties loss to real fucking madrid And literally because of a change of rule technicality.     If away goals still exist, everything would be different i've completely misremembered the molineux game then, i thought it was 4-0 all from kdb If only Madrid played as open as Brighton The same can be said for us, and that's not counting the very many dangerous transitions we created that we didn't take a shot off.  Someone up above is saying that if the away goals rule was still there, they would have through easily (*'we only went out because of a change of rule technicality'*, to quote them).   Obviously, if everything that could go right for City went right and everything that could go wrong for us went wrong, City would beat us easily.   Perhaps someone will now jump in by saying if only had jumped on Silva's penalty as is expected, they would have gone through. Forest OG incoming If we somehow win all four games  And then Spurs beats City somehow?  God  That would be the funniest way to win it 😁   But tbh I'd rather City lose every game starting Sunday Keepers never get injured? Interesting Put Eddy out there 🤓🤓🤓 arent their forward roster super duper stacked? I think they might even be playing 4-4-2 but Igor followed his man crazy far into midfield. Also Barco could have had a good head start and he would still have lost that race with Walker. >If he played for City   He already does, they just insist on calling him ""Sergi Gomez"" for some reason I know how he is, been scouting for a bit when he was linked.   Definitely shouldn't be playing LB. Left midfield would be his best position.  Still didn't expect him to be this bad defensively, he's making Walker look like Prime Cafu. > De Zerbi even said he wouldn't play all year only to throw him to the wolves here  Guess that's what happens when all our other LB options are injured or playing other positions because of injuries.   He's not even had a particularly bad game, has actually made some things happen going forward and other defenders have had more issues. I deny it. There you go! Ok Goalie himself didn't complain what you on about For me it's the Liverpool tie.  It's the final year before VAR, the opening goal is offside and we don't get a penalty on Sterling in the second half. Then in the second leg we batter Liverpool like I've never seen before or since really, except when they were down to ten men in the 5-0. Score early, then pin them back for a whole half, hitting the post. Just before halftime, Milner plays the ball back to Sane who taps it in. The ref gives offside which is completely wrong. And then our heads go and Liverpool wrap it up.  We were relentless that season and got fucked over by refs (and a classic Pep brainfart of playing Gundogan on the right wing at Anfield). I think we win the CL if we go through that tie, certainly put up a better showing against Madrid than Liverpool did with Karius Man, if only Kev scored that 2nd goal in the 2nd half. I'm glad uefa scrap that rule benefits us more than ever because team not park the bus all the time Madrid gets lucky a lot. And I mean a lot literally *""The only trophy you lot won was for us!!""* It's much less common than other players. what it's true, why would you need two good keepers, they rarely get hurt I like the team right now but it has been said that this is the worst Brazil team in years It's the power of Madrid make other teams miss sitters [removed] At some point it's not ""luck"" anymore. Bet Real Madrid thought the same Because, when one does get hurt, which is more common than you believe, you don't want to be fucked without a decent keeper. Hell, both Allison and Ederson have had injuries this season. Probably not because of the forwards though no? I remember some stinky attackers from Brazil NT in 2014-2020, Neymar the big miss*** but the rest seem really good Definitely, the margins were so close which is why I don’t think the ucl exit is really that big a deal mentally for City It’s kind of a self-sustaining myth now. Everyone says Madrid gets “lucky” saves, “lucky” goals but they ultimately have an excellent team. One mistake against Vini and he’s through, give a little room to Modric/Benz/Rodrygo and Madrid scores, one wrong step and Rudiger in on your ass, if your shot is even barely saveable than Lunin/Thibaut will save them, or the defenders will block them. So players will try to take the complicated maneuver, will attempt the most finest angle to hit the ball, will always try to be above and beyond at their finishing….and that would lead to missed shots, fumbled plays or worse, Madrid saves/blocks your attempts. The more the game goes on, the harder it seems to score against them because they buy into the believe that their time will come soon, and you start to believe in the black magic. Did I say they never get hurt? Did I ask you if it was less common for keepers to get injured than other players? Didn’t think so You’re such a little nerd you were ignoring an important fact Okay old man fucc ur pussy"

Probably one of the best thing ever to happen to his career. The amount of players who seemingly dislike Van Gaal is quite a long list, he must be difficult 😂 We could have had a midfield of Toni Kroos and Thiago Alcantara. Excuse me:  https://media1.tenor.com/m/ijSgAYN6HxUAAAAC/indignation-jump.gif Imagine the opinion on Kroos if he joined our cluster fuck of a club. ""United only need to buy a defensive midlaner to unlock Kroos!"" Fergie was not just the coach but he was playing multiple roles at the club including the modern day sporting/football director. We didn't have a structure after him and this began the era of signing players for a manager only for them to be irrelevant for the next manager's playing style And so began the era of mangers signing a load of players only for the next manager to immediately get rid of them >Then they hired Van Gaal and we both politely declined  Kroos always sounded like a prudent man. He's got that life decisions thing down I can understand Kroos declining. But, why would Van Gaal reject Kroos? I will never forget the Van Gaal comedy start in one of his seasons at United - 3 shots on target for the first 5 games. Dreadful football. I dont know how the mancs attendance didnt drop with 50%, the most boring football I have watched in my life and I have seen a lot. Am I misreading the headline, or is no one else curious -- why was David Moyes sitting on Kroos' sofa in Munich? lucky boy In hindsight, this makes Manchester United signing Louis Van Gaal one of the worst decisions in PL history. What could have been… So the day Moyes got sacked, he was at Kroos’ house? God what a mistake that would've been for him if he did sign for United As a Barca fan who lived through Van Gaals second stint, I completely understand Toni. The man was an absolute pos that made me hate watching the team back then Somehow he would have been the most mid player ever if he did ""Moyesie is the key to all of this"" - Toni Kroos Poor Kroos had to break the news of his sacking to him. Lol van gaal really is marmite isn’t he Moyes was sacked in April, why was he at Kroos's house in the middle of the season outside the transfer window? So funny that he brought his wife along [removed] Was absolutely gutted we didn’t bring him in, but Moyes’ biggest issue was believing he’d have the whole 6 years of his contract to assess and build his squad. He still needed to keep winning, or at the very least maintain a challenge.   He spent all the previous summer chasing Fabregas and then got Fellaini for an inflated price on deadline day. everyone could see if he didn’t bring in a CM or two in January he wouldn’t survive the season, but he brought in another number 10 (Mata). I’ve always believed that standing still with Moyes for a season set us back a good few years, and we’ve been playing catch up ever since, without a plan.   It seems we have a plan now, but I don’t think we’ve got the right manager. Un bb Probably would've left for another club 25m for Kroos at that time was such a steal. I would've loved him at Arsenal but there was no way he would sign for us given the state we were in at the time. Is this not widely known news? It wasn’t even that long….  Nvm I’m just old United failed to save us from the evil that was Kroos in Madrid In Spain, even 25 years later, we still remember the famous ""siempre negativo, nunca positivo"" press conference when he shouted to a journalist:  You are so mean. The interpretation ... ALWAYS NEGATIVE. ALWAYS NEGATIVE. NEVER POSITIVE!  His accent sounded kinda funny when angry tbh. Van Gaal might be one of the most overrated managers of all time. We could have potentially had Kroos and Pogba together in the middle.   Fucking Glazers Yanited’s “almost” starting XI would dominate Europe. I don't understand. Why *both*? He said they sacked Moyes and contacted Van Gaal and at that point **they both** declined. Who is the other person that declined? I refuse to believe that he would’ve chosen Moyes United when Real Madrid came calling. He might’ve been ok to join initially but afterwards the deal would’ve fallen through. They were sniffing round Simeone once to replace Fergie as well. Thank fuck that didnt happen, much hilarity ensued instead. He's talked a lot of crap since he retired. Same with Lewanowski not going to Blackburn. And one of the worst thing happened to us man utd fans Super late reply but Kross lets say have a bad experience with LVG due to him being there 2009-2011.   Never counted on young Toni and never appreciated his vision and skills until Jupp Heynckes came to the picture And to Madrid too Hey the positive side: instead you guys got a terrific Angel Di Maria and his charming wife! Also Probably one of worst things ever to happen in Moyes' career.   Instead of having Kroos orchestrate the midfield he got Fellaini elbowing everyone The way he talks is outright repulsive. At least when he talks in German. In Germany his nickname is ""Tulip General"". His attitude and way of speaking is very militaristic and the tulip part is just because he is Dutch.   I‘m not sure if there is a single person out there who likes talking to Van Gaal when he is your superior. He must be the child of a drill sergeant and and an extremely arrogant dutch aristocrat or something, his whole demeanour is so out of touch. to be fair there's also a similar amount of players who do speak very highly of him. Rooney called him the best manager he's ever had, the whole Bayern 2013 CL winning generation also still revere him esp Schweinsteiger and Müller I think the issue is he’s very rigid and won a lot over the years so he never felt the need to adapt or change anything he was doing. Creative players largely disliked playing for him because they were forced to follow his instructions or get dropped. There are always exceptions but he is a somewhat polarizing figure.  On the other hand Rooney loves him There’s no inbetween with Van Gaal.    You either loved him or you hated him. I think part of it might be a sense of decency. Here is the man, talking to about why Manchester United is the best place for you. He's come to meet you, face to face, and is talking to you about your future, and how important you'll be for his and the clubs.  And while that's happening, while he's talking to you, you both find out he's sacked. That's got to be a really hard place to be. Suddenly having to be the person helping absolve someone's difficult moment. ""Sorry about your job mate. Hearing while you're out here in Munich instead of a meeting with a person, that's really harsh. But yeah, naw, I'm definitely going to go work there. Sounds like a caring place.""  (I don't know why I just made Kroos Australian. Bear with me.)  That might not have been the end of it, and LVG might have been a reason for him to say no. But you can be sure that situation didn't improve it. He makes Hitler look chilled. What makes you think he dislikes van Gaal? I mean, if a guy like Leo Messi doesn't like him, he must be really bad. You can find the distaste from players towards him even in the 90s. Stoichkov from the 90s Barca Cruyff dreamteam hated the guts out of him, after he succeeded Cruyff as a head coach. Van Gaal is a great coach and POS human. Fate intervened, so we could watch Modric and Kroos on the same team. Don't forget Mourinho got a chance to sign Fabinho but went for a 29 years old matic instead Damn Let's be real, you would have ruined them both Wouldn't have made any difference, how many amazing players had their careers ended by going to United? The whole mindset of just ""buy good player and get win"" is why United is such a graveyard. Bayern could have had the same as well. Best part is they would complement each others play styles extremely well And Fabinho.  Don’t forget Mourinho rejected the opportunity to get him because he knew Matic closer Whats the big deal man you got McTominay and Fred instead It’s crazy to think that decision is difference between Kroos being one of the best player of a generation to not (had he joined United). Well I hear Madrid is loaning this rather unknown defensive midfielder that goes by Casemiro. Maybe you lads should give it a go! United brought that defensive midfielder who unlocked Kroos tho 🤣 I think that United could’ve had the RM midfield trio and they would have still not won the league Don't worry, before bagging ETH you had an interim manager who was the master of the gegenpress who was going to create a system for all upcoming managers and sign players for that system.   United fans exclaimed that this time it was different because they had a long term plan. Fergie didn't have a style as such. He was more like ""this is who I have, ok then lets see what we have to do to win"".  The few times he tried to impose a system, the two Barca finals, CR7 first couple of years, bad. Not much has changed then. Still considering sacking Ten Hag after bringing half of Ajax to Utd. During Fergie’s time, almost all managers in England were also the Director of Football.  Spurs were one of the first english sides to hire a DoF in 1998 and they were widely mocked for it.  It was seen as undermining the authority of the manager.  Even a big club like Liverpool didn’t hire one until 2016 - way after Fergie.      Fergie was the best of his generation though.  There was never going to be any replacing him. Thankfully we moved on and didn't buy every one of ETH targets. Oh wait ... I mean, he's claiming he was ready to sign for Moyes' United, so it's not an unblemished record. ""politely declined"" probably more like ""fucking hell no"" *""Toni Kroos,* *~~smiling~~* *declining politely""* They both worked together at Bayern, I'd assume they had a falling out during that time Wasn't there also countless 0-0 at HT? I Presume it was for negotiating and discussing the project? I understand this happens quite often after the buying club takes the permission of the selling club to meet with the player in person. Would have been awkward for moyes when he found out he was sacked if that’s what happened lol Yeah everyone wants to analyse “what could have been” and no one seems to care about this bizarre headline that makes almost no sense. ... And if Moyes was sacked, what was it he was declining?  Or is ""we both"" referring to Kroos and someone other than Moyes? he played the most boring fucking football too, if you’re going to be an asshole at least make your tactics exciting Replacing SAF with Moyes was a bigger blunder. That’s how I understood it lol He is a footballing genius *I'm sorry David, neither of us will be at Manchester United this season* Hmm call me crazy but I dont think Tony Kroos alone would have changed Utd's fate to the point of winning league titles and champions leagues More likely they would have ruined Kroos's career. guessing this is satire because people thought this about plenty of their other signings back then only for them all to fail miserably I think clearing out all the coaching staff Fergie had too was a mistake, I think he’s said that too. He wanted to make his own mark and fair enough - but I think if he’d come from a trophy winning team that probably would work be more justifiable.  But respectfully at Everton he hadn’t been in that scenario, and hanging on to some of the team that helped the (arguably) one of or the greatest manager of all time for some, and knew the club, players, culture could have been a difference maker But Kroos literally just said it, you would've had a young, generational midfielder if you just waited.   United needed a rebuild but everyone thought they were above it for too long. Moyes knew, his successors knew, the squad wasn't good enough. But he was one of a handful actually doing something about it. > Then they hired Van Gaal and we both politely declined.  It's literally in the same sentence my dude. Van Gaal It’s okay, he can still back it up on the pitch if he wanted to. Blackburn also decided against signing Zidane in the 90s, with the reasoning 'why sign this zidane bloke when we already have Tim Sherwood' OB from Denmark was interested in him but thought he was too expensive at 400.000 euros in 2007. Few months later Lech Poznan bought him.  I think 400K is his weekly salary now at Barcelona haha He'd have made it big regardless.  You know what's mental? Blackburn Rovers almost signed Zidane as well.  There was some scout at Blackburn pulling his hair out after he told them to sign Zidane and the manager said it was a waste of money because they already had Tim Sherwood (an actual quote). Dortmund set off that Volcano and you can't convince me otherwise We nearly signed Zlatan way back. Knowing us we would've ruined his whole career. With Lewandowski I genuinely wonder if Klopp's career would have taken off without him as well. He had a patchy record with forwards apart from Lewandowski at Dortmund. And as great as he was - he wouldn't have gone to Liverpool if he hadn't won those 2 League Titles with Dortmund. Holup Not at all. He'd probably have moved on again to bigger things, but we wouldn't have damaged his career. We were still a well run club at that point.  Same with Ronaldinho not going to St Mirren. If not for that volcano Bale staying at Spurs and not coming to us was also a big factor in his rise, sadly for us! Modric put a transfer request in at Tottenham to go to Chelsea. Went to Madrid a year later after Levy wouldn't sell to a rival.   From a personal perspective it's gutting but for him it was the best thing that ever happened to him.   Suarez wanting to go to Arsenal is another He was also literally at Fulham/Motspur about to go on loan there I think summer 2010? Yeah but we got Schneiderlin, everyone on r/Reddevils assured me he was world class I genuinely don't think it would have made that much of a difference for United. They have signed lots of players who at the time have been extremely highly rated. Pogba, Di Maria, Sanchez, Ronaldo (does he count?), Zlatan, Mata, Varane, Bruno, Casemiro. All really established top players at the time. Then you also have the likes of Kagawa, Mkhitaryan, Martial, Depay, Lukaku, Shaw, Sancho etc. who were all very highly rated when they arrived. None of them have really been able to have a huge impact on the club's success. I have a feeling Kroos wouldn't have become the player he is today if he went there.  Some of these players were past their prime, and some were bought for their potential, whereas Kroos was just entering his prime. I still feel like United really hasn't been the place to go in the last decade or so. Things have just been off no matter what big names they sign. not really, the past decade couldn't have been unfucked by one or two signings, god knows we've had plenty of those (with nothing to show for it.) In one of the FM’s i preferered his bro, felix kroos I think that to a large degree it is related to the combo of not having the biggest natural talent for languages yet his insistence on speaking the local language wherever he manages. That by itself is not a bad thing at all but it leads to some...complications.  When he speaks dutch, his choice of words and tone can also be annoyed, but unless he gets angry the style is more akin to a strict school teacher than outright rude hostility. He is just able to put much more nuance in his dutch which kinda evens out the rough edges of his communication style, and he can't do that in any other language. I love LvG but yeah, he can be weird as fuck.   Gomez told this crazy story on a podcast: when they both first saw each other, they said hello and shock hands. Except that LvG never let go and kept staring into Gomez' eyes like a madman.   After an agonizingly long time he finally said: ""In the Netherlands we don't just say hello. We introduce ourselves by our names!"" Idk if you’ve seen his/our 2014 WC run, but all these players were running through a wall for him. Sneijder got fit (as in not overweight) for the first time in 3 years, Kuyt played right back for a game, van Persie and Robben jumped on him whilst hugging.  I also believe Muller still loves him. His father died when Louis was only 11 and he and his 8(!) siblings were raised by a single mother. His education and upbringing were characterised by a sense of duty and discipline. Plenty of players absolutely love him though. But he's not everyone's cup of tea lol. Iirc he used to be a gym teacher in high school? If I remember correctly Cruyff said the same thing about Van Gaal, how he is too militaristic in the way how he managed his team, [source](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/12/johan-cruyff-louis-van-gaal-manchester-united) A lot of people in the Netherlands like this style (not me). It is insane at times the things that get shoved under the rug under the banner of, atleast he is clear/direct. If you ignore all the good stories about a coach, while only acknowledging players that hate him or have bad stories, then obviously it’s easy to paint someone as hateable His players either love him or hate him. If you can get 23 players to die on the pitch for you, it's worth making some enemies along the way Must be pretty crazy coming from a German His own daughters call him 'Sir, and not even in affectionate ironic way MIA SAN MIA. UND ICH BIN ICH. That's not necessarily a bad thing for a coach. But some players cannot deal with it. Those who can, gain more with such a coach than with ""normal"" coaches Well, he was a school teacher before he became a football manager. He got his mannerisms from being a teacher. I thought you guys liked orders from generals and those enjoying the speech on the square München only solidified that thought > the whole Bayern 2013 CL winning generation also still revere him  Not Kroos, though, or so it would seem Slightly pedantic but Rooney called LVG the best *coach* he ever had and specifically talked about his tactical skills and very fine attention to detail. I can definitely buy the idea that LVG was a better tactical coach and more focused on little details than SAF, but I’m sure every united player from the 2000s and early 2010s (apart from Roy Keane, who hates him apparently) would say SAF was the best manager they had >Rooney called him the best manager he's ever had  Damn, even though the dude played for years under SAF? I wonder what the story is there. Oh for sure, like anything in life people will have their opinions and will either like something or not. I was just commenting because I find it funny that Van Gaal seems to rub quite a lot of people the wrong way haha The last sentence lol United were actually linked to Modric too when Sir Alex was the manager. Honestly think Thiago and Kroos would be a stronger pairing as long as Thiago remained healthy Thought that was us messing about with the asking price and then Liverpool just went in and paid it. You also could’ve signed Cody Cody Gakpo Still better than Chelsea signing Bakayoko over Fabinho. I remember at the time of the transfer people were saying Fabinho was the better one. Mourinho had Fabinho for over a year when he was at Madrid and did nothing And Chelsea used the Matic money to sign Kante that very same season.  Not jealous about that transfer window in the slightest. prime messi couldve have gone to manchester united and theyd still find new records to break they played together for a year and didn't complement each other  they were each others competition/replacement Why do we assume he wouldn't have been successful? The great ones tend to be good regardless of the team around them In fairness, that should have been the plan. From that point Ragnick and his successor should have played the same way United didn't listen to Ragnick's suggestions, though. He wanted to gutter the roster. The players are not at the level of where the club should be. If you look at the lineup, not many players have left. He is the biggest fraud and still has the reddit fans convinced he did a good job SAF style was winning at all costs. It was disgusting.  There were at least a couple years towards the end where he legit had one of the worst top 4 or even 5 starting 11s but still won the league or came second. wonder who’s next! I do think the players we have now can play a very good system together, they're all relatively young and energetic, and can press like hell when they want to. We just need the right manager to get the best out of them, and maybe EtH is not him. I think that has changed in the sense we'll likely not hire someone who wants to immediately Martinez, Ugarte, Onana, Hojlund, etc. Look, Moyes might not have been the best fit for united, from a sport perspective, but at least he sounds like a decent guy, and by that i mean he's probably not keen to show anyone his wrinkly old man balls...unlike LVG This was when MU was still one of the top clubs in the world prestige wise and it was still viewed as a desirable club to go to. Moyes was also still rated very highly and as an up and coming talent in coaching from his time at Everton and being handpicked by SAF no less.   In 2014 MU's bad form under Moyes was seen as just a blip and they were expected to bounce back to be at the top almost immediately. No one could have predicted they would still be struggling to be the top dogs till this day I think Moyes would have made him a more central figure of the team going forward and the face of the rebuild that was a couple of years overdue.  Van Gaal probably would have had some strict requirements  Moyes had a great run at Everton. If Kroos and Pogba had been at United together, who knows what may have happened. Who didnt Van Gaal have a falling out with at bayern? I may be misremembering but i believe that Van Gaal was the reason why Kroos went on loan to Leverkusen. So funny to imagine. I’m picturing Kroos brining out a tea to David as it pops up on sky sports news that he’s been sacked. genuinely one of the most boring games of my life watching Utd 0-0 PSV Eindhoven at OT. at the very least i could usually just enjoy being in the stadium but not that game. dreadful Van Gaal ball. fucking freezing wind blowing to top it all off I love that people still believe those were his intended tactics. At Bayern it was offense all the time, but then at United he was finally able to fulfill his dream of boring defensive tactics. Or maybe the team was just shit. And no van Gaal didn't help with his scouting, but that's not his strong suit as we've seen at Bayern. Letting Moyes dismantle the setup was the issue. United’s problem even now is not having enough midfielders who can pass the freaking ball and rarely loses it. It drives me absolutely crazy that no one talks about this when it’s been a problem for 11 years. Think Pogba and Kroos would have been sick, Kroos could also play a bit defensively ( you know the ""unlock"" pogba with DM thingy ) It depends who was the next manager. Tbf no one they signed during the 2010’s come close to Kroos. He would’ve been their best signing. Yeah but what confused me was that it looked like two people declined on two different signings,  while it actually is both people declining the same signing Ok, so *they both declined signing Kroos*.  VG: I don't want you here.  K: I didn't want to be there anyway Captained them to a league title tbf Where’s the lie? Funny thing is  that was  also l Legia’s reasoning against signing Lewandowski. Why would we sign him we already have Arruabarrena Always nice to see OB around The same story is going around with him being ""close to"" signing for a 2nd or 3rd division Norwegian club. Rumour being that him and another polish player would do a trial with them if they would pay the travel expenses... Which they politely declined as that just wasn't a thing lower league Norwegian clubs did/could afford. Yeah, he would have been a legend at Ewood Park, right up there with Morten Gamst Pederson and David Dunn. He could have been Blackburn's 2nd best ever striker Wasn't the manager, it was Jack Walker the owner >pulling his hair out  Is that how one becomes a bald fraud? I think it’s impossible to ruin Zlatan. That internal drive cannot be ruined. He’d probably want to leave Sunderland after a year though. Klopp already won the league with Lucas Barrios as their starting striker in 10/11. I remember Dortmund fans treating Lewandowski as a joke figure back then. >he wouldn't have gone to Liverpool if he hadn't won those 2 League Titles with Dortmund.  Yeah.. he won one of those titles with Lucas Barrios as a striker who scored 39 in 83 games for Dortmund. Alexander frei scored 34 in 74 before that. it would've, since klopp had already won the title the season before lewandowski started scoring for fun We won the title already before Lewandowski had his breakthough What are you talking about that team was all Shinji and the midfield Life is a bunch of happenstances.   Its why we shouldnt pat ourselves to much on the back if we do well,  or be to angry with ourselves when life didnt happen as we expected. Well Lewa helped by improving himself, but Klopp won the league without him,, and he credits Klopp for his development. Yeah Suarez and Modric both got lucky there, went down as legends at Madrid and Barca. We were in for Schneiderlin as well, and gotta say he was a fit for our post-Bale transfer activity. Take the implications you will from that. Damn, completely forgot about him. He retired last summer, probably without anyone noticing Never forget the confirmation of his transfer via blood test results. I was solidly sure he was going to be a nice player, kind of ended up an exotic foreign Danny Drinkwater didn't he 90% of that list were past it or riddled with injuries. The other 10% had attitude issues/clashed with the manager.  Utd's problem since Fergie is they don't buy players the manager wants and don't have any plan for the style of play/players. outsider looking in, what the hell is united's problem anyway? how did you guys fell off? Read Miro Klose's biography. Crazy stuff how LvG treated him and he went out of his way to terrorize Luca Toni ""Then why don't you introduce yourself by your fucking name you weirdo."" ""You can't press the button if I keep shaking your hands.... MUHAHAHAHAHA"" We all really enjoy people who use their culture to explain nightmarish awkwardness. In what culture is clutching people okay? He is really divisive, some players absolutely love him, other despise him. Kuyt would play any position, he always gave everything for his team I think Schweinstiger still has a good opinion of him from his time at United too Sneijder also admitted afterwards that he didn’t like him and that players usually had to laugh about his huge ego and act Well, another factor for those players in particular that it would very likely be their last World Cup. I think they would've gone through hell to win it regardless.  That Spain game just gave them such a mental boost that it probably wouldn't have mattered which manager they performed under. Even the Dutch the players from the Dutch team he coached last world cup and In the last euros have also told how much of a father figure he was for them both professionally and personally. I mean, Sneijder also didn't really like van Gaal and van Gaal almost left him out before the WC, but Sneijder did turn a page mentally because he wanted to be there.     Also a lot of the current squad doesn't like van Gaal which is why we got de Boer when Koeman left first time instead of directly getting van Gaal [deleted] [deleted] That is sad. He's still a dick. And a very devout Catholic upbringing Such things can change entire trajectory of your personality early on. Not impossible Van Gaal would be a different person if his father didnt die early in his live People can't grasp that, when you work in football for 30+ years you make plenty of enemies. Ribery doesn’t either  “We had problems on a human level. When he started, nobody knew what was going to happen. His idea was that he did not care about names at all, you don’t need stars, everybody had to prove themselves again.  The first contact with him was already poisoned. As a professional you lose your trust. He does great things on the pitch. But the coach Van Gaal was a bad man. Our relationship was crushed.”  Aschually he technically didn’t play in the final stage of that season Keane rates Fergie. He hates him because he saw him as a father figure and felt very betrayed by his dismissal. There is quite a long list of players who had a falling out with SAF. Let's not act like he was some sort of saint or something. just a side note, but on Beckham's Netflix series, he only mentions SAF per name one time. all the other times it was ""the coach"", ""the manager"" or some sort of mention. gave me the impression they had a fallout (well, there was the boot incident) and never really got along too well. I agree, shallow and pedantic I believe Rooney was speaking about tactics wise, LVG was the best. Didn't SAF also have a difficult personality, despite his ability as a manager? Some players just seem to click with some managers and others don't. Benitez was also known as not being a people person, but players like Torres and Gerrard spoke highly of him. Didn’t Rooney and SAF have a deterioration in relation towards the end of his tenure? IIRC Rooney handed in a transfer request in 2010/11 and signing RvP after Kagawa seemed like a sign that he wanted to move Rooney on despite his achievements That doesnt really scream dislike to me but aitt Wasn't he closer to Chelsea but the owner didn't want him to go to a rival to they sold him to real for fairly cheap? United also linked to haaland when ole was at the wheel We've been linked to every good Spurs player at some point. How does one even believe in something like this. Lol Good one Modric is possibly the best midfielder of the last 10 years, it's between him, Iniesta and KdB. It was like a year before he moved to Liverpool. He wanted the move but we were never interested in him  >[“My objective is to get to a club with the dimension of Manchester United – I have no clue if one day I’ll be a United player, but I’ll keep on working so it stops being a rumour and becomes reality,” ](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/fourfourtwo-meets-monacos-main-men-my-objective-get-a-club-man-united-i-dont-know-if-it)    >[""Manchester United is a great team and I would think about it,"" Fabinho said. ""If \[Manchester United manager Jose\] Mourinho invites me it would be very tempting,"" he told Brazilian television channel Esporte Interativo.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40384251)  So ye we could have had a midfield of thiago, fabinho and toni kroos >Cody Cody Gakpo  Could've been the next Eric Djemba Djemba Tbf we had Rashford and Sancho back then and Garnacho was on the verge of breaking through, a LW is the last thing we need. > You also could’ve signed Cody Cody Gakpo  And miss out on Antony? And Julian Alvarez Kante join the season before and matic play with him to help chelsea won the league. The money was used to buy bakayoko lol Agree to that, in hindsight it‘s easy to say that letting Kroos leave was a mistake, but Thiago, Müller and Götze were extremely promising too.  But I remember one game against Hertha, where they played with Lahm as a six and Thiago and Kroos as eights. Three of the most consistent and accurate passers there were at the time.  They had like 70% posession, and all of them at least 96% pass rates, one of the most dominant matches I‘ve ever seen. They didn't have the hindsight of seeing how Modric-Kroos went. If someone believed in pairing them consistently, it might have been different. Because who has been successful at manU over the past decade? The list isn’t very long, it hasn’t been a conducive environment for players to thrive in. I want to agree but more and more I find myself wondering if opportunity and environment isn't a bigger factor than we often want to accept. It's easy to imagine Robertson going on as a solid player and maybe even a bit of a hero at hull or going to a lower half premier league team and having a good career but not becoming arguably the best left back in the world.   He's a different type of player than kroos, technical skill wise but maybe even pogba you can imagine going to a different club and actually becoming one of the best midfielders of his generation too. And if Southgate coached Liverpool for some reason we'd never know how good Trent is.    I wonder how many players out there could be something different with a different career trajectory. I think some agents help their players realize this and others maybe chase money more.    But it to me it all shows both the importance of good scouting to find these types of people, of good environment and club culture to get the best out of them, and also some amount of chance to who we consider the best.  He probably would be. But players are also judged by trophies as well as impact they make. More likely Man Utd would still be the same team today. The whole point of that plan was to stick with a system and base recruitment on that system. While having someone who knows it well in a consultant role helping the manager.   Then they immediately let the new manager sack him off and sign whatever players he wanted for a system that was his own.   Like it was a half decent plan...it had logic, then they immediately abandoned it to go back into the same cycle they were apparently trying to break out of. Yeah...and can anyone say he was wrong?   Last 3 finishes have been 6/3/8, it's only 5 games in but they have had a bad start sitting in mid table.   United should be a super club, it's the third biggest club in the world but in football terms they are about on par with Tottenham. > If you look at the lineup, not many players have left.  Pogba, Matic, Lingard, Mata, Cavani literally left the following summer. Even earlier, 2000/2001 his was about the fourth best team iun England. He went somethiung like 3-5-1 win loss draw record againts Arsenal, Liverpool and Leeds.  Still won the league in a fucking canter. He prioritized winning against everyone else and betti g the others would (and did) slip up. Ole 2.0. When ETH position becomes untenable, appoint RvN and let the fan favourite legend have it till the end of 't season. Didnt he threaten to slap a reporter i think Moyes should have gotten more time honestly.  He was clearly struggling to settle into the new more rarefied surroundings but he might have adapted and had more confidence to make his decisions. Robben I guess Müller spielt immer Lol no, Kroos was on loan already when LvG joined Awkward silence while Kroos and Moyes look at each other. The 2016 Sheffield United FA Cup game (93rd minute penalty winner) was the worst I've ever seen us play live. No one was moving off the ball, it was just passing and shadowing practice. Bruno loses the ball constantly but he is untouchable at United. That's why they ""can't play 3 in the midfield "" ever, it means playing him deeper.  But yeah they've lacked that type of midfielder for a long time. You better be having another DM in there you only say that because of what he achieved since at real madrid.   di maria, falcao, pogba, sanchez even martial were all excellent signings on paper. >Morten Gamst Pederson   What a player. David Dunn is blue and white,  Blue and white,  Blue and white,  David Dunn is blue and white,  He hates Burnley Damien Duff And Tugay David Bentley > And Tugay. He didn’t score that many but most of them were bangers. every single time I read a British football legend's name I cant tell if its completely made up or not Bug Chris Sutton fan? Surely shaving it off would be more fraudulent? He'd want to leave Sunderland the second he got into the city It was really weird because Barrios was playing well for them the season before but Lewandowski just started scoring and never stopped. Yeah, Lewandowski was a meme for a bit until he suddenly started banging them in against everybody and didn't stop. He was playing often as a AM in his first season because of Barrios Lewandowski had to play off position on the wing because of Barrios. Luckily the next season went incredibly for him. alex frei was also very good About that: Lucas Barrios scored 16 goals in 10/11 when Klopp won his first title. We were in for him as well! Thought he'd be exactly what we were crying out for then, I remember being quite disappointed when we missed out on him. > 90% of that list were past it or riddled with injuries.  Pogba, Di Maria, Mata, Varane, Bruno, Lukaku, Depay, Shaw, Sancho, Mkhitaryan, Martial and Kagawa should all have been in their prime or younger. I can't remember them being riddled with injuries at the time of signing either.  > Utd's problem since Fergie is they don't buy players the manager wants and don't have any plan for the style of play/players.  I agree with this. They seem to go for fancy names rather than players who will actually improve them. Oh boy, where to start?  Shitty owners at the helm since 2005.   Legendary manager and his successful executive retired at the same time, leaving the reins to an investment banker, who bumbled around for years running the club into the ground.  So over the past decade, there was minimal investment behind the scenes: **the club facilities and the stadium were perpetually stuck in the 2000s**, all while paying astronomical fees and wages for players (many of whom didn't even want to be here). Not to mention the rotating chair of managers, each of whom promptly disregarded the players brought in by the previous manager.  Predictably, we were out of the Champions League most of the time. So it was hard to persuade World Class players to join, and any half-baked player and his club could demand ungodly sums of money. This meant panic buys almost every window, and inability to sell out-of-favor players (because of aforementioned huge wages). Rinse and repeat.    Also there is the issue of the ex-players steadily picking on every little underachievement in the field, giving an air of perpetual toxicity over the past ten years. The match-going fans have been generally supportive though, especially on away games. (Can't say the same about online fans, although we have one of the largest fanbases in the world, so that is to be expected.)  Fast forward to 2024, with new investors and replacement of idiots with actual football people behind the scenes, the expectations have been renewed again.  Here's hoping! the Argentinians hate him...and rightfully so, what he did to Riquelme and Di Maria was disgusting.  Edit: You know who also hated him? CRUYFF himself not to mention ""welcome to Germany"" Because he expects you to make that move, you have to Greco-Roman? The Mourinho effect. Tough love. It's almost impossible to discipline rich kids/players. I guess those who despise him say more about them than Van gaal. And some used to despise him and then loved him (like Depay iirc?) The Duracell bunny. Not surprising. Schweinsteiger was one of the players that benefited the most from his Bayern stint. I have no idea what you are talking about at the end there  The most German response I’ve ever seen 😂 U wouldn’t fly with philosophy  wow. really? > His idea was that he did not care about names at all, you don’t need stars, everybody had to prove themselves again.  seems reasonable If Ribery hates him he must be doing something right. I think he definitely does rate him even if he doesn’t express it very often, however I think he said SAF wasn’t the best manager he ever had. Keane also played for Brian Clough, so another great manager, but I think most people would rate SAF higher in the grand scheme of things. I would imagine Keane also would if he never fell out with him Keane refusing to call him anything but “Ferguson” tells you everything you need to know about he feels about him now, you’ve got Neville and all his other disciples still calling him boss lol There is, but you'll only find a couple of note who actually criticises him and that's probably Tevez and Keane on a bad day.   Beckham, Stam, Ince, RvN etc. all speak well of Ferguson now. There's falling out with players because they don't meet your standards anymore and have to move on, then there's falling out with them because you're just a knobhead. SAF very, very rarely fell into the latter category, which is remarkable given how long he managed at the top level. They're back on good terms now and have been for a while. Neville and Scholes usually don't refer to him by name either, I wouldn't read too much into it Yeah he had 'The Hairdryer' too, which just sounds like a sign of a horrible work environment, however most of his players speak very highly of him so I was a little surprised. Fair point, some do just click/not click. Maybe they fell out a bit at the end but Rooney is the type of guy who normally gets on with everyone so there isn't any bad blood between them now. He’s being polite about it, read the whole quote again, he’s basically saying he was considering playing for United under David Moyes of all people, and then when he found out that Van Gaal was going to be the next manager it was an instant no, he doesn’t like him lol Let's stay on topic man, if we wanted to name all the big players united missed out on we'd be here for days Probably worked better for him in FIFA maybe 😂 Iniesta retired from *professional* football 6 years ago [deleted] Yes he would have moved to us but we didn’t want to pay what Monaco wanted. That wasn’t Mou turning him down. These things all affect each other though. Would we have gone for Kroos if we’d signed Thiago? Eric Eric Djemba > Eric Djemba Djemba  Serbian Super Liga legend [deleted] Then we'd have to switch to a one 6 + two 8s midfield like Real plays. in which Müller would have no spot then.  Either way one of Thiago, Kroos or Müller was bound to leave Well, it's not like they signed many generational talents in the last decade. Poor signings is a big reason they've struggled. Bruno went there in his prime and he's been one of the best playmakers in the world since signing for UTD so who's to say prime Kroos wouldn't have been great regardless. The plan is exactly what they should have been doing and what I hope they're starting to do now with the new structure   Letting the manager completely pick the players doesn't work because then a change in manager makes half your players redundant (essentially) Crazy to think how much dysfunction is in Chelsea, and they even look to be a tier above United already again going off second half of last season and the start to this one. the most mental thing is hiring him early, to hover about first, just prolonging the inevitable. I’d put money on a Ruud interim, then Kieran McKenna appointment in the summer I imagine if the Ipswich manager gives a good account of himself this season he could be in the running as well next year around give it giggsy Actually get Ole back, imo. Who doesn't want to though Who among us hasnt? In a naughty way. Acceptable tbh That was just some bad, bad flirting Maybe if the team was exciting to watch, he would’ve been given more time. They were an absolutely miserable watch though. Yup. Should have given 2-3 seasons. The transition itself from SAF to a new manager would have taken a season or two at the minimum. But MU were a juggernaut back then and only accepted success, anything less would be considered a failure so they did what they did I suppose United fans will be very upset if they hear this, but yeah he definitely needed more time. United fans stood by Ten Hag giving them record lows in the league every year, but Moyes bringing in his own staff was too far despite being a much more hands on manager.  Following after a manager with that much backing is a deathwish. Thanks for the info. yea. ofc Kroos, Pogba and a DM ( Matic was there wasn't he) The streets seem to forget a little considering his name was misspelt here and nobody noticed lol The definition of streets won't forget > Morten Gamst Pederson  Football manager legend That dive though Played last season too at 42.   Not sure if he’s still playing beyond that now though. But only real ones remember Shefki Kuqi. The fact he's still not retired is mind boggling. Swear he feels older than 43 but my time perception these days is was off Pedersen*, -son are for those weirdos, the swedes.   TIL Legend. David Dunn is blue and white,  Blue and white,  Blue and white,  David Dunn is blue and white,  He eats Venky's David Dunn is still offside,  Still offside,  Still offside,  David Dunn is still offside,  He hates Burnley What a player Underrated In today's game he'd have been a star After Roque Santa Cruz obviously Erm excuse me have you seen the glass museum? One of the modern wonders of the world. Doesn't quite compare to Byker and Benwell though. took him a bit though. he couldn't get past Barrios at first What losing 10 euros each training session with Klopp does to Lewa. Also Barrios got himself injured. I don't think it'd be so farfetched to say that Lewandowski would've stayed even longer benched if that didn't happen. Barrios's drop in form was so weird. For a couple of seasons there he looked like the next Raul and was being linked with major clubs. Then suddenly his forms drops off and he ends up in China. IIRC it was actually behind Barrios in the #10 spot.  I’ve been begging for a decade for Poland to play him there because Lewandowski’s link-up play is criminally underrated and we had other capable forwards to use upfront.  For the NT, every opponent double or triple man marks Lewandowski upfront and neutralizes him. Having him play deeper in the midfield and another striker upfront would have either brought defenders out of position or force them to pay attention to more than one forward. Alas, not to be. But also very old Yeah. Barrios erasure should not be tolerated. Heh, cheers. Good luck to you lot. Colombians too due to falcao a bit Brazilians even more - Giovanni called him the 'Hitler of Brazilian players' and hoped Inter would beat Bayern 15-0 in the 2010 CL final with 5 goals from Lucio What did he do to Riquelme? What did he do to di Maria? He's a crybaby of the highest order Softest people around. That's why you hate him. My mind raced to understand what I could have said to get this response lmao Mmm feels like Mourinho is way more loved in general than Van Gaal Nah he just has clear favorites. I honestly can't think of a single player who openly dislikes Mou. Only fanbases. Lol, no. 90% of South American players said that Van Gaal was straight-up prejudiced against them and hated them from day one for no reason other than their background (and a lot of Southern European players like Luca Toni claimed the same). I would say that this is pretty damning. There are a lot of tough disciplinarians in football, and Van Gaal stands amongst them for his... biases. Now imagine how van Gaal explained it… Cristiano Ronaldo still calls him boss ffs > you’ve got Neville and all his other disciples still calling him boss lol  TBF, several of them never played for another manager. It’s like a weird psychological effect, for some reason being an asshole to your players can get you to like them and even run through walls for them.  Maybe its like they see it as a challenge and feel like they have to prove themselves, and when they do succeed, when you finally get the praise of the manager, it washes away all the bad parts along the way and you start seeing it as just part of the journey that got you to where you are right now.  Of course this only works if you succeed. What is “the hairdryer”? Yeah I don’t think Rooney’s the type to hold grudges but his relationship with SAF did become frosty at that time Fine, last 15 years then Are you seriously suggesting Thiago was better than Modric You're club is hilarious when it comes to the players you signed and the ones you couldn't get over the line for either money or contract based issue. Even if he is, which isn't true for an on form Rashford, you wouldn't want to bench Garnacho with another young winger when his potential is so much more. Pogba, Di Maria, Martial (golden boy winner), Varane, etc.   Bruno was the only player I could think of when I wrote my initial comment, but I’m assuming I’m forgetting some others. I think the only thing that makes sense is having a sporting director that has final say on everything and handles the business side of things, and a scouting team that handles... *scouting*. Managers have *a lot* of work to do. They must handle training, they must handle tactics, they must handle the tensions in the lockerroom. They spend so much time off-hours just watching tape from their own league...   What sense does it make to have managers also be scouts and sporting directors? None whatsoever. The manager needs to provide input on the team. What positions he thinks need to be filled, what players could be sold without affecting performance. What players could potentially be replaced by a cheaper player. At most the manager can then give examples of players he has watched and that fit the mold. But that's it.   The scouting team then should, you know, *scout*. Watch a *lot* of tape, a lot of games. Then give a short list and reports showing how the players fit the requirements. The sporting director should then talk to the managers, talk to the teams, and decide of those, which ones would make more financial/logistical sense. And then present the manager with options. ""Hey, if we get this guy you wanted? He'll be expensive and we'd need to compromise on this other position, maybe sell a few of the players that are useful but not needed. But there's this other guy that seems good enough and would allows to also get this other guy without selling anyone.""  Simple division of labour. If you just let the manager pick players? They'll pick three sorts of players: Players they've previously trained, players they've previously played against and the obvious super stars. Because that's whom they have watched extensively. And that's a very limiting way to build a team. The club didn't hire him, Ten Hag chose that. destabilising teams across Europe for an interim manager, Reagan would be proud They will hire Potter, the way INEOS works it will be him Took a relative for a milestone birthday for the Everton game at OT.  Flew in for it.  Lost 1-0. It was cold and silent apart from the Everton fans singing David Moyes is full of shit to o when the saints. And one frustrated fan in the United end screaming at us for being ‘as quiet as micccceee’.  I can see why the fans were not on board. They fired him once they couldn’t qualify for the CL I think it was, but I’d have given him till Christmas the following season.  The first summer was real deer in headlights stuff, maybe he would have been better in the second.  My theory is that he was like a dude who finds out he inherited a mansion and it’s his first night in the place.  He didn’t feel comfy being himself.  He wanted to bring in Fellaini, but then he’s like no they’ll be like Moyes loves a carthorse.  So he faffs around till the release clause is gone.  Wasn’t helped by Gill leaving either. Streets are a little dyslexic, but the memory is STRAWNG Keep up with the society, man. Nowadays they have a new name: Barclays man. Just saw that he's still playing! Legend Fantasy Prem legend too! Yesss he was really good on, I think, the 03-04 one? This was before I'd even heard of him. Then when I saw him sign for Blackburn, I was like Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at the TV. He is not playing, but neither has he retired. Last info I could find is that he is training as if he was playing, and looking for a club (I assume in the top two divisions in Norway). I always had a soft spot for Blackburn. Kuqi was great in FIFA too. I also remember Lucas Reid and Ryan Nelson? being stalwarts for the club. Not in my heart   He couldn’t run out of the centre circle because he loved the cigs but fuck me could he send a ball anywhere he liked outside of it Used to love watching Tugay back in the day. Had the athletic prowess of a 55 year old chain smoker, had the leathery look of a 35 year old chain smoker, had the right peg of a fucking magician. Glass museum is peak Sunderland, almost good actually played behind barrios like a 10 quite a few times back then He was about 27 when he joined Dortmund. Him fucking off to China in his prime and never doing anything noticeable anymore doesn't help with stopping the erasure though. lucio was kicked out of bayern by van gaal for no reason at all. he was a fan favourite and one of the best players in 08/09 (and the years prior). van gaal arrives for 09/10, lucio has to go and instantly wins the treble with inter. He wanted Riquelme to run, press and defend. Also pass the ball quickly.   He was basically a rude pep Guardiola. Riquelme was right and you know it. Mou has that villanous charm though 😂 Also way more hated in general Casillas and Pedro Leon for sure are not fans Luke Shaw probably. And Schweinsteiger for what Mou did to him at United I give him the benefit of the doubt, I don't think he's consciously discriminatory or anything, but he seems to be very stubborn and probably not a great man-manager of people from different cultures. If he was a white nationalist wouldn't the Argentines love him? My bad, it's actually the Hairdryer Treatment. A legendary telling off he does that is so severe that the players named it. Can't imagine being on the receiving end. Thiago and Kroos is worse. Was agreed to sign then the new manager (Moyes and LVG) changed that. All of these players failed for reasons unrelated to the club I think that comprehensively explains how I see it too, fully agree  I'd add to it with the sporting director being in charge (generally) of how the team is supposed to play and hiring a manager in that role  Because asking the manager to do everything is a recepie for disaster, as can be seen extensively Ten Hag may have chose him but he wouldn't be sitting on the bench if united didn't hire him Don't worry, good football will eventually trickle down Do you have literally any evidence to back that up? We don't remember his name, we remember his game insane to think that sponsorship is paying dividends for them decades later. i don't think they could have imagined that. really weird to be so patriotic to what is just a brand. Blackburn legend too! He was a bargain signing for mid-level clubs that paid off massively. I signed him every time. I wanna say 2004 but not sure anymore lol. > I also remember Lucas Reid and Ryan Nelson?  Yes I know. which didn't really work out.   But he had to play it in the first place because he couldn't get past Barrios He's still playing He played him out of position, benched him if he moved into the middle, where he played, and wasted one of the biggest Argentinian talents ever. Guardiola adapted to Messi and to his talented players, that's why Guardiola is an amazing coach and LVG is not.  He also just treated him like shit in general since the first time Riquelme arrived to Barca. He didn't want him and made sure Riquelme knew it, which is just not how you handle a young talent. Definitely. Mou has charming levels Van Gaal could only dream about. Those are.... good points, well made. Schweinsteiger said a few months ago that he always had a respectful relationship with Mourinho and confirmed that Mourinho apologised to him for the way things went football-wise. He shook his hand and responded ""All good, don’t worry"".  I think people sometimes think Mourinho also shows his antics towards players, but I’m sure he is a pretty positive and professional dude in the day to day business. He knows how to talk to people. I wouldn't say it was race-based, but culture-based, tbh. Some old-school protestant work ethic prejudice thing People in this sub love to spread misinformation about Argentines It's based off the cartoons when you yell at someone really loud their hair blows back behind them like a hair dryer. Although you would then put that on the club too for hiring him. It’s the exact same argument as Kroos but in reverse. How do we know they wouldn’t have been (or continued to be) successful elsewhere? I’d wager there’s a culture problem at ManU. I kind of agree. I don't think you even need to have some fancy philosophy or team culture. You just need to have a technically competent sporting director that knows the team and the players. Knows what positions they can do and what they prefer. And understands which players are assets and which could become liabilities.  So long as this position exists and is held by someone with deep knowledge of football and the team? I don't think it needs to include as a responsibility setting up ""the way the team plays"". I think the question is more about knowing how the team dynamics *can* work, and then hiring a manager with a vision and system that the team could match with as few changes as possible.  But that's not to say that a team can't go from playing possession football with a high press under one manager, to a more defensive style based on rapid counters with the next. So long as the pieces required are already there and the sporting director has the belief that the team could meet the demands of both coaches with relatively few changes. > Guardiola is an amazing coach and LVG is not.    Both of them are great coaches. Both champions league winners.   I even give more merit to van gaal as he won with Ajax and reached a second final without seedorf, overmars and rijkaard.    Pep had Messi, etoo, Henry, Iniesta, xavi, and recently beat Inter 1-0 having a billion dollar squad. Oh cool to see. Yeah there's a reason players are willing to run through walls for him. He mastered the human aspect of the game Argentinas racist song about France after Copa America (where France never played) was invented by this sub Possibly but Pogba always had consistency and mental issues. Di Maria struggled to adapt the country, Martial is just one of many youngsters to show promise and never reach expectations and Varane was finished as an elite player when he joined the club. His body couldn't take it anymore.  In 2014, Toni Kroos was 24 and hitting his prime after proving himself at a big club and winning the WC. The closest to him in the ones you mentioned is Pogba and I don't think he would've been successful anywhere because of his own issues. He had his best seasons with Pirlo and Vidal but still showed flaws.  The club has had massive problems but if they actually made good signings, it's not crazy to believe everything else would've been different. French people wouldn't survive a day in south America why are you making valid points on reddit? All your points are valid, well thought out. Pogbas the only one I think should and would have done better in a different environment. But the fact still remains that we’ll never know how Kroos would have fared at ManU. I think a likely outcome would be, he was still great but would have gotten frustrated and left after 3-4 seasons. Lol, like 50% of Patagonia are French tourists, who are also pretty good with Spanish Because? No different environment would of prevented Pogba’s body from failing. That’s something out of anyone’s control. hate crimes South America is more racially diverse than North America and Europe, the fact so many people have problems with banter shows who the racists truly are ""we are not racist, except when we are"" it's banter relax"

Shame Gvardiol didn't take it but I massively respect him turning it down. Goal difference genuinely could be important here and the team is more important than the individual Reading so many braindead comments.  1. Gvardiol didnt want it. Walker asked him 2. Goal Difference might come into play we need all the goals we can get Chelsea players should take notes 3 matches ago Arsenal had a 10 goal advantage over Manchester. We're down to 2. At this rate Manchester might tie in points and still somehow win. Ugh [deleted] goal difference could very well matter, Gvardiol put the team first, got to respect that What a Player, 11 goals and 9 assists in this premier league season. Overall he has 32 goal contributions for man City this season with him being off the second half of the season. Didn’t they scored at least four goals for the past 5-6 league games ? Boooooo we wanted Josko hatty WHY NOT GVARDIOL FFS Huge controversy over the penalty City got last week because Gvardiol got a shot off and was then smashed by Ait Nouri.  Alvarez gets his shot off here and is then tackled by Diop but nothing is mentioned.  r/soccer baffles me. Did Gvardiol appeal to take it or why did they focus on him talking with Walker? [deleted] Go fly a kite Honestly can something fun happen for once or is prem gonna continue to boring Should have let gvardiol take it Gvardiol should've stepped up Look at this fake plastic club they don't even let the player with two goals take the pen.  Marcus Aurelius 168 AC Gvardiol is a coward. If it comes to GD, City will likely have drawn one and won one, with Arsenal winning two. That'd mean City need to outscore Arsenal by at least four goals vs Spurs / West Ham  Really think it's too late to matter  Edit: outscore by at least three to make things level Especially down 3-0.  If you think you're saving a draw then okay I get it but it's 3-0 in the 90+, you know you're not winning..... Diop is a comedy footballer, he just can’t do it against the top teams. Thought he turned the corner vs Brentford but apparently that was a one-off. Like I understand that we’re Fulham and the odds are against us but 4-0 is not acceptable, he was directly at fault for 2 of the goals at least. Last season Pep almost shot Gundo for taking a pen (and missing) when Haaland was still on the pitch, I don't think the team is moving away from the designated taker anytime soon lol Would have been the first defender to ever get a hattrick in the premiership. Shows how much the team matters, I am impressed. Especially since we need the insurance of goal difference It's not as if GD or even goals scored is out of the question as well, every goal might matter You could see him mouthing ""I've got 2 already"" while shaking his head lol how do you know he wasn’t confident? Probably just wants Julian to score a goal Huh? To me it looks like Gvardiol wanted it but he can’t take it unless Alvarez offers it He did not put the team first he wanted that lol There's also obviously a penalty prio list with 1. Haaland, 2. Alvarez. This isn't FM where the guy on a hattrick automatically takes it. gray pot mindless rustic panicky berserk compare fuel repeat rinse   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Realistically not really, GD only matters if city draw   Which means only way for city to win on GD is if Arsenal win both games 1-0 and city win the remaining game 6-0 Almost, Forest away broke a streak.  Goal difference could end up mattering so it's worth them scoring as many as possible. He didn't want it This is not chelsea Honestly just let the man have his hattrick lol The hilarity of a Chelsea flair commenting this should not be lost on anyone. It looked like he was saying no to me. Walker was clearly asking him if he wanted it Looked like Walker was asking if Gvardiol wanted to take it. He said he didn’t want to take it and Walker was like wtf are you sure mate Looked like he bottled it imo They let him, he just didn’t want to He didn’t want it and knew importance of GD If you had actually watched you would have seen that he didn't want to take it Now the second Chelsea flair saying this. Like players, like fans? Enjoy second for the second year in a row 😃 The offered hit to him he said no probably wanted the best pk taker for goal diff West Ham got battered a lot this season, it's not impossible for City to beat them by 4 or 5 goals. More than that is probably really hard though and I think Arsenal will destroy United and Everton, at least either one if not both anyway so yeah too late to matter >outscore by at least three to make things level   Which then turns the tiebreaker to Goals Scored, does it not? In which case it's still us on top. inb4 United beats Arsenal 5-0, City loses 1-0 to Spurs then draw with West Ham with Arsenal beating Everton 1-0 on the last day Shouldn't be hard to do tbf doesn't Arsenal have the H2H advantage? I’m convinced City are going to go on a Bayern Munich type run in the PL, which is insane to me. Tbf that backfired almost immediately, pep was right to go ape shit  Gundo missed and Leeds went onto score immediately after making it 2-1 It’s a weird stat. Steve Watson got one for Everton but ‘he was playing in midfield’ that day so it doesn’t count.  Given how far up the pitch Gvardiol gets to play (he’s in the opposition box more than his own based on heat maps for the season) then you’ve got to wonder what actually counts as playing in midfield. For real? Walker was trying to convince him to take it. If he wanted to, he would have Captain chooses who gets to take it Looks like he said no Walker was asking him if he wanted it and he was very clearly indicating ""No"" Pep obviously unselected that option Just the two goals and points difference, everything is fine🙂 Except on Tuesday of course when I hope they get eight. Check your maths City would only need to win 4-0 against West Ham Yeah you’re right. They’ve score at least four goals in six of the past seven games. They’re fucking ruthless I'd love a wild scenario where in order to be crowned champions City would have to score like 6 or 7 goals I doubt it will Does he not realise my FPL is depending on him? Rude of him tbh Jon Snow regen Really? Seemed like he was talked out of it by Dias & Walker They all know I have him on FPL? Most likely, unless Arsenal win 5-4 at united or something stupid  Was mainly clarifying that it should be enough You’re not drawing or losing any games so it’s all moot anyway Head to head is behind goal difference and goals scored in tiebreaker precedence for the Premier League By that logic no classical fullback is ""playing in defense"" No for mancity Arsenal currently have 60 GD + 2 form both their wins = 62   City have 58, needing 4-0 win to tie with arsenal and 5-0 win to have advantage   I forgot about today's 4tha goal that's why I messed it up 4-0 for both teams to have equal GD, 5-0 for city to win  I messed up because I forgot today's 4th goal my bad All it takes is a draw against Spurs and it's on to goal difference. Considering City have scored a single goal in the spurs ground, it's not impossible that happens It's unlikely, but still you play for every advantage possible. Yeah I think at this point the only way our goal difference catches up with Arsenal is if they lose and then goal difference won’t matter. He got a 21 pter what more do you want😭 It was the opposite. He clearly said that he has 2 goals already He wasn't forcing it I think but ofc it would look silly if he misses and we draw at Tottenham and then only win 5-0 and lose the league. Your players had a full blown row on the spot about taking a penalty when they were already 4-0(?) up I don’t disagree. I think the discourse around positions, especially at the elite level in this day and age is completely antiquated. Lmao A 4 nil win wouldn’t be a tie, City would win on goals scored. If City draw and Arsenal win by the bare minimum of 1 goal a game they'd be up 4 GD. City would have to win by 5 goals. Say Arsenal beat United 1-0 tomorrow and we draw with Spurs midweek. We'd go in to the last game needing to either better Arsenal's result of if we both win by 3 more goals than they do. Would've been 4 if Gvardiol takes that pen and misses. It's not impossible we end up in that situation and one goal less makes it slightly more possible, especially since West Ham have had a few spankings already this year. TO CATCH MY ML LEADER think you're reaching a bit mate If you are not wearing mittens Johan Cruiff does not believe in positions and neither does /u/TheKingMonkey Oh I didn't know that, I thought a tie in GD would lead to h2h matches, thanks for clearing that up technically since City has scored more goals than Arsenal they'd only have to tie GD. So City would have to win by a minimum of 4 goals. But likely more because Arsenal is probably winning by a couple goals each game They just won by 4 today. They could easily win by 5 We’d only need to win by 4 because goals for is the next tiebreaker Yeah true, but with the way they’re playing I can’t see us out scoring Arsenal by that much. Think you're taking a joke a bit too seriously mate Total Football bro. 👊 Wouldn't put it past United to pull a result out of their arse tbf. Also wouldn't be surprised if Arsenal spank them for 5/6 but until we know the result tomorrow then every goal matters and Gvardiol did the right thing. Was very mature of him tbf. Where was the joke 😂"
