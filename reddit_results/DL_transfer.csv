"Aston Villa FFP position explained as Douglas Luiz transfer speculation intensifies. Aston Villa are one of a number of Premier League teams said to be close to the PSR threshold.","2024-06-09T20:04:36+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1dc2se6/aston_villa_ffp_position_explained_as_douglas/","[No textual content]","1238","DebtFairPlay","https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-ffp-position-explained-29314874","""Intensifies""   Romano posted a filler tweet about it other day. There's nothing solid on them selling Luiz. Just journalists feeding off each other's bull as per. Rumour has been Juventus want them but are also trying to lowball us with ridiculous valuations of McKennie and Luiz Sell a hotel . Problem solved Quick!  Sell a hotel to yourself! Why are people in this thread acting like:  * Villa aren't a traditionally big side? * Villa haven't spent almost £500 million over the last 5 years? * Villa don't have one of the richest owners in the league?  There's people in this thread comparing them to fucking Leicester and Brighton like come on? This literally doesnt explain anything.  How has this even been allowed on the soccer subreddit? We don't even allow birmingham mail articles on the Villa subreddit I don't like what's happening to Villa.  As an Everton fan we took a risk and overspent but I've had it described to me that Villa did the same thing and they'd get the PL after them too.  Only Villa made a jump with that investment while my team couldn't.  Villa are getting punished for investment.  I guess the idea is that both teams injected cash that wasn't part of revenue and they shouldn't have had access to?  But then how did Chelsea get away with spending so much?  They do sell well but selling well doesn't make up for all their ridiculous purchases.  My team was in relegation danger for three straight seasons.  It hasn't been smooth sailing for Villa either.  I guess there are less complicated cases like Villa, Everton, and Forest but man there are teams that are outright penalized or at least forced to sell players meanwhile City has gotten away with all their trickery for years and to great success both in terms of their team and building  as a global brand. English football over the last 15 years has positioned itself in a way that ensures no-one outside of the current ‘big 6’ will ever win the Premier League again outside of an obscene 1/5000 fluke like Leicester. I give in 10 years until the Prem starts seriously pushing for no relegation. Surely there’s a couple of hotels in Birmingham They could buy cheap and then sell to themselves to generate some cash People up in arms about City when the top six have been a Super League for years now.   Build yourselves up like Newcastle, Villa and Brighton, then the rules insist you must sell your best talent to the top teams, who have bigger budgets.   No wonder young people are switching off in record numbers. They just made champs league and still have to sell. Bollocks Something needs to change football clubs are meant to be about civic pride in your city playing against other cities best teams (I know that idea is long gone) but it’s only going to get worse. The real competitive league is the 20 teams fighting to increase revenue squeezing fans, £80 for a replica shirt, post season tours of Australia, pre season tours of America, season ticket holders being priced out for corporate packages/ tourist tickets and now talk of playing some fixtures abroad. All the clubs can’t make all the money in the world to compete with each other the horse has bolted the only regulation that will come in now is to increase the divide between the clubs and their fans. I understand the idea behind FFP, but let’s be honest, it’s just bullshit, isn’t it? Aston Villa finally get into the premier league, but are forced to sell their best players. Yet City, and Chelsea (especially under Ambramovich) can go from well supported, but unsuccessful teams, to financial giants in the space of a few years.   All this is doing is ensuring PSG, Real, City, Chelsea, United, etc, stay the top teams. “Oh, hey Newcastle! Hey Villa! You’ve made your way into Europe! You wanna compete and stay there? Well fuck you! You haven’t been in this position for a few years so sell sell sell!” Real talk - Is this fair?  Why should a red club be allowed to be £1b in debt, allowed to constantly spending money on shit players, to finish outside top 4 and still be able to spend £200m a season but Villa can't? Villa are currently taking up space the PL have reserved for the big 6 (7 once Newcastle really get going). Villa have to be restricted so they can drop down to a far more acceptable level. The net result of these changes is that the Club has reported a loss for the year of £119.6m after tax. This compares with a small profit of £0.3m in the prior year. It is important to note that these figures are in line with the strategic business plan, and **we continue to operate within the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules**. The owners of Aston Villa remain committed to the long-term and sustainable development of the Club, and we look forward to continued progress on the delivery of our strategic plan.  [https://www.avfc.co.uk/news/2024/march/04/aston-villa-end-of-year-accounts/](https://www.avfc.co.uk/news/2024/march/04/aston-villa-end-of-year-accounts/) FFP was designed to keep the biggest clubs at the top If 1/3 of the league are close to the PSR threshold then surely the rules and allowances need to be looked at otherwise the league is just stifling itself City Fan : Never since my grandfather started supporting the club, was my club in such a position. Disgraceful!!  Chelsea fan : AMen!! FFP was created by Liverpool and United Owners so no one can challenge them Football was fine with free market spending for over 100 years until Chelsea come along.  Then later, Man City. The established elites don't like ""up-starts"" outbidding them for talents.  FFP came about.    UEFA should have focus on debt instead.  Debt Fair Play.    Clubs can spend as much as they want as long as they have low debt (maximum debt is cap at 50% of annual revenue so a club with 400m in revenue can have at most 200m ni debt....infrastructure debt does not count).  Owners also need to put money into a escrow for future spending to cover future salaries / transfer fees paid in case they walk away.  The benefit of Debt Fair Play / Escrow is that it allow for mobility.  For challengers to emerge.  It also protect clubs from high debt which is usually the main driver for club bankruptcy. Feels like they could easily just sell someone else who is, ya know, not integral to the side. A Serie A team lowballing and offering ridiculous swap deals, it must be a day ending in y *McKennie, 60 Euros we won't pay you and two left over slices of pepperonis. A cup of Cappuccino as add-ons for each Ballon d'Or Luiz wins in Turin.* Dont bother waste time with these low balling broke ass italian clubs Maybe there is a better model than FFP/PSR.  Debt Fair Play along with Escrow model is fairest to the big clubs, the medium clubs and the small clubs. Everyone have a chance.  Debt Fair play. This target debt, the main cause of club bankruptcy. Limit each club debt to 60% of its annual revenue (infrastructure debt is not counted)  Escrow. For club who are spending more than 100% of annual revenue, then the part above the 100% will need to put into escrow in case the owner walk away.  This will allow for club mobility and prevent ladder-pulling (GOOD). This prevent clubs going bust (GOOD). This put more money into the football ecosystem/pyramid (GOOD).    An ambitious owner of a club like Fulham could spend and have a good shot at the Champions League spot and at the same time the club is protected from going bust. Aston Villa needs to adopt a sister company ASAP Also, weren't Villa basically fucked if they didn't get promoted when they did? I could've swore they were like right on the line financially and if they hadn't won the playoff, they'd have gone out of business or something. Because you're conflating the important factors for FFP/PSR, namely revenue, with other things. Tradition doesn't matter, having an incredibly rich owner doesn't always matter (largely all prem club owners cover the allowable loss for PSR anyway, and villa aren't pumping themselves with bullshit sponsorships and the like). They've spent crazy money yes but Grealish will have covered an entire season's worth of amortization in one transfer.   The financial controls in this league will come back to bite Villa, just like they did for us and basically any smaller club that wants to commit more resources to compete at a higher level. One bad season is enough to throw the balance of the books off-kilter, suddenly you're selling to buy with a European-sized squad without the finances of European football. Villa was big **before 1992.**  pre-1992 football in England doesn’t exist for a large chunk of people I'm just curious, why do you think being ""a traditionally big side"" matters to this situation at all?  And to your second point, Villa spending almost 500mil in the last 5 years is exactly why they are bumping up against PSR. Never thought I’d fight side-by-side with a bluenose. See I don’t get this. I agree the rules are bs and a joke but I’ve seen so many genuine comments that seem to act like Aston Villa haven’t been one of the biggest spenders in the league for the last 3/4 years. They’re a big club competing with a big budget end of not some Cinderella Luton style fairytale. I think FFP/PSR is not legal without player union Colllective bargaining agreement.  ChinggisKhagan wrote this:  If your workplace makes an agreement with every similar business in the country that they should only spend a low enough percentage of revenue on wages to guarantee profitability then you should sue them. That would obviously be illegal.  -------------  sound almost identical for FFP.  I am sure that many players have been told in salaries negotiation that management ""can not pay them more due to FFP/PSR restrictions"" Because sales are important. They account as pure profit. Whereas players signings are amortised. So for Chelsea this year they start with Mount £55m, Hall £30m bonuses of around £15m from players who played in champions league final plus whoever they sell. Players who they’ve bought in the last couple years are amortised of that amount (Enzo and Caicedo are about £15m each for example).   That’s even before revenue comes into it. Or they start selling Gallagher, Chalobah, Broja etc. Selling home grown players is massive for finances, whether that’s correct or not. >I give in 10 years until the Prem starts seriously pushing for no relegation.  They might push for it but it is hard to see any Government allow something like this to happen. This is one of the reasons City are going after the prem In the last 10 years Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have won 1 PL title between them. Spurs have 1 League cup in the last what 30 years? I don’t know who you think the league is protecting trophy wise, but it ain’t big clubs, it’s small clubs with corrupt owners who’ve get all the cream. Talk of big 6 ignores the fact that 2 of those clubs have completely different interests and get to break the laws or the game at will. I mean that's true but this goes for almost every other top flight league. No one is challenging bayern most years except in exceptional circumstances like Dortmund getting Klopp or Leverkusen getting Alonso. No one is challenging PSG period. No one is challenging Madrid or Barca. Atleti have snuck in there too but they're not in a position to do so every single year. And it's another case like BVB or Leverkusen, of them getting a generational manager in Simione. Only difference is they've managed to hold on to him.   Most of the clubs in the top leagues have the same winners every year.  And it's honestly never going to change with the way it's set up. It's almost impossible to change it to a system like the NBA have where salary caps and the draft means all team's can compete and also have small windows to do so.   The premier league is actually one of the few leagues that it is possible for more than 2  teams to win. Granted it's always mostly been one team winning and maybe one other team will get one title in between but it's the only top league where financially 6 teams can compete if they get their shit together. No relegation will never be a thing. It's a good part of the excitement of the Premier league. The broadcasters would intervene. The premier league was pushing for no relegation in the 80s and 90s I would not be surprised if the PL limit relegation to 2 spots instead of 3 in the next 20 years.  This would save a lot of money in term of parachute payment.  As for no relegation at all, the backlash would be HUGE.  Even more than the backlash against the Super League.  So it will never happen in the next 100 years. How is this the most upvoted comment. The league will never push for relegation to be scrapped. It prides itself on being the ‘most competitive league in the world’ and it would absolutely scupper the whole structure of English football. The backlash for even suggesting it would be on a level with the Super League backlash.  The PSR regulations aren’t designed to protect the ‘big six’, they’re designed to prevent a repeat of what Chelsea and City did to become the size of club they did in the short space of time that they did, which absolutely shouldn’t happen again in that way. This isn’t about protecting the ‘big six’ it’s about protecting the competitiveness of the league.   You don’t let more clubs start injecting cash to level the playing field and if that’s ’protecting the big six’ then it’s necessary in the short term. They don’t need to codify anything like this, the current trajectory or world football means Championship teams will inevitably be too far behind the Premier League to stay up after promotion, anyway. Don't remember big picture? Or they are trying to find ways to avoid clubs getting themselves into trouble. Clubs voted in these rules. Also big 6 is better than the situation in a lot of leagues.  They can vote on rules but that's not something that could come up as they still answer to the FA on that kind of thing. You mean the big 8 “Like Newcastle, Villa and Brighton”  One of these things is not like the other. As if Spurs didn't build themselves up the last 20 years? No idea why we get lumped into these ultra fuck off wealth clubs as if we were always there.  Spurs were 15th in Revenue in the PL 24 years ago. Newcastle and Villa were MILES ahead of Spurs. As were Blackburn, Leeds. Spurs had the same revenue as bloody Charlton Athletic ffs.  People talk about how no teams can get in around the big boys but Spurs have proven it's possible.  But ofc fuck that, yesterday you'd have been memeing about Spurs being a nothing club I'm sure, all because we've spent decades building ourselves up to even be in the conversation of the Big6 and making sure we don't overspend and leave ourselves up shit creek.  And yeah, for years we had to sell our best players to the bigger clubs. And we invested that money properly and made sure we had revenue streams outside of football to improve our financials. So no FFP rules or any kind ever?  get yourself a super rich owner or bugger off?  The rules don't insist that at all, at the moment it's not losing 105m over 3 years, that's not that tight.  Also UEFA have FFP rules too. “Building yourself up” means better academy, better coaching, smarter transfers etc. Not a fuck-off rich owner deciding to swoop in declare their pet project should be on top. > Build yourselves up like Newcastle, Villa and Brighton, then the rules insist you must sell your best talent to the top teams, who have bigger budgets.   How about Tottenham? Where do they fit in to this very convenient view of things. Are they old money? A sugar daddy club? Yeah, young people are switching off because Newcastle and Villa have spent loads of their obscene wealth and are temporarily inhibited before they get to spend even more. They also both got to enjoy playing in the Champions League.  I don’t really believe young people are switching off. If they are, it’s because they’re finding streams because TV is very expensive during an economic crisis. The only reason they're in this position is because of overstretching their finances in the first place, which is entirely unsustainable and is exactly why they agreed to these rules in the first place Arsenal couldn't permanently sign Raya last season because of PSR and couldn't sign anyone in the 2022/2023 winter window to avoid breaching the limit. Chelsea had to sell hotels to stay under the limit. Erm, can I just say that two of the current 'Big 6' did build themselves up? Liverpool were a traditionally big team but we'd been utter shite for years before Klopp came in and every season was a battle to finish Top 4. We'd have one good season maybe finishing 3rd and then finish 6th the year after. We won Cups and stuff but we weren't a consistent team, and our revenues were massively behind teams like Arsenal and United.  We've literally spent the past 14 years growing organically under our new owners, spending what we earned, selling for big fees, becoming a consistent Top 4 team etc, not breaking FFP, spending on infrastructure to grow our revenues. Spurs are exactly the same. It's completely possible to build organically if you have patience. Brighton nearly fell out of the football league 20 years ago and now are a top half PL side. Why's that? Because they consistently built up and had achievable goals. Tony Bloom said when they got in the PL, the aim was to stay up, nothing more and nothing less. They had a couple of years finishing 15th-17th and building a platform. Then the aim was to consistently finish in the middle of the table, which they did, and then they pushed into the Europa League. Compare that to Leicester who have gone from being Champions to Relegated in the same time period, because they didn't have a consistent plan.  It's hilarious that FFP/PSR gets branded as a thing to protect the Big 6, when as far as I know the only clubs who haven't had FFP/PSR issues in the past few years are Liverpool and Spurs. Arsenal had to get Raya on loan because they were so close to their PSR limit last season, Chelsea had to sell a hotel to be compliant, United have had various issues and City are obviously City. And you know how they stayed compliant? Because they accepted they might have to sell a huge player to invest in the squad for the long term. Spurs didn't really want to sell Bale, but the money they made allowed them to go and spend £100m on players. We didn't really want to sell Coutinho, but we accepted that a record fee for him meant we could buy Alisson and Van Dijk, who would have a bigger long term impact on the team. Anti FFP arguments are the most dumbest and put of touch stuff in football.  The reason for FFP is to protect from owners overspending and clubs going down. CL money comes next season iirc, they need to balance the book for the previous year UCL money doesnt come in until after you have competed in it... You clearly do not understand the idea behind FFP and what it is  Your logic is even worse, you only see a couple of teams that have made it to Europe in Villa/Newcastle and think it's some underdog great story, do you see smaller teams who overspend so much that go down and fuck themselves over Disagree. It's ensuring the sustainability of the clubs.  Yes, a team which only got promoted a few years ago, cannot just have money pumped in by a rich owner and all of a sudden be challenging the top 6 every season. We have seen what happens when billionaires get bored and pull the plug, and these clubs face extinction. Yet still people are so turned on by the idea of a rich Arab getting them CL football every year they're turning against the rules which are there to protect them.  Villa want to be a top 6 club? They still can, build the brand, increase revenue streams, invest further in academy infrastructure, invest in people at the top level to take the club forward. Spurs did it, others can too. This is an absolutely major out of context assessment of where Aston Villa are.  Villa have spent years spending way more than most other clubs in the division on, frankly, utterly mid talent.  They've spent way more money than most other clubs while making absolutely zero money back, mostly without European football too. Know why they've been able to do that? Because the plucky little train that could Aston Villa, have the third-richest owners in the Premier League.  They spend almost all of their turnover trying to fund themselves and its catching up with them.  FFP says ""Spend within your means. Don't over-spend and put the club's financials at risk."" Villa have ignored that and carried on believing that, because they're not a top six club, the rules don't apply to them.  They weren't ""forced to sell their best players"" at all. Outside of Grealish, they haven't been forced to sell any starter who didn't ask to leave.   FFP needs to be increased because of inflation and various other factors, but no, Villa spent like crazy and never bothered to balance the books. If Villa didn't want to have to sell to buy they shouldn't have spent close to 100m on Coutinho, John Duran, and Buendia. > but are forced to sell their best players  No one is forcing them to sell their best players. If they had done what other clubs have done and not overspent then they'd be fine but clearly they though they could push their luck No, it's more like, ""Hey Newcastle, Hey Villa, you spent £800m between you over the past 5 years and quite a lot of those players didn't work out. That's nobody's fault but your own, and if you can't make it work on the pitch, you're going to need to either sell some of them or increase your revenues before you can spend even more!"" LOL, FFP was created in part to stop us! We warned you all this could happen but because it wasn’t happening to them yet, they didnt give a shit Aston Villa owners are happy to spend more money to establish themselves among the Top 4.  But they can't.  So the players (labor) are negatively affected since management can pay more but unable to due FFP.  FFP might be illegal under EU/UK law.  FFP, which restrict spending on players when compare to a free market, might be violating EU/UK antitrust laws due to the lack of collective bargaining agreement with the player union that would have to agree to such restriction. If a group of players sued... Because they're one of the richest clubs in the world, why shouldn't they be allowed to spend it? I’ve not heard an alternative from all the people that moan about PSR and FFP benefiting the bigger clubs. The bigger clubs can spend more because they have the revenues to do so from being bigger clubs. Chelsea are under PSR pressure and have been for the last few years because of no CL revenues. United are talking about selling players in order to buy. Arsenal’s spending was relatively curtailed over the years we were out of the CL.  So what, all clubs other than the big 6 should just be allowed to spend as much as their owners want? How did that turn out for Portsmouth and Leeds?  And Villa haven’t exactly been shopping in bargain bins. Transfers in the last 3 years with Transfermarkt figures:  - Diaby - €55m  - Pau Torres - €33m  - Diego Carlos - €30m  - Coutinho - €20m plus his astronomical wages  - Buendia - €38.4m  - Digne - €30m  - Danny Ings - €29.4m  Those are not insignificant figures for a club that was in the Championship a few seasons ago and has only had one season of Europa Conference participation revenue. Villa are being restricted because they simply don’t have the revenue to support more player purchases in a way that doesn’t put the club at risk if the owners get flaky, not because “the League” (which is, by the way, composed of 20 voting member clubs…) has determined them to be unacceptable challengers Why would they have to drop down? If they’re good enough, then they can finish in the top 6 once again, cement their position and continue to grown once they get the CL money.   It’ll be difficult, but finishing at the top end of the table shouldn’t be easy. You know, considering your club spent 20 years in the shit because they gambled the house on qualifying for the CL every year and spending money they didn't have, I'd have thought you'd understand why FFP exists. Why would Newcastle ever break into the top 6 if PSR is protecting top 6 interests? They play by the same rules as Villa and everyone else. Crazy coming from a Leeds fan I love the smaller clubs who overspent above their means playing the victim in the Premier League, you have even promoted teams spending so much gambling to stay up and clubs like you and Everton spending way above their means But what's the alternative here? A pissing contest with the world's dodgiest billionaires?    Villa have spent beyond their means for years and this could be the chickens coming home to roast. A 90% wage to turnover is ridiculous.  We should be trying to move away from the dodgy billionaires funding things, make clubs more sustainable, look at capping the spending power of the biggest clubs to make things more competitive at the highest level and spread around the money even more equally then it already is. It's designed to make sure that you don't bankrupt yourselves chasing the dream, which you lot are very much doing.  Since selling Grealish, you've bought in Bailey, Ings, Coutinho, Buendía, Digne, Dendoncker, Durán and Torres and made very little money back on any other sales.  You spend far too much of your turnover and that is genuinely just stupid no matter how rich your owner is. In fact, the fact that your owner is so rich is a massive reason why what you've been doing is so unfair on the rest of the clubs. [deleted] Agreed. Same boat as Newcastle right now. It's not restricted to just our clubs either. There's an obvious anti-competitiveness that FFP brings. Sure it stops new clubs over spending to break into the top 6, but then it also creates a safety barrier for the current top 6 clubs.    I hope Aston Villa fairs a bit better in CL than Newcastle did. But holy shit, if you guys get ravaged by injuries too, it's going to suck.   Instead of a FFP, clubs should have a fixed spending cap, but player prices are already fucked. This will be unpopular opinion on here but FFP might be illegal under EU/UK law for breaking free market regulation without labor consent in the form of CBA.  ChinggisKhagan wrote this:  If your workplace makes an agreement with every similar business in the country that they should only spend a low enough percentage of revenue on wages to guarantee profitability then you should sue them. That would obviously be illegal  --------------------  If a group of players sue UEFA/PL/La Liga for antitrust, they might have a good case.  Player X on trial as witness:  Management told me they can not pay me more.  They specifically said FFP cap their ability to pay more  Management X on trial as witness:  Yes, I did tell the player that we can't pay more because of FFP.  We are fearful of points deductions.  We are fearful of UEFA not letting us compete in their competition. You should know that instead of proving the existence of the supposed ""Red Cartel"", all you've managed to do over these past few days is to make yourself sound like a weird conspiracy theorist. You are moving the goal post to fit your agenda.  Idk how old you are but the “free market” (which is only a theoretical concept that has never existed) era of the game was never fine. Many teams have over spent themselves into the ground and the area of the 90s and 00s saw many clubs perish chasing European football then their owners disappear.  If it was to continue to there would a similar situation with an entrenched top6 but a graveyards of clubs who wanted to have a go.  FFP allows for smart recruitment to win if spending within their means. Eg. Leicester who won it all without having to break their budget. It was only after when they became poorly managed did they get into trouble.  If you look all over Europe many teams are fighting with the big boys. The reason why in the EPL things look so bleak is because the top clubs are state run. Unless you are another state run team or entrenched top6 club you can’t compete not bc of FFP I know I loved it when Chelsea bought Parker in January during our best season.  I'm sure all the owners would vote to put the money needed to cover every contract and fee into an account ahead of time.  This desire now that everyone should just get a crazy rich guy is daft. Chelsea and City were the issue not the model for moving forward. I love that you think that can't be easily exploited. Why dont stupid villa just sell Travis Patterson for 100mil instead of Douglas Luiz But they need to sell somebody who is, you know, sellable for a lot of money.  And who exactly would that be? We would much rather sell Luiz with 2 years left on his contract.  He's been poor for all of 2024 and for me is more replaceable than Martinez, Watkins, even McGinn and Kamara. We should sell if we can get 65M+. While I don’t disagree that Italian football is relatively broke, it’s always funny to see the same people complain about oil-rich clubs ruining football and driving fees to crazy levels. It’s ironic how you can criticize both the lack of funds in traditional leagues and the excessive spending by wealthy new clubs, whatever benefits you in the moment I guess. Pretty much yes. We owed a boatload of tax that we couldn’t pay back. Would’ve been screwed if the new owners didn’t come in. Yup, turns out the fit and proper owners test can be passed by a mysterious Chinese 'billionaire' nobody had ever heard of, with a demonstrably false history and questionable finances They also barely stayed up because of a freak failure of goal line technology as well I believe But on the other hand, you have owners who put tons of debt on the club books in an effort to compete and if it doesn’t work out, they cut their loses and you have a club that’s not attractive at all to potential buyers leading to administration and complete collapse.  Allowing owners to spend whatever they want as long as it’s cash, not debt could hurt the competitiveness of the league. Restricting spending to a %age of the lowest clubs revenues is an interesting idea but could allow non-English clubs like PSG and Real to get too far ahead.  Unpopular opinion, but there’s no obvious solution here on how you balance sustainability, fairness to teams who’ve had the ladder pulled up on them & competitiveness vs foreign teams. They bit you because you wasted record fees you got for players on utter trash, not because of FFP. It's possible to be a selling club as long as you buy well too like Brighton, and you didn't. Villa have a European Cup! When Wenger took over arsenal villa had an equivalent amount of trophies (or maybe more?) and a slightly bigger stadium.    I said this once in the arsenal sub Reddit as a way of showing that we could easily have been in a villa type situation without Wenger or villa more like us with the right decisions and luck. Got downvoted a lot.   That said I think a lot of arsenal fans dislike villa quite a lot (myself included).  Villa have always been big. Anyone who doesnt think Villa are in the 6 biggest clubs doesnt know football Except the EFL isn’t just any workplace, it has specific carveouts by the government to ensure financial sustainability and resilience. fan backlash would be huge  government will put a law into place real quick after the huge fan protest Ya it will never ever happen.   It would be cataclysmic, moreso than the Super League backlash. Why? They allowed it in rugby But 2 of those 6 (by your logic) would also invite other clubs into that threshold? Newcastle and Fulham both have loaded owners who can't spend to compete under the current rules, rumours of Aston villa having to sell when they've just had a very very good season because of the current rules. It's impossible to compete under the current rules because you need to be perfect, while the teams above you can mess up and still consistently outspend you. It's not really about winning the league for these teams, it's qualifying for Europe, as that's the biggest and most realistically sustainable cashcows  Money men at big 6 clubs accept they can't win the league every year - but they can pull up the ladder so that they monopolise European spots  You're kidding yourself if you think Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are trying to fix the league structure to keep that for themselves man city and whom?  Or are you just making shit up? The Premier League didn't exist in the 1980s. Yeah, Brighton haven’t spent shit loads of money like Newcastle and Villa. Every club should be allowed to spend the same maximum amount, while that maximum should be capped at a level that's agreed between all involved. No club backed by state wealth should be able to spend a billion in each window.   If football fans can't understand the concept of fairness amongst those in the league then nothing will change. Breaking the status quo is still a good thing. All the financial rules implemented were only ever supposed to keep the top clubs at the top. Chelsea and City were just lucky they got in before the ladder was pulled up. > And yeah, for years we had to sell our best players to the bigger clubs. And we invested that money properly and made sure we had revenue streams outside of football to improve our financials  Beyond that, Spurs have only really sold Kane, Walker, Trippier, Bale, Modric to big clubs for real money in the past 15 years. None of those guys were cases where you *had* to sell, more than the money was right and the players wanted a move. That's the definition of smart business, buying these guys, developing them, selling them only if the money is right and the player wants to go, not buying them with an eye towards selling them. >I don’t really believe young people are switching off.  Yeah, don't let facts get in the way of your gut feel. 🤣 >couldn't sign raya  Arsenal had spent 200m already at the time. It's funny how you're downvoted by fans of teams eager to buy their way to the top while branding themselves as underdogs We've all played FM before mate, but the situation is still bollox you missed the part where ffp was only introduced once city and chelsea became major threats to legacy clubs   they just use clubs going bust as a way to pretend that they are doing this for the little guy The idea behind FFP is to stop another Man City or Chelsea  >think it's some underdog great story  Nobody thinks that. Almost everyone can see that both Villa and Newcastle invested well and turned their clubs into teams capable or qualifying for the CL  But after all that investments to turn themselves from lower end or mid table teams into European sides, they get punished for it Man U have 773 million of debt and finished 8th.  Villa have 10 mill and came 4th.   Guess who’s allowed to spend more.  Warra meritocracy and warra sustainability safe guard. [deleted] Villa have spent well. Every club has some bad transfers  > making absolutely zero money back  £100m from Grealish, £20m for Chukwuemeka, £20m for Archer, £15m for ings, £15m Ramsey  To get better and push up the league you’ve got to spend. Villa are spending less than the big 6 and still progressing. How can you balance the book when you're building a squad? It would be one step forward and two back. You don't have squad players you can sell for massive profit like bigger clubs can.   Villa got promoted and have had to spend to stay in the league. Outside of Grealish, nobody else was trying to buy their starters. holy shit you're clueless >they shouldn't have spent close to 100m on Coutinho, John Duran, and Buendia.  Lol it wasn't anywhere near close to 100m for those three. Buendia was 33 mil and he's fucking awesome. Coutinho was 20 and a waste of space. Duran was 15 and given his age will no doubt be sold for a profit. Your math ain't mathing. Transfermarlt has them as: Duran 16.64m, coutinho for 20m and buendia for 38.4m. That's not quite 100m  City spent 50m on nunes, 50m on Mendy, 50m on Phillips, 100m on grealish. The issue a lot of people have is some clubs are allowed to get it wrong and its no big deal, others do and they have to pay the price  And in case you want to sat city are being done for it, united bought Antony, casemiro, mount, hojlund, sancho, varane, van de beek for over 400m and arguably need to replace/ buy players in the same position for all of them  Chelsea have spent over 1billion (yeah they've sold, but if rules let you spend 1 billion by selling academy players, there's a problem with the rules) Buendia was a very good signing for Villa and they've spent wisely for the most part for a team which was in the Championship less than a decade ago. What you're also essentially saying is that while clubs at the top can make enormously expensive mistakes repeatedly and get away with it. Those who are trying to close the gap have to be perfect, and if they make a mistake in the process then they have to be punished. Thus returning them back to the drawing board. They didn't?  Maybe look up transfer fees before spouting nonsense. Coutinho is a fair critisism, but Buendia has just missed the entire season to an ACL injury and was playing really well in the preseason until that point under Emery, and Duran has a lot of potential, just needs some finesse.  If you want to critisise our signings since we came up, then Ings, Coutinho, and Wesley are the ones over 20 mil that are better examples. [deleted] Villa itself isn't sustainable.  Clubs should be sustainable, not needing owner funding to stay afloat  Yes it keeps smaller clubs down but if Tottenham can get to the big 6 without huge owner funding then so can villa Richest club in the world - £1b in debt. Very sustainable.  Aston Villa - Owned by a very rich man, big fanbase, history. All the things United have but one is allowed to spend, one isn’t. How do you think a club can becomes a Champions league mainstay from outside the big 6 with the current rules linked to revenue? Add to the fact that they have the 5th largest wage bill in the league. Noone defends the status quo as much as top six fans (that are not city/chelsea) At least be honest about  it.   ""Come up wioth a better alternative, or we get to keep our oligarchy""     I'd rather you lot fuck off to the super league like you wanted and wither away in that abomination. Rather than change PSR by itself I'd much rather money was put towards supporting every team rather than just focusing on the big 6.  Scrapping FA cup replays deprives smaller teams of income just so teams in Europe get an extra night off.   The changing of the CL format makes it harder for a smaller team to progress, and makes it far more likely we'll get the big teams in the final.  Instead of hoarding all the cash in the PL, actually send a decent amount down the pyramid. The fact clubs are spending more on wages than they take in revenue in the second tier of English football is ridiculous. I am aware this isn't a big 6 thing, every club suddenly decides they'd rather have the cash when they get promoted.   Clubs selling property the club owns to ""sister"" companies to get round PSR should be banned outright. As should giving stupidly long contacts to players. I was being sarcastic. Firstly, this was sarcasm. Secondly, rather than repeat myself, I refer you to my reply to another comment I made on this thread. That explains the issues I have. Spoiler- it's not FFP. How dare we not get given a stadium for free, right? but you're literally proving the point that the only way for smaller clubs to compete with top ones is to 'overspend', something which they get punished for doing. literally only the top clubs benefit from this, as they can spend more from the get go I mean if Villa are only allowed to spend £180m a season, and Man United are allowed to spend £550m a season thanks to FFP...   How can there ever be competition between the clubs?   Their owner is underwriting their spending. That is called investment and means it is within their means. And it should be allowed under FFP to allow clubs to compete and mean that football has upwards mobility... because the alternative is that only 6 clubs exist in any meaningful way in England, and the rest just live as their whipping boys to provide them 6 points and the odd player a season. They have next to 0 debt and achieved CL football Everton have a net spend of -£23m since 2019   Everton have a -£234m net spent since 2014  Everton have literally the best net spends of all PL teams that have been a consistent PL team for the last decade  Only teams like Brighton and Brentford have a better net spend  Bournemouth have outspent Everton for example How does masters boot taste? We haven’t overspent above our means our owners are worth 14 billion, we’ve overspent due to restrictions put in place by FFP but go off about Everton Exactly, people don't realise no rules would just be a race to the bottom, incredible mouthwatering sums would be wasted, and everything would just be owned by nation states. There has to be *something* in place, FFP/PSR aren't perfect but we can't even begin to make them better when owners like those of Villa/City want to kill it in the first place. I agree with you, but it's fanciful thinking. I have no hope that will ever happen. [deleted] Since 19/20 season you've spent 834 million on players and made 195 million in player sales and we're the ones selling our best players to keep above FFP. how can we compete with the big 6? Then the goal should be Debt Fair Play instead of FFP.    Each club can have at most 60% of its annual revenue as total debt.  Infrastructure debt is not counted.  Clubs spending over 100% of revenue need to put money into an escrow for future spending / salaries above that 100% threshold.  This does just as good a job as FFP at control ""club bankruptcy"" that UEFA is worry about.    Debt Fair Play is vastly superior to FFP at allowing club mobility.  Allowing ambitious owners to take their club to the top 4 etc... Spurs are a London team. Try doing that as Bolton. You really are pushing this angle, like your entire footballing part of your account is about this agenda. Dude, what the actual fuck, your entire account is basically spamming this ridiculous argument over and over again.   How have the downvotes and numerous comments that have replied to you not told you that this is genuinely just a stupid opinion? Where did they say red cartel?  Can you explain to me the logic of a system that allows Man U who finished 8th and are 773 million pounds in debt, to spend more than Villa who finished 4th and have 10mill debt?  Cheers there are several hundreds of professional clubs in Europe.  Only a few went bust, mostly due to high debt.  High debt is a huge issue and UEFA should tackle that (debt fair play) instead of limiting spending by rich ambitious billionaires. There is no need to exploit it if the owner is rich and willing to put money into the club as equity.  -owner put money into the club in the form of equity, use this cash to pay down the debt to 50% of annual revenue or 10% or 0%   -owner put money into the club in the form of equity, use this cash to spend on players in order   There is no need to fake sponsorship so you can increase revenue by an extra 40m so that your debt can increase by 20m.  You have the money and you want to spend.  Put that 40m into the club as equity.  Club have extra 40m to spend. [deleted] You are smoking crack if you want us to sell Luiz. I think it’s more that if your club is to compete with the oil clubs, you need to find a way to sell players for significant profits and having a bunch of broke clubs doesn’t really help Imo it's not ironic, it's just the world we live in... in football and even just in general. If you don't play the game you get left behind whether you are morally/ideologically in agreement or not. I'd argue that complaining about inflated prices but still squeezing every penny from the transfer market is the only logical and sane (albeit possibly counterintuitive) way of going about things, as in any environment in life you participate in but don't fully agree with.  It's like being aware of ""ethical consumption"" but still ending up buying carbon-fuelled cars from Toyota, petrol from Q8, water/drinks in plastic bottles, imported processed food from supermarkets, clothes from fast fashion chains etc (and I'm not even touching on boycotting for ethical reasons here)... for some it's near impossible to go without these things without a valid and obvious alternative, regardless of their moral stances. How is it ironic? Dont spend too much you break ffp, dont be so badly managed financially you become completely skint and lowballing transfer targets. Both are terrible Yep but that doesn't change what I've mentioned. I have no idea what the solution needs to be but it doesn't work right now. I don't think you watched us tbh. You don't finish 5,5,8 in the prem with wasting money like that.   The actual truth is we began expanding our squad for European football, that comes at a cost both in fees and also salary. A club of our size should be able to grow if they get European football consistently right?  No, we came 5th in 19/20, following a €15m net spend. Finished 5th again, following €5m net spend. Finished 8th following €63m net spend, then relegated following €32 net profit.  In total that adds up to €51m net spent over 4 seasons, aka something like 75% of a Naby Keita.    For reference, Liverpool spent more than 4x net fees in the same period with the ability to pay huge wages even when they don't get UCL. That's because of - shock - revenue that neither us or Villa have. Villa had more trophies (quite a bit more) than when Ferguson took over Man Utd as well [deleted] Depends what you mean. Looking at the user age of r/soccer from the past censuses, at least 80% of the sub is under 30. For the vast majority of people here Villa haven't been one of the biggest six clubs in England for their entire lifetimes No-one is competing with Man City period. They’ve got nation state wealth and cheat their tits off. Think Arsenal or Man Utd have done well the last decade, most years neither are in the champions league.   Really there is no country that protects big clubs less than the U.K.. Look at how other leagues distribute TV income or who they allow to own clubs. Here we had a bonfire of big clubs, welcomed in every corrupt despot going, and it’s still not enough, cos Villa went from Championship to Champions League in 5 years but now have to sell like one player.   I have literally no idea what anyone wants, but lthe only way to protect big clubs less would be to let nation states spend 20% of their GDP on players, and do you really want to watch Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and whatever nonsense country next rocks up here slug it out for the rest of time, cos I don’t.   Maybe if we’re lucky Israel can buy West Brom and Iran can buy Millwall then we can get some rivalries going again? This surely isn’t a future anyone can get into. So to keep it remotely watchable you need to limit owner spending. You may not like FFP but the alternative is we all need a new pastime. This model is fairest to the big clubs, the medium clubs and the small clubs.  Everyone have a chance.    Debt Fair play. This target debt, the main case of club bankruptcy. Limit each club debt to 60% of its annual revenue (infrastructure debt is not counted)  Escrow. For club who are spending more than 100% of annual revenue, then the part above the 100% will need to put into escrow in case the owner walk away.  This will allow for club mobility (GOOD). This prevent clubs going bust (GOOD). This put more money into the football ecosystem/pyramid (GOOD).  An ambitious owner of Fulham could spend and have a good shot at the Champions League spot and at the same time Fulham is protected from going bust. Arsenal went how many years out of the champions league and have been completely out of Europe, Man United just finished 8 and have missed out more than they’ve qualified for champions league in recent years.   If you think the league structure is fixed for big clubs in any way in the U.K. you should follow Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Scottish, Turkish basically any other countries football. England does *everything* to boost other clubs income and facilitate investment and competition. Some people just won’t be happy till Man Utd are relegated and even then folk will say “oh it’s just a conspiracy to keep big clubs out of League 1, how are Doncaster meant to compete with them!”. Chelsea? Their owner came out saying their books aren't clean during the roman era Chelsea have stated on record that during the Abramovich era they were paying players off book to manipulate FFP. Chelsea were the dominant side before Man City. Look at the history of the break away from the football league. Football didn’t start in 1992 Love how this is downvoted but its 100% correct lol Even if they start spending the same, the big clubs already have a massive head start like stadium, training ground, academy ... People failed to understand that to catch up either you have to spend more or the ones above you have to fuck up. Fairness is being the most successful over the last century and having more money to spend than the teams that have done nothing over the last century.   United, Arsenal and Liverpool are benefitting off more than 100 years of competence, as they should be. Newcastle, Villa, Chelsea and City are being pumped full of money that wasn’t earned through football, which shouldn’t be an option.   Sport should reward sporting success and nothing else. If you’ve won the title across 7 different decades (as all of the big 3 have), you should be able to financially bully clubs like Villa and Newcastle. That’s an earned advantage. It’s unearned advantages (like significant owner investment) that should be stamped out of the game. Spurs also have a massive advantage through being based in London and having access to that market though, it would be significantly harder for teams like Newcastle or Villa to do it that way because they simply don't have access to the same exploitable resources. Not to take away from what Spurs did, it's a massive achievement to get themselves into that position amongst the top 6 without financial doping, but let's not pretend that the Premier League is a level playing field for everyone to do the same. What are the facts? Yes and signing Raya would have put Arsenal in breach. I believe only Rice was the one that required almost total payment up front. All the others are split more evenly over multiple years.   Additionally while Arsenal can sign people without selling beforehand this season if they don't sell after making new acquisitions it will put them in breach. It's funny, because people just think that Liverpool have always been some behemoth, when in 2010 we were literally on the brink of administration. And I know better than most, because not only am I a member of Spirit of Shankly, I was in court every day when we RBS were forcing the sale to FSG who own us now. We were all sat in Costa Coffee across from Slaughter & May's offices in London (where John W. Henry was) waiting to hear that RBS and Wells and Fargo had got the £200m that was due that day and that would mean the sale had gone through.  Our club was a mess, they found all sorts of hidden debts they'd had no clue about when they bought us. They basically built us up from pretty much Square One. Although we had a big fanbase, basically everything had been mortgaged to the hilt or left to rot under our previous owners.  Thing is, I doubt most fans are happy to wait for the 8 years it took us to have a serious title challenge and that involved selling big fan-favourite players. They want it all tomorrow. You say that but I genuinely think some of the people complaining dont understand why they cant spend yet. FFP was originally introduced by Platini after the clubs asked him to save them from themselves. Leeds, Fiorentina, Parma and many more clubs sent themselves to the wall overspending to chase European football. What year would you introduce FFP? I wish they'd introduced it in the 90's but better late than never This. Where should their money come from? Man Utd have over 3 times the annual revenue of Villa What? This so small compared what they spent  601 vs 218  Just go look at their transfer history. From 18/19 season each season they have 100m+ spending spree. > Outside of Grealish, nobody else was trying to buy their starters.  That's fine, but that is also very much not anyone else's problem. The fact that you have no one worth buying is an indictment on the club, not the rest of the market.  > How can you balance the book when you're building a squad?  Brighton have done it. Tottenham have done it. Other clubs have done it too. Didn't realise they played for free. Honestly I don't really care exactly what those three players added up to. The wider point is they've spent a lot of money on a lot of mid players the last three years. Their three best players this year are arguably Watkins, Martinez, and Luiz who all signed 4-5 years ago. Funny how all the Newcastle fans come running in defence of Villa. Just say it's because you want your club to spend loads and we'll take your opinion more genuinely. 'actually we only wasted about 80m and a load on wages, not 100m' isn't the gotcha you might think Ridiculous buys? Haha Buendia and Duran are fine, Coutinho was a fuck up among many of Gerrard’s fuck ups. That's what's been happening in Europe for years, so yes. They are in Europe now, need to play by the same rules. Tottenham have a major advantage of being based in London and having a significant existing supporter base. Ultimately, there are many cities and clubs for whom something like that is just not achievable. Liverpool are 197 million in debt with a revenue of 594   Aston Villa are 10 mill in debt with a revenue of 218 million.  If this was about sustainability then Liverpool would be told to cut spending more than Villa would All it took was spurs receiving a world record transfer fee, and having a generational talent come through their academy as a boyhood spurs fan so he stayed through most of his prime. Easy. Why don't Villa just do the same, are they stupid?  Edit - really wound up the red cartel with this one 😂 people keep using spurs like it's some kind of sustainability flex when they are likely not just the exception to the rule, but even as good as they've been financially they don't even have any cl qualification over the last two years to show for it, let alone trophies Maybe the owner of Villa treat it as a start-up mentality.  Spend now. Establish itself as Top 4.  Generate a lot of revenue.  Now the club have a lot of revenue, they will be sustainable without needing any more ownership putting hundreds of millions more. £1bn in debt? That's about 18 months turnover for them. Doesn't matter if it's sustainable  You can't compare Villa to Man Utd, if you could they wouldn't need a very rich man to prop them up > How do you think a club can becomes a Champions league mainstay from outside the big 6 with the current rules linked to revenue?  The exact way Tottenham did it for years Again, please provide an alternative. PSR and FFP limit the big clubs as well as the small clubs. Without spending tied to revenue you’d have a far less competitive League than there currently is. You’d have City running away with the League year on year on year with Chelsea and Newcastle way behind in 2nd and 3rd. Big clubs are big. Arsenal, Liverpool, United etc. are all massive clubs. They should be able to sustainably spend more than their smaller rivals. Villa were in the Championship 5 years ago ffs.   And why should any team who gets bought out by some mega wealthy guy/consortium have the automatic right to just spend their way into a “Champions League mainstay” position? In the last 10/15 years the only true “Champions League mainstays” are truly anomalous dominant teams like Madrid, Barca, PSG, Bayern, Juventus, City etc. every other team rotates in and out. Teams can and should aspire to qualify for the CL, to try and push for trophies and titles of course. Leicester was a magical story. Villa getting CL will provide their fans with an amazing experience. Rennes played Champions League football this season. Smaller clubs can clearly compete and do well relatively frequently under the current system. But why should they have the right to outspend way beyond their stature and means as a club? What are your thoughts on Wrexham?  And you’re missing the point of there being a big big big track record of clubs spending far beyond their means and getting themselves in financial trouble You think clubs should break the rules ? If Villa manage to perform at the same level again this year, they’ll get CL revenue, won’t have to sell, and can continue to build a squad. >Scrapping FA cup replays deprives smaller teams of income just so teams in Europe get an extra night off.  Agreed. This is unfair to basically every team that isn’t competing in Europe. Poor move  >The changing of the CL format makes it harder for a smaller team to progress, and makes it far more likely we'll get the big teams in the final.  Let’s see a couple of seasons before we bin this off. But I imagine the current round of 16 will look similar to the new round of 16  >Clubs selling property the club owns to ""sister"" companies to get round PSR should be banned outright.  Agreed. And didn’t the clubs agree to look into this recently?  >As should giving stupidly long contacts to players.  Amortisation has been capped at 5 years I think so that’s already somewhat sorted The reason the current UCL format exists is because Perez said it’s either that or we break away and do the ESL I know. I’m just not sure I agree with the point you’re making with the sarcasm. I feel like Tottenham are the perfect counter-argument to that idea.  They had a shocking, perennially midtable side that never really did anything of note for years.  Then they developed an actual transfer strategy, a style of play, a proper manager and integrated their youth team and managed to expand the top four into the top six.  You don't have to ""overspend"", you have to spend correctly. That is not the only way at all, there's better smarter ways that don't put your club at a risk if the billionaire one day wakes up and decides to not put in money and you are fucked  There's much healthier and smarter ways to do it, it might take longer sure, look at the way Brightion have risen without any FFP issues or massive overspending A bit bad to pick Manchester United one of the most healthiest commercial giant clubs who got to where they are with shit owners even taking money from their club  FFP is not about ""fair"", football is not fair, it has never been fair and will never be fair   Not in Premier League, not in any league, disparities in everything not just in financial means will always exist I feel like people need to understand how genuinely useless net spend is as an actual figure.  It represents one small aspect of a transfer and fans suddenly think it shows financial prudence when it doesn't.  No one gives a fuck about your net spend.  How much have you spent on agents? (Probably a lot, given that you are, or at least were, in the pocket of Kia Joorabchian, who isn't known for working for free) How much have you spent on wages? What's your turnover? What commercial deals do you have?  Also, you're still on the hook for a lot of players and have even reported losses on players. You've bought some expensive players and then not made book value profits on them, forcing you to report them as losses. You've also cancelled some player's contracts, like Gylfi Sigurðsson, which I don't imagine he agreed to for no charge.  Net spend means absolutely fuck all. Isn't net spend like a tiny fraction of any clubs finances? How much have Everton spent on wages in that time? I understand being biased but holy shit this is just hilarious, net spend  Yeah only net spend matters lad m8, this is amazing football financial knowledge Yeah a swedish fan looking at Premier League ""small"" clubs who overspend and get 100m just for being in the league is licking the boot  Try real football complaints instead of complaining that you spend nearly 100% of your revenue just in wages and think that stuff is good and ""the big 6"" is evil You spend nearly 100% of your turnover on wages, that is astronomically bad and stupid  You are complaining here about unfairness yet you are doing something unfair, you are a huge fish to teams below you and doing the same thing just like the ""big 6"" are to you   You people sit here and complain and act like you have it tough in a league where you get 100m just for being there, have billionaire owners, you are not real football fans you want to have money so your team spends and spends and play FIFA in real life, if those owners decide to dip and fuck you over who will save you? Your owner being worth something doesn't guarantee any sort of security to the club. The club having the ability to produce most of that money itself does give that stability. What happens when your billionaire owners aren't willing to throw money at the club any more.  Would you be happy for your club to go out of business because you got into the CL a couple of times? I think we're already taking some steps with the anchoring being trialled. Football regulator coming in might be beneficial we'll see. I think the % cap on football expenditure will be a good thing in the long run.   I just don't like all the complaining that ""my clubs billionaire can't spend whatever he wants"" that's not a preferable outcome, it wouldn't make things more competitive. Thankfully unlimited spending won't ever happen again. UEFA sees that it's fucking bonkers. I mean... why would i be able to answer that?  Transfer spend isn't the only expenditure.  Wage bill, commercial deals, prize money, transfer spend, transfers in, ticket sales, merchandising sales, TV revenue, agents fees etc, these all make up the figure people talk about and countless others.  How much you spend on transfers really isn't the only part of the equation. You can’t. The reason he’s able to be so smug with that vapid argument is because his club benefits from the status quo. Nobody actually believes you're really this dense and don't know the answer.    But to humour you, if Egypt invades Israel and Nassef Sawiris gets sanctioned Villa could be fucked as they spend more than they make. Man Utd waste their own money. Do you want to check the annual revenues of Man Utd and Villa?  Cheers > Where did they say red cartel? >  >   Look at the comment history of the guy I replied to and you'll see that they've been implying for days now that everything happening to City and the other clubs being done by the rules they all agreed to, is one big conspiracy being orchestrated by the owners of Liverpool & United.  >Can you explain to me the logic of a system that allows Man U who finished 8th and are 773 million pounds in debt, to spend more than Villa who finished 4th and have 10mill debt?  Sure can.  Manchester United make far more money than Aston Villa do and that allows them to spend much more and put less of their total turnover on wages than Villa do (51% to 89%) even though United pay their players more than Villa.   Although with that being said I believe United are actually in a bit of FFP trouble themsleves and will need to sell players this Summer before they can bring in new additions to their squad. More than a few went bust, you only can think of a few. Carlos is vital to their defence. Even if they sell both cash and Duran, they won't get the fee for Luis alone. You wouldn't sell him despite him being poor and despite us potentially NEEDING to sell someone?  He's our most valuable asset while not being pivotal to how we play. Don't see a good argument against the sale tbh Not everyone can spend 60M on flops and be ok with it, the economic realities of the PL and all other top leagues are not comparable, to chock it up to ""financial mismanagement"" is a naive and reductionist POV.   In any case English clubs can just as well reject those offers and also reject to pay the fees requested by Italian clubs, nothing is forcing the two sides to do business. I think Villa are in a good position. They're been nothing but speculation that Villa need to sell. United and Chelsea are unlikely to have huge summer spending despite their revenues because they've spent badly and now are also hobnobbed with FFP. Liverpool are heading into a tricky transitional era and Spurs are Spurs. Even Arsenal are probably not gonna be able to do a Rice type transfer for a few summers. Only those City cheaters essentially have unrestricted funds because FFP is just a meme to them.  No reason why Villa, with their existing squad, and some smart addons to squad depth can establish themselves as a CL side - should be two CL spots up for grabs (assuming City and Arsenal don't fall off a cliff) every season and that'll considerably give them more revenues and greater FFP room. Perfectly put.  It shouldn't shock anyone that the gap in revenue between the top 6 Clubs has barely changed in at least a decade; Man Utd (£360m) made £210m more than Spurs (£150m) in 2012/13 and Man City (£700m) made £220m more than Arsenal (£480m) in 2022/23 - in fact as a % of revenue the top 6 are closer than they've been for a long, long time.  Meanwhile, the gap between 6th and 7th has **Quadrupled** from £50m in 2012/13 to £230m in 2022/23 - and it looks even worse when you consider that in 2012/13 that gap was a half of the revenue of the 7th richest club, while now it's **~90%** of the revenue of the team in 7th (Newcastle with a £250m Revenue).  I'm not arguing a conspiracy or anything, but when you get a team (Villa) that over the last 3 Years has a Transfer Net spend of £109m compared to the £192m that the team who finished a place higher (Liverpool) and the £304m of the team that finished a place below us (Spurs) **and** we're potentially going into a record breaking season for revenue for not just us as a team, but potentially going to be the first team outside the top 6 to make £300m+ in a single season and despite all that Villa are looking like they have to sell a top asset - it does seem like the rules *might* not promote competition and may in fact favour teams who could/did spend to build their brand and elevate their status before the Rules came into effect more than those who didn't. For me it’s the more recent stuff especially Gerard just giving instructions to kick our players.   Never disliked O’Leary much really. But maybe I have both a too long memory and a short one… Villa have always been in the 6 most successful clubs and had the top 6 most fans.  Also unless you're 13 you will have seen Villa in the top 6 People want the billionaire owners to be able to dump their personal money in No to defend the current financial situation because the rope has firmly been pulled up, but people will be able to compete with City once Pep is gone. Like look at their winning margins in the league, even with their financial doping:  2023/24: 2 points  22/23: 5 points  21/22: 1 point  20/21: 12 points  19/20: lost by 18 points  18/19: 1 point  17/18: 19 points  A couple of blowout years, but also four seasons where a single loss could have lost them the title. Losing Pep has to cost them at least a couple of results a season given how good he is, and that should be enough to stop them winning every year. >They’ve got nation state wealth and cheat their tits off.  So ffp is good, and city have cheated so take everything off them and what happens? The 3 most successful clubs in the country get more honours, ffp is clearly really keeping up competitiveness.....  >Think Arsenal or Man Utd have done well the last decade, most years neither are in the champions league.   And yet can still massively outspend the teams that beat them.to the spots, meaning less punishment for bigger teams making mistakes than smaller ones.  >I have literally no idea what anyone wants  A playing field that doesn't give the already top teams more opportunities to pull away, which ffp clearly is not. I don’t know why we have to pretend that this is some impossible problem. Just don’t allow the top clubs to spend offers of magnitude more money than everyone else because of ‘revenue’ - revenue for these clubs is just an indicator of past success, it’s a self fulfilling cycle. Have a spending cap, something.   Even FFP in its current iteration wouldn’t be an issue for the most part if the numbers rose in line with ‘football inflation’ - as it stands it’s obvious that the status quo can’t carry on, look at how many clubs have been stung trying to compete last season. It’s unprecedented. you're right. i appologize No, but the premier league did. It was division 1 of the football league in the 80s. What resources? The facts are that little boys and girls around the UK are getting up to turn off the TV when the PL comes on and telling their parents it's because ""FFP and PSR spending rules are forcing Aston Villa to balance the books before the new season, game's gone"" if bankruptcy is the fear then target debt, the main case of club bankruptcy.  Limit each club debt to 60% of its annual revenue (infrastructure debt not counted)  why target spending by rich owners who want to invest more money into the football ecosystem. from my memory the noises for it coming in were around the time chelsea were becoming a really good team, and maybe around the time city were getting their glow up too I would never introduce FFP.  FFP, which restrict spending on players when compare to a free market, might be violating EU/UK antitrust laws due to the lack of collective bargaining agreement with the player union that would have to agree to such restriction. I am surprised that no player has sued since he would have a very strong case.  I would introduce Debt Fair Play instead of FFP.  Cap debt at each club at 60% of its annual revenue.  Infrastructure debt is allowed.  Also require owners who spend beyond 100% of revenue to put money into an escrow in case he/she walk away. On the flip side, why should United have the ability to invest more than any other team based on the current rules? It shouldn't matter where the money comes from, just that everyone has equal opportunities. In a free market (aka before 2010 when FFP was introduced), money can come from the owner who believe that investing more money might result in much higher return a few years down the road. Exactly, they've been poor for over 10 years and can still invest in their team like they're regular winners, just because they rode the premier League wave early on.   That premier League growth of the 90s will never happen again, and ffp made sure to pull up the ladder for the rich teams. Before 2010 when FFP was introduced, it does not matter.  Ambitious owners can spend as much as they are willing in a free market.  Think of start-up mentality. And 77 times the debt Blackburn was a spending money thing, Leicester even was owned by one of the richest people in Thailand and the only reason they got relegated is COVID (King Power is a duty free airport shop) Is 218m making zero though? That’s my point Brighton are pretty happy to just exist in the premier league. Which is why their manager left.   Villa have owners who want to try and actually grow the club so it can compete for the biggest prizes. >Brighton have done it.   Have they? I don't think De Zerbi would agree. Jokes on you, they don't play at all! No, wait. Duran is a class young striker.  In the past 3 years we’ve signed great players like Torres, Kamara, Diaby, Tielemans, Bailey and Buendia. Not really relevant the quality of the players is it? Other clubs are allowed huge flops and it doesn't affect them I have no love for Villa, nor do I want unlimited spending for anyone. But what I wrote is a perfectly legitimate take. Unfortunately tribalism is more important than objectively I suppose. Not even gonna bother pointing out why you're wrong. At that point, you're arguing something no one can actually change. The FA and the Premier League can't bring in regulation to help with that. So you mean clubs with more fans will be successful?, that kind of sounds ok  Otherwise it's just whose oil state has the biggest oil piss stream Only we are objectively run sustainably, that debt is debt we regularly pay off through that revenue. Similar to Madrid who are also massively in debt but it's all essentially 'safe' debt due to their revenue and it being used for building stadiums and such  Villa pay off their debt through owner funding which is good for the club but bad for the league and isn't sustainable   If everyone was just allowed to use whatever owner money they get then we'd have a pissing contest between the two gulf states and nobody else Villa sold someone for a prem record fee did they not? They haven't quite got lucky with their own version of Kane but it's not like Tottenham just pulled it out of their arse. They've been gradually getting up there at around the same time as city in a fair way > All it took was spurs receiving a world record transfer fee, and have a generational talent come through their academy as a boyhood spurs fan so stayed through most of his prime.  Oh yeah, because its not like Aston Villa had Jack Grealish, who they then sold for £100m.  > Edit - really wound up the red cartel with this one 😂  Or just made a stupid point and didn't realise that you basically just described Aston Villa until after you posted. Why don't they sign and develop good players? Your guess is as good as mine. You can't use that mentality in a league with over a hundred years of history.  And clearly not sustainable if their wage/turnover ratio is 90%. They'd have enough for club costs I imagine but then nothing for transfer fees which then turns it into either a sell to buy model similar to us or just take on debt again Ah yes, 18 months is such a short amount of time to recoup a billion pounds. If United weren’t owner by rich people then they’d be struggling. Tottenham is in London which is a huge financial boon for them. They’ve done well mind, but that helps sooo much. > They should be able to sustainably spend more than their smaller rivals.  At least you are honest about the fact that you only support these rules because they benefit the top clubs.  >Smaller clubs can clearly compete and do well relatively frequently under the current system.  For one season, and then they have to sell their best players and go back to being a middle table again. Just have a league wide spending and wage cap and bollocks to everything else tbh. Fairer than what we have right now.   Clubs can decide the numbers themselves. Owners have to put aside a few years worth of running costs to guarantee survival of club should they pull out - achieves the same as ffp from a club survival perspective. Alternative:  Free market spending with:  Debt Fair play. This target debt, the main case of club bankruptcy. Limit each club debt to 60% of its annual revenue (infrastructure debt is not counted)  Escrow. For club who are spending more than 100% of annual revenue, then the part above the 100% will need to put into escrow in case the owner walk away.  This will allow for club mobility (GOOD).  This prevent clubs going bust (GOOD).  This put more money into the football ecosystem/pyramid (GOOD). No. But I don’t think it’s possible to do with the rules right now.  Each of big 6 revenue is more than double the next closest team in the league. They can out spend anyone else on transfers and wages over multiple seasons.  The teams spending the most will more than likely finish higher up the league (the big 6). The higher you finish the more revenue you get from CL qualification.  So basically no team from outside the big 6 will manage multiple CL qualifications. They will have to sell to their competitors to balance the books.  This will always be an issue while spending is tied to revenue. But that's exactly the point. If you're staying within the rules then there's no way for you to actually improve as a club. You'll have some good seasons, then get picked apart by bigger clubs that you have absolutely no way of competing with. >Agreed. And didn’t the clubs agree to look into this recently?  I think they didn't agree on the way it was worded. Whatever that means. We'll see what happens with that.  >Amortisation has been capped at 5 years I think so that’s already somewhat sorted  I had heard that, however Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign a 17 year old who'll sign a 7 year deal in 2025. So it seems there are ways around it. Just for clarity, I'm quite happy to see Villa in the CL and hope they do well. It'd be good to see a team out of the top 6 gain a foothold.  That being said I can't stand John Mcginn after he tried to cripple a 15 year old Archie Gray in a friendly. A) That analysis of Tottenham's history is kind of bollocks.   B) Tottenham are a London club, and consequently have far more 'pulling power' when it comes to attracting talent/overseas fans and investment. I think what tottenham have done is actually amazing, but at the end of the day last season they sold their best player to a legacy club and never win anything.   they will not be in the cl this season, and they can not take top 4 for granted. they did well to reach 5th, but you've also got to bare in mind that city, chelsea and newcaslte had bad seasons which played  a large part in this.   you say that this is the perfect counter argument to my idea but it's actually the perfect example of what I'm saying; they've made some great organic growth and still have fuck all to show for it. no trophies and not even in the cl, only finished 3 points above a chelsea that were a meme team up until the final third of the season.   it'd take a miracle for them to win the pl or cl soon, and an even bigger one for them to regularly compete for it too Brighton owe hundreds of millions to Tony Bloom, they might not spend loads on transfers but to a large extent they also owe their success to being bought by a billionaire Brighton are going nowhere. They’ve hit the glass ceiling. Something Newcastle and Aston Villa are finding out now. With FFP those top 6 places are effectively locked in.  The problem with clubs like Brighton who run the “right way” is that they have to get it right every year while a single bad season can see them out of the division. United have been absolutely rubbish for a decade now but their sheer wealth and FFP have insulated them any real effect. > look at the way Brightion have risen  Have they, though? Without our point deductions, we'd have the same amount of points as them. a situation where the money essentially just dries up all of a sudden can happen to club, like which football club owner is pulling out their investments just because they woke up on the wrong side of the bed?   also, which clubs have managed to organically grow and often be title and cl favourites or dark horses for at least a decade? the answer is 0, the only clubs that have come up and managed to not have to sell all of their players are chelsea and city Debt Fair Play instead of Financial Fair Play  Clubs can spend as much as their owners want in a free market as long as they have low debt (maximum debt is cap at 60% of annual revenue so a club with 400m in revenue can have at most 240m in debt....infrastructure debt does not count). Owners also need to put money into an escrow for future spending to cover future salaries / transfer fees paid in case they walk away.  The benefit of Debt Fair Play / Escrow is that it allow for mobility. For challengers to emerge. It also protect clubs from high debt which is usually the main driver for club bankruptcy. Man United got where they are because of Fergie's work pre-glazers which made them a commercial juggernaut.   And the point is they can't ever be matched if clubs aren't allowed to invest.   Either you need a fixed spending cap closer to Villa's spending than Man U's OR you need to allow investment. Otherwise what is the point of football if fans can't dream that one day their club could win the whole fucking thing?  Otherwise just because you had historical success, you are what? Forever entitled to success? Even if you are badly run like Man U are? >one of the most healthiest commercial giant club  Man United are in £1 billion worth of debt, that is not healthy in any world Our wages were high, they've dropped significantly in the last few years   Our wage bill is roughly the same as Crystal Palace, with 2 of our highest earners in Dele and Gomes leaving this summer and with expected sales that will come down again You said we spent way above our means, which is false  Everton's punishment came from losses made due to loans taken out to fund the stadium build and the interest rates of those loans You can either enlighten us why net spend is not an appropriate metric for showing FFPs restrictions on spending or be a prat about it. Guess you chose to be a prat If you genuinely believe the big 6 haven’t made this whole FFP a farce then no point even talking to you about it cause you know fuck all Yh and by spending that we achieved a top 4 finish and will be playing champions league football which will then increase our revenue. How can you grow a team/business without investment? Are you surprised spending money benefits a club? Takes time, investment and success on the pitch to set up those revenue streams. Impossible to do if you immediately get hamstrung when you try. It can definitely improve, but I think we've already reached the event horizon in terms of the possibility of a non big 6 team winning the league within the next few decades Easy solution. Either cap the living fuck out of wages/transfers, or essentially 'nationalise' the league so all income goes in to one pot which is then split evenly across the clubs. How is it Villas fault that they are following the rules on owner investment? Again following the rules the prem put out they are debt free.  There’s no way you can spin these rules any way but it favouring the established elite to a ridiculous and unfair degree. The intention of that is a completely different discussion Some people can't understand that Manchester United(expects fiscal 2024 revenue of 635-665 million pounds) have almost triple revenues the Aston Villa(£217.7m) have. Manchester United 51% wages to turn over ratio, Aston Villa had 89% with £120m financial loss in May of 2023 and they think that's healthy and completely normal. Sure thing. Statista puts Man U revenue at 824 for 2023. This means their debt is 94% of annual revenue   Villa has a revenue of 169 which means debt makes up 6% of yearly revenue.  Can you tell me what kind of sustainability system allows a team with 94% debt to revenue spend considerably more than a CL team with 6%?  Cheers Fair enough. Apologies for being snarky then I (ironically) thought you were jumping to conclusions [deleted] Carlos is 3rd choice, hardly vital. Konsa and Pau are much better than him. I wouldn’t be surprised if Mings becomes 3rd choice next year. A few English League fans think we all get 150 million per season just by existing too > can just as well reject those offers  Hence my initial comment, dont waste time with these clubs? There is a huge reason why Villa won't establish themselves though. Their revenue is basically the same as ours if they don't get into Europe. People seem to think they're going to regularly get into the top 4 - the only team that does that is City.   One injury crisis is all it takes for a bad season, they finish 8th and they're in trouble. Planning, smart signings, good manager - none of it matters when it's such a delicate balance for a club without big revenue. They haven't ""always"" been in the most successful six clubs though. In the PL era (since it's easy to get stats for and goes back to before the vast majority of people here were born) they're only 9th in terms of points. Since they last won a trophy (the League Cup in 1996) 13 different clubs have won trophies ahead of them, and the vast majority of the last decade has been spent either in PL relegation battles or in the Championship.  There's an argument that over the entire history of English football they're one of the biggest six clubs, but that's mainly because they were the dominant side in the late 1800s early 1900s (where they won 11 First Divisions and FA Cups), but looking at when people on here would realistically have been watching them, they're not one of the biggest six clubs in that time. The billionaire owners won’t get anywhere though, relative wealth is what matters and billionaires are broke compared to petrostates. Doesn’t matter if your owner has £7.4bn if you’re up against Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia and whoever the fuck follows once it’s a free for all, cos frankly that billionaire is skint relatively. All that happens is hyper-inflation occurs again and a mid-table sides best player now gets bought for £250m. Unless you are a football agent or a fan of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, this will suck. And you think the next guy is gonna be a schmuck? Or that there won’t be an ocean of money made available to cover for him going? The squad is still the squad, there’s key leaders across the team in their prime, I wouldn’t get excited. They might miss out one year, but after next year it will be 7 in 8, and then even if they miss one it’ll be 8 in 10 and off and running again.   Unless they lost over 115 and are severely punished (aka relegation), the league has been Scotland-ised. Never, ever should we as a nation have countenanced nation state ownership. If our own government tried to buy a team anywhere for the nation the idea would be laughed out of existence, why we let others is befuddling. Man Utd finished 8th this year. In what world are they pulling away lol. Check out how big clubs regularly do in any other league if you want to see what a problem set up looks like! We crippled big clubs strategic position in England, turned any side who get promotion into one of the richest in Europe by default and invited in an array of legit bond villains as owners and it still wasn’t enough. Can we just give Villa a replica trophy for participating, would that work? Look at how many clubs have been “stung” trying to compete, please! What percentage of revenue do you think a healthy business should be spending on wages? Cos Leicester were over 100% the season they go relegated, just wages, there’s still the rest of the football club to operate. Nottingham Forest were something like 94%, Villa 90%.   This is precisely what FFP was brought it to deter, cos those clubs need huge amounts of success to make those numbers not highly dangerous, whereas clubs like Fulham and Crystal Palace who are remotely sensible face a pressure to copy or lose out.   Football can’t run with everyone having total expense bill of 150% of turnover, cos some clubs are relegated every season. If you are 150% of turnover whilst in the PL, relegation decimates a club. Revenue matters at the lower end cos clubs do have to pay their bills, contracts run for years, and this collection of bond villian owners aren’t all good guys, whilst at the upper end nation states will end competition.   Something about your flair says you don’t really care about competition and would be delighted to see football reduced to a dick swinging contest between theocratic homophobic slave states though. What? The first games were played in 1992 but it was a long and complicated history leading up to that One of the busiest cities in the world, access to a market of people who on average out earn their contemporaries across the whole country and one of the most visited cities in the world. No matter what Newcastle and Birmingham do, none of their teams will ever have access to anything like that. Again, this isn't me disparaging Tottenham, the club is run incredibly well, but there isn't a team outside of London that could break into that big 6 market without serious outside investment. Then you can throw city 115 charges out of the window and let them spend billions every single season if they want to.   Is this what you want? Exactly. The idea that it's about sustainability when (eg) Villa owners would happily pump money in is daft.  It's solely about competitiveness. Because what happens when revenue you falls after the ownership changes and the debt levels massively increase against revenue?   And the contracts for players can't be paid? It was introduced 10 years after abramovich took over Chelsea. Trying to increase competitiveness by relaxing the rules about spending seems like the absolute worst way to even the playing field, though. If the current system is unfair, then that is just unbelievably worse, like to the point where I could actively see clubs shutting down and not even bothering any more. Which was sort of fine when billionaires were the owners. But when countries started buying teams, it became untenable, because absolutely nobody would ever compete with it. City don't want competition, they want to destroy any competition and win absolutely everything, every year until the end of time. Did you like the direction that was heading? If it stops clubs from going to the wall because of irresponsible owners then so be it. Rather have a shite team than no team at all Vast majority of start ups go bust. Not a model to aspire to The debt doesn’t really matter so long as it’s being serviced at reasonable rates which it seems to be. Lol no we're not. Bloom and Barber have both said we want to push on to being regulars in Europe.   De Zerbi left because the way they want to achieve that is different. Brighton definitely have done it.  De Zerbi just didn't want to deal with that model though. He wanted the Villa route. The Leicester route. Overspend on players fees and wages and hope that they can sustain a few years in the CL spots to make up for the amount of trouble they'll be in if they don't rely on that revenue uptick.  Brighton and Bloom don't want to risk that though. They'd rather keep making that revenue, spending within their means so that they're never in a position where they have to worry where the money's coming from. It's very funny how suddenly Newcastle fans are getting criticised for being pro villa when our fanbases spent nearly a decade actively disliking each other after you lot went down before.   People just wanna chuck their unresearched takes out and claim it's just them being objective lol  No I know. I'm not really arguing it, but just pointing out why Spurs doing it doesn't make it achievable for other clubs. It's more a sad indictment of the political landscape and failure to properly invest in cities, but that's not for here. Well my point is more that London is a significantly more marketable city than somewhere like Leicester or Bournemouth. That will give them an inherent advantage over clubs from places like Leicester and Bournemouth, for example.   Large fan bases are a completely justifiable reason, but that's not my point. Well the point is Spurs needed two huge scoops of luck to ""bridge"" the gap and even then they are not on a level with the other top 5, really.   What have they won? Nowt. As it stands it is not actually possible for any club to grow over any period of time to overtake even one of Man City, Liverpool, Man Utd, Arsenal, Chelsea. The deck is stacked, the ""elite"" clubs are set in stone with no more room at the top and that is a system that shouldn't be allowed. You just like it because your club benefits and is arrogant enough to think you somehow deserve to be unchallenged at the top forevermore.   (and for the record before you go on a ""what about Saudi bloody money"" rant, I do not think a system where immoral states can pump clubs full of oil money is acceptable either. But that doesn't make the current one fit for purpose either.) [deleted] £1bn is their turnover in 18months, it has nothing to do with their owners, who I believe don't put any money into the club Big clubs will always be big clubs. They will always be able to spend. But the current rules actually don’t benefit them. They’d be able to spend way more if we didn’t have PSR. PSR/FFP does not benefit my club right now. And tell me why should Newcastle, a club that was playing Championship football like 6/7 years ago be able to spend more than Liverpool, United, Arsenal etc. just because they got bought by a sovereign wealth fund?  Clubs like West Ham have consistently qualified for Europe over the last few years with their only major sale being Declan Rice (who they didn’t really have to sell and they got fucking £100m+ for him) and with that money they went out and spent hundreds of millions on Kudus, Paqueta, Alvarez, JWP, Aguerd and Scamacca PFA exist and a wage cap is big no. Congratulations, you just cemented City’s dominance for as long as UAE can be bothered to own City How did spurs manage to become big 6 as levy didn’t pump huge amounts of money into them and they didn’t break ffp regulations ?   Utd and chelsea were battling with Brighton and Newcastle for the majority of the season so for league positions.  Clubs need to invest wisely in players , the rule was a collective voted and agreed regulations as they are part of the premier leagues. If villa or Newcastle fans are getting angry about being part of a collective rule and want to spend their owners money independent from the league why don’t they propose tv rights be done by clubs rather then a premier league collective and each clubs can get their broadcasting rights from tv companies independently. Then you’ll see a big difference with the “big 6” spending. But they would never do that as they want a share of the pie, having a share of the pie comes with rules every club needs to abide by unfortunately… There have been many clubs which hve improved by staying within the rules. Albeit it ohhh be harder but villa spunking away  money on Ings and countinho has led them here.   Arsenal didn’t break the rules when they had emirates debt and had to sella star player every year for like 7 years. When they were being raided by city, no one was complaint about ffp and it’s not fair.  Same with Brighton.  Evryone raids everyone, you have to invest wisely and smartly and tie down your players on massive contracts like what villa did with Grealish Chelsea may have signed him to a 7 year contract but it can only be amortised for 5 years (I think) so it costs the same to Chelsea over 5 years as a 5 year contract would, removing one of the key benefits that Chelsea saw with those silly contracts > B) Tottenham are a London club, and consequently have far more 'pulling power' when it comes to attracting talent/overseas fans and investment. >    That's why Crystal Palace, West Ham, Brentford, QPR and Millwall are all just inches way for being a ""top 6"" team. > I think what tottenham have done is actually amazing, but at the end of the day last season they sold their best player to a legacy club and never win anything.  That isn't the argument, though.  The argument was how can Aston Villa compete with the top six. It was a top four before, now its a top six, largely because of Tottenham and their work.  Tottenham's refusal to take the next steps that would make them an actual title-winning side isn't part of the discussion.   Tottenham have it all in their power to go out and spend the money that lots of other clubs spend, especially since all their journalists spam puff-pieces about how sensible Levy's financial management is and how they're the only club to not have PSR or FFP troubles, but the reality is, Tottenham choose not to take that step, they're aren't forced to. Obviously, but that billionaire did not go in and overspend to get the success, it took time and smart decisions  There's clubs that have that debt + overspend like idiots simply because the owners are rich united were rich before saf, and were breaking transfer fees before he made a proper name for himself The solution is for owners to put their own liquid assets as immediately seizable collateral to make sure the club survives if they suddenly decides to fuck off and leave the club in financial shambles but there isn’t one owner in the PL who’s gonna agree to that… this is why you can’t allow clubs to spend beyond their own commercial income regardless of their owners’ wealth. The red “cartel” of United, Liverpool and Arsenal who have been championing Project Big Picture and the Super League are major supporters and originators of the current version of FFP. They prefer the status quo because they know the inherent advantage they have. They all have american owners that have NBA, NHL or MLB teams that rake in billions and are safe assets because they can’t be relegated and want the PL to operate the same way. Hence their frustration with City and Chelsea because they force them to invest more to stay competitive. Well you gotta take steps to achieve that big club freedom, not trying to take a shortcut for it. You keep showing your amazing football financial prowess with your replies, keep it up Palace's wages are £130m in the latest accounts whilst Everton's were £159m so I wouldn't say £29m is that roughly similar because it's still a significant amount of money. It's the difference between a 92% wage to turnover rate compared to 77% for Palace which is still high.   Everton are going in the right direction 100% but net spend is a really limited way to look at a clubs finances. Spending is not only about transfers you absolute genius, it's everything related to the football club including those loans  Go look at how healthy your wages are and come back ""net spend"" (which doesnt exist as relevant figure) isnt how you spent above your means, your wages are. Of course bro the mighty  big 6 is out to get you Are you even reading you genius  Yes you made it this year, how about the other clubs that don't make it and do this and then fail, then their owners don't spend and you are stuck in an awful situation   There's thousands of clubs that are protected from that because owners come in, play with their shiny toy then leave and you get fucked   I can't believe i have to tell this to fucking english football fans who see their clubs go under so many times Go back in time and you could see the same argument made by the Super Malaga team fans Let's be real though, you haven't gotten there through smart planning and transfers, you've got there because Tottenham, Chelsea, United and Newcastle all had major off seasons, and the fact that Unai Emery is an absolutely incredible manager that got your team to the position they're in.  That's not taking anything away from you, but let's not pretend that years of majorly over-spending on shite players is being vindicated. If Leicester can do it someone else can.    I look around Europe and it's no different anywhere else football allows monopolies and duopolies to form because of its nature and that's why we need stronger regulations.   People hate it but we can learn a bit off the MLS i think int need of caping spending and revenue distribution. It's insane the levels of disconnect. Don't get me wrong as an arsenal fan I hate United. But they are by far the biggest club in England. It isn't even a competition. They have been managed like shit for two decades with only ferguson to paper over the cracks. If they sorted themselves out and got new owners they would be dominant as fuck in England and would just be able to outspend everybody comfortably. It's because how much you can spend isn't based on its debt, but rather its revenue.  Villa spend 89% of their revenue on wages, Man Utd spend 51% of their revenue on wages. No problem, you weren't to know. I’d much prefer this option to selling dougie. Maybe the board know they can’t get all 3 done before the deadline for FFP. Sad times. Konsa? They struggled with him at the end of last season.  Also unless someone like Bournemouth decides to bail them out, 30 million for Duran is unrealistic. Why don’t you have a bit of respect for Italian football. 4 world cups, 2 euros to your measly little one World Cup Isn't that a good thing for the league, having different teams with a chance of getting into Europe? Being an established team seems to mean outspending other teams so you always get the same ones at the top Right but Villa have always been in the 6 most successful clubs. Villa have always been in the 6 clubs that have won the most trophies.   I'm not sure most points gained in the last 5 years is a good barometer of success as you can be second in that and not win anything.  What is the argument that Villa aren't in the 6 biggest clubs right now? In terms of fans and trophies Villa are so maybe revenue (where Villa are 7th)? But does size of club come down to revenue? No one’s bought a player above what Qatar bought Neymar for since then and they’ve had ample time to do so, I don’t think that Man City is going to suddenly actually spend that amount of money on a singular player just because the rules are gone.  Over a whole summer window I believe it, but not for an individual player You're an idiot and a rascist They'll get the next best person available, sure, but that person won't be as good at winning league titles as Pep because he's literally the most effective manager in the history of top level European football at it. I mean look at the manager merry-go-round at PSG who are similarly cheating the system. Just having money doesn't guarantee a successful manager. Also we've seen with sides like PSG, Chelsea, and United who have a combined net spend on transfers of nearly **four billion euros** since the 10/11 season, just spending a boatload of money doesn't necessarily build you a world class side. KDB has already spoken about going to Saudi Arabia for a big pay day, and it's likely they'll lose several key players in the year or two after Pep leaves as the players look for new challenges.  They're obviously not going anywhere and will still be at the top of world football, but even if they escape any punishment for their fraud, I'd be surprised if they won the league more often than 50% of the time after Pep leaves. I think the entire point of his comment is their dominance over the last 8 years wouldn’t have happened if United wasn’t ran by shitty bankers or if Arsenal’s players weren’t serial bottle jobs Just to be clear, you're arguing that because man united outspend everyone over a decade, and are so badly mismanaged that they don't progress in that time, that shows the bigger clubs aren't protected? Because if that's the argument you're making then you're saying money spent has no impact on league position, which would mean teams breaking rules wouldn't matter right, because it doesn't give them an advantage? You can protect someone and they can still collapse, it's just a lot harder, and still doesn't mean anything. What do you think the odds are that Villa will win a title before United? I’d be totally fine with continuing on the way we are currently, I just don’t think that the top clubs should be able to do whatever they want financially simply because of historical success. Shit for teams like Newcastle/Villa who push on a bit and then potentially lose their prime talents because they can’t then take that next step.   It’s not some sort of crazy statement to make. You could quite easily just put a blanket cap on transfer fees and wages and call it a day.   Let’s not pretend like most of those clubs aren’t where they are because of owner investment at some point in their history anyway. They just did it before anyone gave a shit. I don't see how London being busy is an advantage to London clubs. There are plenty of London clubs that are doing worse than Newcastle, and even Birmingham. Newcastle basically have no competition for miles. No we just want financial rules that don't punish non legacy clubs from being able to compete with any sort of consistency. I think that’s a very good argument. Especially if the 115 charges actually amount to anything… But being completely reliant on owner funding is what's unsustainable, and what they're trying to prevent.  If your revenue is artificially inflated by a sugar daddy owner, you're fucked the minute they get bored. You can't pay your players' wages or stadium maintenance based on legitimate revenue so the club faces liquidation.   We have literally seen it happen. The point is that Villa’s owners would happily pump money in … until they don’t Being reliant on owner funding isn't sustainable. What happens when their owners decide they want to take their money back out? You can’t talk about knowing they won’t or whatever, but unless you can codify that in a way that splits the good owners from the bad ones we’re stuck with ffp. It’s precisely because it’s difficult to know definitively what owners will do that we have to have this. Didn’t the Everton owner spend a stack of money then decide he was fucking off and now the club is walking a tightrope to sustain itself? That’s why people have been saying if that’s what you care about, make the owners put the money in escrow so the money’s already there yes but it was heavily talked about before it came into effect, which is the case for most major rules that was in 2003 when Abramovich took over Chelsea.  FFP was introduced in 2009.  So 6 years later. There's 2 options, either tighten the rules so everyone spends a smaller amount, or open it up so a smaller team can spend as much as a top team.   To keep the premier league competitive on a global scale, the latter is much better that is why I mentioned 2 safeguards.  Free market spending is allowed if:  1. Debt Fair play. This target debt, the main case of club bankruptcy. Limit each club debt to 60% of its annual revenue (infrastructure debt not counted)  2. Escrow.  For club who are spending more than 100% of annual revenue, then the part above the 100% will need to put into escrow in case the owner walk away. Yes, I loved the Blackburn story of overcoming Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool & Leeds dominance. It was a wonderful story of a club bank rolled to promotion and then winning the PL. So how does a team become competitive for the league? Yes it might save clubs, but it also stunts competition. you can stop the club from going bust with a better system that allow for club mobility.  1.  Debt Fair play.  This target debt, the main case of club bankruptcy. Limit each club debt to 60% of its annual revenue (infrastructure debt not counted)  2.  For club who are spending more than 100% of annual revenue, then the part above the 100% will need to put into escrow in case the owner walk away.  This way, rich and ambitious owners who want to invest more money into the football ecosystem can actually do so.  Free market if you will. Then limit debt as 60% of a club total revenue (infrastructure debt not counting).  The owners can ""start-up mentality"" if he can afford it by putting his money into the club in the form of equity instead of saddling the clubs with debt. Be that as it may, I don’t think it’s crazy to say Villa is clearly in a healthier and more liquid position They may say that but there actions don't show that. Fair, I just asked that because we would have finished the season with the same amount of points as Brighton if it wasn’t for our point deductions.  If they think they can improve whilst hardly spending any money, that’s fine. I will be impressed if they actually progress using that model, though. The current one is fit for purpose except for city and Chelsea who were jumped up thanks to huge amounts of owner funding  The current one (,even now) rewards being successful. Why should you reward teams that either didn't capitalise on their success or were as successful? Do you want to restart the leagues and ignore the past 130 odd years of league football? Do you want some kind of shit system without promotion and relegation where everyone gets the same money?   Yes you need consistent years of being successful, but that's always been the case. Just now you have owners that can spend billions of pounds and not worry about the consequences while 99% of teams can't. Why should they just be successful because they have rich owners? They didn't earn it over time. It's the equivalent of giving a kid a trust fund and making them compete with an average person   Spurs mismanagement in winning a trophy aside, they did get their fairly, and they'd be more successful if the league was harsher on clubs like city and Chelsea earlier as they did it organically Every club should have the right to spend 75m on Ings, Dendoncker, Coutinho, and Zaniolo without consequence imo. No matter how much money they earn. Sutton United should get to do it if they want. Everything you’ve said has proven my point. It benefits our clubs because the clubs below us can’t spend to get above us Spurs did it before there wasn’t 6 teams so far ahead.  Like spurs are now spending £150m a season. Arsenal at that time were paying off their stadium, in 2024 they are spending £200m a season. Arsenal? 13 times league winners Arsenal? Consistent CL competitors pre-FFP Arsenal? Yeah I bet they found it very hard to break into the top 6 they were *already part of*.   The entire point is that it's impossible for a team who doesn't already have the means to compete to gain the means to compete.   Anyone currently outside the top 6 is stuck there and that's by design. Ings and Coutinho cost £37m combined.  Is that all it takes to get here? I see, I didn't know that. Thanks for explaining. It's certainly a helping hand in Crystal Palace, West Ham and Brentford even being established in the Premier League. Lots of players want to live in London. It's much more attractive, and lucrative, than playing for northern teams in most cases. no one really tied the argument down to just the top 4, just talking about how ffp effects smaller clubs competing with the bigger oens   you still only have one team as an example, which plays a part in how difficult it is for other clubs to do. you have also picked a london club, with london teams having an advantage as most people will pick living in london over a lot of other cities in the world, let a lone the country   you've also got to bare in mind spurs just lost one of their best players of all time who's played a large part in their success, and managed to keep hold of another world class legend for a ridiculously long time. normally son and kane would have left spurs a lot earlier.    you've also got to bare in mind that unfortunately trying to do things long term in football can seriously back fire in football due to how important the short term victories are; teams not spending enough can see them consistently finish too low to attract good players, which means they have to make more risky transfers, which means they waste more and more money. they could even end up getting relegated.   like it is really amazing what spurs have done, but there's a reason as to why so few clubs have managed to pull it off as it's really difficult.   wenger essentially tried to do a similar thing, and it basically backfired because we won fuck all in the long run, and the ffp rules which we had been preparing ourselves for didn't really do much for us. I wouldn't say no owner would agree to put some money into an escrow in case they walk away.  As long as they can spend as much as they deem necessary in a free market.  Chelsea owners, Man City owners, Aston Villa owners, Nottingham Forest owners would do that imo.  FFP is a restriction for them.  Not a plus.  Debt saddled onto the club is the key.  Target that.  Cap debt (infrastructure debt is okay). united were born from outside investors reviving newton heath after they folded in the 1800s   united were a very rich club before fergies success   spending fuckloads in order to win has always been a part of the game, and even with that aside, due to the nature of sports success is very compounding. some players would rather player for madrid than get paid a trillion dollars to go elsewhere due to their history, but for others the only reason they'd pick another club over a top is for megabucks   you've then you've got to bare in mind players will get megabucks at top clubs anyway, so smaller clubs have to pay megamegabucks to have a sniff unless the player want guaranteed playtime. Good rebuttal that mate  Properly insightful >It's the difference between a 92% wage to turnover rate  That's still below the threshold though isn't it, yeah it's high, but it's still below the threshold   >Everton are going in the right direction 100% but net spend is a really limited way to look at a clubs finances.  But if you remove the stadium build, Everton have ran within their means, it's been at the top end for sure, but still within their means Everton's weekly wages  £1.5m per week  We're literally slap bang in the middle for PL wages Our wages are £1.5m per week  The wage bill of Crystal Palace per week is £1.4m  Everton's revenue is £180m a season   Crystal Palace is £160m a season  So in reality, we are within our means and have been for a few years now, the cost cutting has been underway since 2020 >Let's be real though, you haven't gotten there through smart planning and transfers  >the fact that Unai Emery is an absolutely incredible manager  Is this not part of what smart planning involves? Getting a good manager.  >let's not pretend that years of majorly over-spending on shite players is being vindicated.  What years of spending on shite players. This is such an r/soccer myth. Coutinho fair enough. After that there hasn't really been many duds. Dendoncker too I suppose.   Watkins and Martinez were good money for good players. Pau, Konsa and Bailey (eventually) too. Diaby still needs to prove his worth, but is definitely not ""shite"".  A notoriously cheap to assemble midfield 4 in McGinn, Luiz, Kamara and Tielemans. Cash worth every penny he cost.  Digne is on high wages, but has been key to this season, Carlos too. Moreno relatively cheap for the impact he's had. Duran looking like a good flip if he goes this summer.  High wages on a couple of emergency loans (Lenglet and Zaniolo) as a result of losing Mings and Buendia for the season.  Rogers cost £8m-15m.  We've used the youth academy well. We've also signed promising youth from other academies. Ramsey now a full first team player who was knocking on the England door before his injuries. Chukwuemeka, Archer, Philogene, A. Ramsey sold for decent money with buybacks included for some of them.  I guess if you go back further Ings wasn't a great signing but not terrible and sold for good money. There were a few misses when we got promoted and had to build an entire squad, true. We also sold a homegrown player for £100m in that time.  So to summarise. Coutinho, Dendoncker, Digne and a couple of emergency loans are the only bad spending in the last couple of years. And most of them were vital to this season. It's been almost a decade since we won it, though, and nobody has even come close.  It's not, you're right. It's a sorry state of affairs everywhere. And this is fine with you? Biggest revenues equals dominant as fuck. What a way to destroy interest in a league I know it’s revenue but I’m saying the fact it is ridiculous.   Your second point is fair and wage bill to revenue and I don’t really have an issue with that being considered as part of an FFP consideration Cheers, all the best Struggled with Konsa? Carlos vital to our defence? Don’t think you’ll find many Villa fans that agree with either of those statements Which broke ass italian clubs won these? I'm not sure I follow. Everybody has the capacity to spend more and put themselves at risk. Only a handful can do it within reason, the rest just have to suck it up regardless of intention or ownership security. Again, for the third time, you're dogmatically saying the only measure of ""most successful"" is total trophies which is important in some ways, but also pretty useless as a measure of how big/successful a club is at any given point in time. By that logic, clubs like Sheffield Wednesday and Blackburn Rovers are bigger than Leicester, and clubs like Fulham, Palace, and Brighton who have never won anything are on the same level as non-league clubs and behind relative powerhouses like Old Etonians, Wanderers (not Bolton Wanderers, the London club from the 19th century who never had a home stadium but still won five FA Cups), and Oxford University.   >I'm not sure most points gained in the last 5 years is a good barometer of success as you can be second in that and not win anything.  I'm not sure total trophies is a good barometer of success when we're talking about a club that won nearly half of their trophies over a century ago.  >What is the argument that Villa aren't in the 6 biggest clubs right now? In terms of fans and trophies Villa are  By what measure are they top six in terms of fans? They're 8th by average attendance in the PL and by[ social media followers](https://www.olbg.com/blogs/social-football-league), and 10th by [shirt sales](https://sportsjournal.io/premier-league-clubs-retail-merchandise-apparel-product-licensing-revenue-data-2022-23/). Again, they are only in the top six for trophies if you give equal weighting to trophies won 100+ years ago to now. They won’t have a choice. They will be a nation state buying players from billionaires. With no regulations prices will balloon. Saudi Arabia will dump oceans of money on their team. Nation states budget is whatever their rivals budget is x200%. Billionaire make a play, theirs will just inflate.   Taking away spending regulation will end any hope for all non-nation state clubs. City won 7 of 8 titles with nominal spending restrictions, without? good luck Villa, hope their owner winds up being king of a small oil rich nation otherwise they will have even less chance of competing than they do now. If there was any chance at all that Norway’s sovereign wealth fund was about to buy Scarborough to as a sportswashing project that would be just as shit. This is nothing to do with race. It’s not because of historical success, it’s cos of revenue generation. The more you do well the more you get. Is it unfair that Doncaster can’t compete with Newcastle, not really. You guys went from relegation fodder to Champions League in a couple seasons, thanks to one of the biggest human rights abusing nations on the planet taking you on, and somehow it’s not enough? Preposterousness of complaint aside, how is that not progress? Villa went from Championship to Champions League in 5 years? How is that not progress?   If you want to see a system that bakes in success, looks at what happens to TV revenue everywhere else. New and growing PL sides don’t know they’re born with what they get access to. You guys picked up Isak whilst mid-table. Look at mid-table sides budgets anywhere else! Because tourism matters in football, as does the number of people around you, Tottenham have access to the population of London plus tourists, Newcastle have access to the population of Newcastle plus the about 800,000 people that visit every year. Being in London is a massive advantage for any team simply due to the amount of people that can be accessed. How many other clubs could win nothing since 2008 and still be considered big six? and what financial rules are those? Right now PL clubs are allowed around 105m in losses over a 3 year period. How much should it be? 200m? 300m? 1bn?  It's easy to make generalized statements about the utopia you want but it's much harder to be specific. Any financial rule you make will affect smaller clubs more than ""bigger"" clubs unless all clubs are only allowed to have a fixed amount in expenses (wages + amortization). Even then you can't prevent under the table shenanigans that clubs like Man City partake in.  You're not advocating for a change in rules. You're advocating to remove all rules Just look at Malaga and how they fared once their owner stopped pumping money in. That part is easily solved. Let the Villa owners put £1bn in an escrow account if they want, the club can draw down £100m a year say and it's topped up annually.  If it was about sustainability, owner funding would be capped at precisely nil. Currently it's allowed up to a point at which the big 6 clubs will never be threatened.  Further, currently clubs are heavily reliant on TV money, clubs like Arsenal on their Emirates backers etc, owner funding is arguably less flaky in some ways, depends a lot on the owners of course. It’s not really that easy to increase revenue without spending a shitload of money though. You increase revenue through success. Rarely do you get success without spending money. It also gives clubs with nation states as owners an even bigger edge. City, PSG and Newcastle all would end up dominating the sport even quicker if they did not have to limit themselves to what they could get away with. Depends on the owner and the level of funding, surely? What do you mean, take their money back out?  Like I say elsewhere, you can solve the ""sustainability"" point easily. Pre-fund the salary commitments until the end of the contracts if you like (a bit extreme of course, but doable). Establish a trust. Put some money in escrow etc etc.  And as you also point out, PSR hasn't exactly stopped the sustainability issues from arising, so it's not even doing that bit right, although the Everton situation is pretty unique. No it was approved by UEFA in 2009 and introduced in 2013  Even if you look at 2009, Chelsea had won the league 3 times by then. Premier league can remain competitive even with lower spending cap. There's like 10 non-prem clubs in europe that can outspend your mid-table clubs lmao. And where are they now? What happened to Leeds following their big gamble in the days of Peter Ridsdale? By investing smartly and growing in a sustainable manner à la Spurs > This way, rich and ambitious owners who want to invest more money into the football ecosystem can actually do so. Free market if you will.  Sounds terrible. Instead of empowering owners, the ideal should be getting rid of them.  But what do I know, free market in everything outside football eventually leads into power and wealth consolidation, I'm sure in football it'll lead to more competition though! And what if the owner artificially inflates revenue like City does? All you are doing is giving them an even bigger edge compared to the legacy clubs with only Newcastle on nature of their owner being able to compete. Than Man Utd? They’re not comparable financially All that waffle just to say ""I've got mine"" How has disproving your point proved it? When was this ? I feel you keep moving goalposts to suit your argument   Spurs invested wisely,  with the stadium, commercial deals outside of the premier league.  That’s is a lie , arsenal had a stadium debt and were selling a key player very season. One season they literally only  bought Petr Cech in the summer. When arsenal were losing Clichy, nasri, rvp,  Fabregas, Adebayor, hleb, Chamberlain in emirates  era to pay of debt not one other club or newspaper complain about them being picked apart. Instead they remained sustainable and within the rules on the league.   Now the debt is paid arsenal are spending 200m to play catch up with the juggernaut which is city.  We shouldn’t change the rules because clubs broke them trying to jump the gun isntead of doing long term investment Wait so are you denying arsenal had to sell players every year to pay off debt? Do you want me to bring out the transfer list of outgoing sand fees paid during 2007-2015 when they had emirates debt ? I know it sucks that arsenal didn’t break the rules like other clubs.  Utd literally signed weghorts ob loan to avoid FFP on January 2023, arsenal singed Raya oj loan and made permanent for next season to avoid FFP. Clubs stick within the rules.   Not impossible just harder, villa and Newcastle fans want the east chelsea/city mode where there club just gets pumped with huge amounts of money to try leapfrog their way into top 4, and that isn’t the case anymore. Will likely take you longer to break in.   Tough cookie but that’s the rules and regulations with the premier league  What wages were countinho on , as you should no ffp relates to wages as well as transfer fee.  If you want villa to be completely independent from prem finances why don’t you campaign for them to be independent form prem tv rights and let them broker their own tv rights deals and stop riding to coattails of “the big six” viewing numbers. Spurs in the next few years should be capable of spending far more than they have been in previous seasons due to the completion of their new stadium and the increased revenue that comes with it.  The hardest part is already done, the stadium is a huge boon to the club. I don’t know in what world you live in but there’s no way billionaires or investment funds would accept such risk… Mate lad greggs you think net spend is the only thing that matters  Do you know why Manchester United have debt? Because their shitty owners  And to prove my point even better, FFP is there to protect your from those shit owners, if United weren't a commerical giant to offset their cheap owners, they would be in DEBT + in a terrible spot due to money spent that wouldn't be able to be covered if they weren't big commercially   So yeah great rebutal you proving my point What threshold? Of spending every penny you receive on wages? There's more money that Everton need to spend on top of that, namely £45m in operating expenses. Without even taking into transfers or the stadium the club lost £40m quid in the last financial state. Despite a £47m profit on player trading the club still lost £89m in total for 22/23 which is why net spend is a limited view of finances.   The fact that Everton were needing 777 partners to loan them £200m over the past year or so to help with running the club suggests they aren't running within their means? https://www.football.london/premier-league/im-billionaire-premier-league-club-28731177  LMFAOO, you are truly a genius, Palace have FFP problems Yeah, 92% wage:turnover ratio in the 2022/23 financial numbers really emphasizes how much you spend within your means. You do realise that the glazers loaded united up with that debt? If they were forced to repay it, it would come from the sale of the club to another owner, which would generate the money to cover the debts. Their revenue is what matters,  which is lightyears above villa's. Fair enough, I might be wrong then. Yes, Wednesday and Leicester are unquestionably bigger than Leicester. What planet are you on if you think they're bigger?  Total trophies is the only barometer of success. No one cares about your points difference over 50 years, they look at your trophies.  Do Liverpool's trophies not count because most were in the 70s and 80s? Of course they do. Trophies are trophies. I'm not even sure what you're arguing.  Villa are factually in the top 6 most successful clubs, your opinions on type of trophy or date of trophies importance is your subjective opinion. So becuase  of your p,rejudice and fear, the bix six should be left as the only ones with a chance to play in the top competitions, due to massive financial advantage. got it. Are we really going to pretend like revenue generation in football isn’t directly linked to success? You have a couple of clubs who have done things semi-organically (Spurs, Brighton) but they still hit a wall don’t they?    I’m not saying do away with all rules and let it be like the Wild West again (when most of these clubs actually had their success to begin with) - but it also shouldn’t be the case that you’ve got multiple clubs getting hit with points deductions in a single season. A lot of these clubs aren’t even competing for anything, it’s literally just to survive in the premier league.   And yeah, they could all play by the rules and the gap between the top 6 and every other club just becomes larger and larger every year until they fuck off and make their own league like they already tried to do. IMO the limits should be placed on the top clubs more than those at the bottom if we’re looking at it from a sporting fairness point of view, if anything. Tourists don't generally support a team in the place they're visiting. Tottenham have access to the same population as Newcastle, if you mean locally, they're are many professional clubs in London  >How many other clubs could win nothing since 2008 and still be considered big six?  Winning nothing (trophies I assume you mean) has no baring on being part of the big six. That's an interesting argument, if I can't come up with a perfect idea (which many highly trained highly paid officials and experts have failed to do) then I can't complain about the multitude of weaknesses in the current one which long term leads to a league that doesn't encourage competitiveness outside of the existing top teams?   Look at the players/managers Southampton had through their doors before they get relegated and imagine what could've been achieved if they could compete financially with the clubs that bought their players. I'm a Derby fan, I know all about it. Our owner gambled on promotion and failed, and us fans almost lost our club. Spurs were 15th in Revenue in the PL 24 years ago. Behind Leeds, Blackburn, Newcastle, Villa to name a few.  Spurs owners haven't put a penny into the club since 2000. (They bought £150M worth of shares last year which gave us a boost I'll admit but they didn't do it for free is my point)  So we haven't spent a ""shitload of money"" outside of whatever our revenue brings in. Completely self sufficient. And our revenue since then has gone up 400% or so.  We did it bit by bit and had an incredibly smart chairman that led us there.  So yes, it's entirely possible to increase revenue without spending a shit ton. You can be self sufficient and improve bit by bit but the problem is greedy owners and sometimes fans that lack patience.  Even now, there's so many rival fans that don't understand why many Spurs fans think Levy is the best chairman in football (or in the conversation) and it always comes down to ""but trophies"".  I'm happier with my team being able to survive and flourish than win 1 PL and then collapse under our own hubris into the Championship Yo Yo honestly. No, it's not meant to be easy, creating a club which is competing at the very top isn't going to be easy. Don't know why people expect it to be. It's built over decades, and that's fine.  Newcastle want to be able to jump to the top because by pure luck, they were selected to be the fun project of sportswashing, bored billionaires, and yet moan about things being ""unfair""? It absolutely is incredibly easy to increase your revenue, you just need to be willing to exploit your club commercially and have intelligent people running things. Which, as I say, is the competitive argument. Which I agree with TBF, there should be some limits.   Although, that said, rich owners meaning successful clubs has been the norm for essentially all of this sport's history. Abu Dhabi, Abramovich, Jack Walker, John Moores,  and back through history as long as you like.   But pretending PSR is about sustainability is a huge old lie. > What do you mean, take their money back out? >  >   Take dividends ala Glazers or asset strip. Well if the owner puts money in, they likely wanna see return on their investment. Maybe some are in it purely for the prestige, but if they change their mind or get bored they still may turn around and decide they wanna recoup some of what they put in.  Things are far better than they were sustainability wise too. A lot of clubs fucked it in the first couple of decades of the premier league, even big 6 Liverpool almost ended up in administration. I’d agree there probably are better things we could do to help sustainability, but that’s at odds with owner funding. The more outside money you allow a club to put in, the more risk of it blowing up you incur. For me I’d rather try to prevent clubs going under and disappearing and sacrifice some owner funding ability. £100m signings drive headlines and viewership on the global scale. Real Madrid and Barcelona command huge viewership because of their big signings. Teams outside the big 6 in the Premier League don't.  Bringing the big 6 down a level financially just leaves another league to come in and draw away the worldwide TV audience. Spain have been the league trying to do it for the last 10/15 years.  It's in the Premier Leagues best interest to make as much money as possible, and having their teams spend more helps that. Blackburn were bought by a new owner who did not allow them to spend the same way which is what killed Blackburn. The Leeds that challenged was a Leeds in the 80s. The Leeds you talking about in 00s cannot be compared to a Newcastle, Man City or Aston Villa owner wealth. FFP does not fix the Leeds situation, just look at Everton with less debt than Man Utd but become the club that gets penalised. This is ultimately the only real option, but it doesn't really apply equally to all clubs. There will always be some who have greater commercial potential than others based on geography. That is what it is, I guess.   I can't, for example, ever see a scenario where Leicester are able to be as commercially successful as Spurs. Although we have been horrifically miss managed finsncially since winning the league. yh, just have one of the best strikers your country has ever had for roughly a decade play for your club and don't do something that doesn't work out, simple Spurs are in the big 6 and wanted the ladder pulled up behind them, yet still can't really compete at the top. That surely shows how broken it is. Are spurs competitive for the league? Even during the Leicester season where we joke about 3rd in a two horse race the spurs fans make it clear they were never in the title race. Spurs lol The fact that spurs have managed it, puts the lie to the fact that ffp stops challenger clubs... The point is City wouldn’t need/have needed to inflate revenue, they would’ve been able to just dump the money in with no subterfuge Not long term but Villa is clearly in a better place to service its debts. It’s far more liquid No, I actually just want to reward clubs for being well run  Brentford, Brighton, etc. have all climbed the pyramid by being well run. Yes they've stalled it a bit due to established clubs being at the top but clubs like that are now in the top 20 clubs in England. They're well run and deserve to be there  If a club can just ignore that like Wrexham just by outspending it's contemporaries, then you're not rewarding anything. You're just giving it to the richest  Liverpool could have ended up like Everton, Everton could have ended up like Leeds, and Leeds could have ended up like derby. Poorly run clubs don't do as well but if you have billions in owner funding, you get to bypass that when 90% of clubs in England can't do that I’m not moving my goal posts.  I said I don’t think it’s possible doing it against the current big 6. There wasn’t a big 6 when spurs did it.   I think you’re confused on what I’ve said about arsenal United had already spent over £200m that season before they signed Weghorst. Arsenal had also spent £200m before signing Raya.  How can teams like Villa and Newcastle compete with teams that can spend so much more? lol I get that but ultimately it can't be taken for granted that they will turn into champions tomorrow >Mate lad greggs you think net spend is the only thing that matters  You claimed we spent above our means, that catergorically is not true from a day to day club operations costs  The stadium build took us above our means after losing sponsorships due to sanctions on Russian owned business'  Meaning Everton lost USM and Megafon sponsors and the stadiums naming rights   >Do you know why Manchester United have debt? Because their shitty owners  Do they're quite literally not a healthy commercial club then are they, if their owners are stupid and they're £1b in debt then thats a clear sign they are in fact. Not. Healthy.  >FFP is there to protect your from those shit owners  That clearly isn't the case, all the clubs that have been punished and are facing punishments is because their owners have invested in the clubs for their futures  Everton - Building a stadium for the long term future of the club  Forest - Signing players after being promoted with 13 senior players   Leicester - Trying to keep up competitively after winning the league, winning the FA Cup and European qualifications  Aston Villa - Investing to take their team to the highest level  The only 'shit owners' in the league are quite literally 2 teams who FFP benefit more than anyone. Man United and Chelsea.   >if United weren't a commerical giant to offset their cheap owners  Man United have literally the most expensive assembled squad in the PL you dope  Squad cost of £992m  The most expensive weekly wages in the league with £3.8m per week  You're chatting the utmost shite 8% of our revenue is quite evidently, not being spent on wages.  That's why the ratio is 92%, not 100%  Everton's wage bill has dropped significantly since 2022  >The fact that Everton were needing 777 partners to loan them £200m over the past year or so to help with running the club suggests they aren't running within their means?  That's now why 777 were loaning Everton money, they loaned money to the club because they were in the process of buying the club, the deal fell through because of in house fighting amongst 777 which seen Josh Wander removed from his post  Because of that, Moshiri has gone back to using his own money in running the club until he finds a new buyer Literally nothing in that article states Palace are in FFP trouble, Nothing  That article is John Textor's open letter to his stance on PSR and FFP  Read the article. 92% means your wages are lower than your revenue btw >Yes, Wednesday and Leicester are unquestionably bigger than Leicester [sic]. What planet are you on if you think they're bigger?  The planet where Leicester have finished ahead of Wednesday every season bar three for the last 25 years (which happens to be the last time Wednesday were in the top flight) and get significantly higher attendances despite having a smaller ground.   >Total trophies is the only barometer of success  So just to be totally clear, you're genuinely arguing that Old Etonians/Oxford University/Wanderers/Clapham Rovers/Royal Engineers etc are bigger clubs than Palace, Brighton, and Fulham?  >Villa are factually in the top 6 most successful clubs  No, Villa are factually sixth on the list of clubs by trophies excluding super cups (include those and they drop behind Spurs). You can say that's the only thing that defines how big successful a club is if you like, but that's not an objective or the only way of doing it, no matter how hard you insist it is. Most of the big 6 don’t have a chance either. What the have Spurs been winning? Arsenal haven’t won the league in 20 years. Big 6 is just a term used to group big clubs with no chance along with small clubs with fascist game breaking owners. Man City and Spurs are not the same! Liverpool won once with a god tier season that was as much a one off as Leicester! And that’s it for big clubs over the last decade, the next decade isn’t looking more likely to be successful for big clubs. Of course it is, but short of here the squad budget for all 20 sides it’s the only remotely fair option. If you want a Middle Eastern super league with Saudi-on-Tyne superstars against Abu-Man City dream team, you guys should go organise it. Take away revenue based financial controls and that’s what you get cos the only thing that’ll matter is who your owner is and if it ain’t a corrupt sportswashing nation state you might as well pack up and go home.   The clubs being hit by points deduction are running wage bills at over or close to 100% of revenue. That’s mad. Let that continue to grow and clubs will go kaput. The moment you qualify for Europe you need to abide by their FFP anyway and it’s tighter than ours, so good luck with that it you don’t have revenue.   Linking possible expenditure to revenue is about rewarding clubs who grow organically, reducing pressure to over spend and creating a world where clubs who haven’t sold out to a guy who had a journalist dismembered with a bonesaw have half a chance. We know Newcastle’s owner are a G-20 nation, don’t worry medal of shame is in the post. That’s helped you massively in no time and I’m sure you’ll dominate football in the end, it’s just going to take more than 2 years to build up, you’ll cope. They don't need to support the team, they just need to visit the stadium. Tottenham's stadium made more off of non-football activities than Newcastle made altogether, do you think it's doing that if it's not in London? Your second point isn't really a fair argument though, more people are going to support Tottenham than Charlton for instance, since they're premier league, so breaking population down evenly amongst number of teams is disingenuous at best. By being in London, Tottenham have distinct advantages over other teams. This doesn't change how well they've done, it just shows that the country isn't a level playing field. Teams like Villa and Newcastle will never break into the top six without serious investment simply because they're in much worse locations with much worse infrastructure and less access to people. Tottenham outside of London wouldnt be able to do what they've done, they made the advantage work for them, it's admirable and it's part of the game. >  if I can't come up with a perfect idea (which many highly trained highly paid officials and experts have failed to do) then I can't complain about the multitude of weaknesses in the current one which long term leads to a league that doesn't encourage competitiveness outside of the existing top teams?  If they can't come up with an alternative, what makes you think a better solution exists?   Any rule that puts limits on spending will hurt smaller clubs more than bigger clubs. The only ""fix"" is to create a free for all system or something ridiculous where any club can spend 500m. But that creates a risk that clubs will go under. Is that a price you're willing to pay?     > Look at the players/managers Southampton had through their doors before they get relegated and imagine what could've been achieved if they could compete financially with the clubs that bought their players.  Spending doesn't prevent relegation. Look at how much Everton has spent and they've been on the brink of relegation for years Your club is in London. The non-London clubs can’t do that You do have an exorbitant amount of debt for the stadium though, no? Which from the outside seems to be one of your main sources of revenue.   Let’s say Levy pulled out, that debt actually puts you in a fairly precarious position - yet isn’t accounted for in FFP at all, even though the stated aim of FFP is to protect clubs from insolvency etc. Money = success is the entire history of the sport Well that's a completely different problem, isn't it? Glazers, Ashley etc treating the club as a piggy bank hasn't been stopped by PSR, and yet owners wanting to put money IN has.  Pretty weird, no?  People get upset when owners put ""too much"" in to cover losses, and also when they take anything out that arises from profits. Not sure where that leaves us tbh. But the cap doesn't have to be on the level of VfB Stuttgart or whatever. Its perfectly possible to create a cap that would still allow the smaller teams to keep the current level of spending while lowering the amount the big 6 can spend. Just to use some bullshit numbers to illustrate my point, if you cap yearly spending to 100m unless you sell, the smaller teams that never spend that much would still be able to spend freely (and outspend all non-elite clubs from other leagues) while it would also limit the advantage the big 6 clubs have over them. No one said we werent in the title race, we said we didnt bottle a lead we never had.   The world seemed to redefine the meaning of the phrase bottle job specifically for us and give our local rivals pass after pass for more egregious slips, but no one ever claimed were weren't in the race, only that we were chasing the lead the whole time The only reason we did not win a league title is because of scum, cheat clubs like you and Chelsea.  So yes, I'd say Spurs were and are competitive. I don’t think it’s possible now.  When spurs did it there wasn’t 6 teams spending like mad. That opportunity has been and gone. Again, based on what?  The Glazers running United at a loss doesn't suddenly mean that United are going to fall at most financial hurdles.  All clubs on the planet would rather have United's financial situation than Villa's, including Villa themselves. Well the current rule doesn't do that, look at Man Utd, run like shit, billion in debt, can spend more than anybody, so how is that rewarding well run clubs?   How is forcing Aston Villa to sell a key player to meet a PSR limit, rewarding well run clubs? Villa are being punished for their success. No wonder you've gone for Brighton and Brentford clubs that cannot and will not ever come near challenging liverpool.   Let's be real here. You like the rules because they disproportionately benefit Liverpool. Not sure why you're trying so hard to pretend otherwise.  The current rules reward clubs that happened to be ""big"" at a completely arbitrary point in time, and ensures they will never lose their seat at the top club. Liverpool is one of those clubs. So consider me unconvinced your passionate defence of the statue quo is motivated by anything but pure self interest . Spurs never spent outrageously and were getting raised every year by Utd and Madrid but still broke into top 4 and for period overtook Utd/ arsenal .   You want clubs to have billionaire owners pump money into them to leapfrog other clubs and get into top 4 like city/Chelsea. That’s isn’t going to happen anymore and these go bs will have to invest smartly and efficiently and will be harder and take longer to establish.  It’s not impossible just you won’t be able to spunk 20m on ings or countinho. Invest in youth, buy smart , sell well.  Literally what arsenal did to challenge Utd. Wenger was getting bargains in the French league to build a super team while Utd were smashing English transfer records.  Can’t look for the easy way of being pumped full of money to try buy your way in by breaking the rules Is that a no then when you don’t want the press money that big clubs generate from viewing figures then ?  Someone wants their cake and eat it too Yes but spending 92% on purely wages is mental in any capacity? There's no threshold a club can spend on wages but if you want to be financially secure then spending so much on wages and then only having £13.2m to spend on everything else is worrying because it cost Everton £45m to run the club day to day.   > Everton's wage bill has dropped significantly since 2022  It dropped £3m since 2022 according to Evertons public accounts however wage to revenue % increased from 90% to 92%. They lowered it from 2021 to 2022 by about £20m which is good (it was a fall of 95% to 90% wage to revenue %) but with revenue falling and operating expenses increasing then it only goes some of the way.   They loaned money to Everton because they were in the process of buying the club but the fact Everton needed those loans with awful rates is the most significant thing.   I really hope Everton as a club get out of this and find an owner who will make proper decisions, back them well and get them to a point they should be at but your owners have properly fucked your finances up the past number of years and is no way sustainable. Yeah, and if you dont have to spend any money on anything else at all and let your players walk to their away games, then I am sure that is very healthy profit margin for a football club! Sadly thats not the case, you spend over your means for years, make losses all the time, because your players need other weird stuff than wages like eating food at the cantine, using ""toilets"" and water after eating and training, and sleeping in beds during away games.  OP said you spent over your means, you tried to make it about ""net spend"" that is an imaginary number no one cares about, and then you tried to make your wages sound normal instead of the ridiculous rate they sit at. Healthy wage ratios for football clubs are between 50-70% btw, not >90% year after year. Super cups? Villa have one super cup. Take that out and Villa still have more than Spurs.  You are literally the first fan I've seen who has said fan sizes and trophies aren't a measure of if a club is bigger than another.  But if you think Leicester, who are more known for their rugby team than football, are bigger than Blackburn and Wednesday then I have no idea what to tell you. You probably think Leicester are bigger than Leeds as well based on your metrics? Is it such a mental idea to have a transfer and salary cap and leave it at that?   Does that not achieve spending controls while also limiting the top clubs and reducing the gap between 1-20? Why would Levy pulling out change anything? At all? The debt is on the club, it's £21M per season and the Revenue we bring in is around £450M on a bad season.  Unless ENIC sells the club and the new owners literally come in, take every single bit of revenue and stop paying everything to do with the club, it makes absolutely no difference. If that happened, loan repayments on the stadium would be the tip of the iceberg.  Not sure why Stadium loan repayments matter at all honestly, it's always been a rule that stadium and training construction is not counted by FFP. Debt against stadiums and training infrastructure rightly isn't included, as that's what encourages owners to invest for the future rather than chucking money at players to try and achieve overnight success Yeah exactly, so why would the premier League want to make their elite clubs less competitive against the elite clubs of other leagues?  You use the phrase ""limit the advantage"" when I think it should be about ""reducing the disadvantage"" for smaller clubs who have the facility to spend. I'm happy with an upper cap, but for the benefit of the premier league on the global scale it shouldn't restrict any club when competing against a European team for a player. I'm not sure who you support but we'll just talk about spurs since that's the topic and you've somehow invented a fake world where us and Chelsea don't exist.  Which seasons exactly would spurs have challenged for a title without us and Chelsea? They didn't challenge for the PL before Abramovic and haven't come a close second or even second in any league, never mind one won by city or Chelsea. They are a top club but they've never completed for the title in the PL era and that era is been for more than a third of a century now without competing for the league. Which is what this entire thread is about, trying to get to the next steps but the current regulations stop any club that starts getting close, like villa. The best you could hope for is to be another spurs but then there's only so many spaces at the top and united can be as bad on the pitch as they want but they'll never struggle for revenue. We first broke top 4 properly during the prem era under redknapp in 09/10  Way after Chelsea broke the league Man united are close to ffp, they have old training facilities, their stadium is falling apart, and they're 8th. They got very successful at the right time and have been limping along but it's pretty clear they haven't had success equal to what you'd expect. But with all that, they are sustainable as they are spending what they earn  Villa isn't well run clearly. If they have a 90% wage to turnover ratio then it's not sustainable is it  And no I like the current rules because it allows well run clubs to somewhat compete with clubs whose owners fund everything. Id be up for more limits to funding from owners because it means that clubs have to actually grow organically You completely misunderstood what I’ve wrote.  I’m agreeing spurs didn’t spend then. I’m saying right now it’s impossible to do what spurs did because you’ve got current arsenal and spurs spending loads.  If two bad transfers is all it takes then no team if making it into the top 5 But surely you understand that football has changed since then? It is mental  And we have been cutting on that with high earners being moved on etc  >It dropped £3m since 2022 according to Evertons public accounts however wage to revenue % increased from 90% to 92%.   Loss of sponsorships because of Ukraine war meant lower revenue and the ratio took a heavy switch  >They loaned money to Everton because they were in the process of buying the club but the fact Everton needed those loans with awful rates is the most significant thing.   We didn't 'need' those loans, 777 awarded the loans in the hopes of taking over the club and once takeover was completed turn those loans into equity, which they can still do  Moshiri stopped putting his money into the club because he had agreed to make the sale, obviously now because that sale fell through he is back to using his own money until he finds another buyer  With numerous parties interested >Healthy wage ratios for football clubs are between 50-70% btw, not >90% year after year.  We haven't been running at 90% year after year, we were running at those costs for a couple of seasons  There are 8 teams in the league that operate in wage to revenue below 70%  5 of those teams are Arsenal, Man U, Liverpool, Man City and Spurs  Those 5 teams have the highest wages in the league, with Man U, Arsenal and Man City operate at double the amount of wages of Everton   The only teams that can feasibly manage to run at the ratio you're claiming to be healthy are the clubs that make so much money that the ratio doesn't even apply to them anyways I love how you keep ignoring the point about Palace/Brighton/Fulham etc Vs Clapham Rovers/Old Etonians etc because it obviously shows how mental your argument is. Did you think no one would notice?   > Super cups? Villa have one super cup. Take that out and Villa still have more than Spurs.  Yes, and if you include super cups Spurs are ahead. Which is what I wrote  > Leicester, who are more known for their rugby team than football,  Delusional. Not everyone is a sports obsessed middle aged bloke still wishing it was the 20th century Idea on the table is anchoring total spend to five times the lowest earner, wouldn’t help much for disparities in the top half though. It’s not to replace FFP, you still need to make most of the money yourself but it would stop nation states running off into the sunset. I think the dummy run of it, showed last season, Man City would have been close to breaching it, chelsea would have everyone else was fine with lots of wiggle room.   Tbh the problem with hard cap squad costs is that it’s not the spirit of football. Want that and there’s competitions like The Hundred in cricket. One of the things that makes football engaging is that decisions matter. That player you bought cheap who blew up and goes for a fortune let’s you rebuild your side, that legendary manager who turned your club into a household name leaves a mark for a generation. It’s why we watch and why we care through the off-season.   Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal weren’t outspending Newcastle at the time, he just drove the club forward with scouting, team prep, nutrition, tactics etc.. Should making a name for a club through brilliance be rewarded? Hell yes! Football isn’t equal, never has been never will be, everyone trying to climb the greasy pole.   At it’s core though it’s always been my lot vs your lot. Some people didn’t like that their lot weren’t so good, so they started bringing in oligarchs and nation states.  I want to stay as my lot vs your lot cos it’s what made football so brilliant. My dictator vs your dictator makes me sick, some super sterile every club gets X budget every year just kills the importance of results decisions. They aren’t counted by FFP because it isn’t ‘football’ related however 800odd million debt is obviously going to factor in if anyone was going to come in and buy the club - it could very easily make any deal for the club difficult to do depending on how much ENIC would demand in this hypothetical situation.  And yeah, great, your revenue is high but you still lost 86m last season.   The point I’m trying to make is that FFPs stated aim is to protect football clubs from insolvency etc while completely ignoring many of the factors that would actually lead to insolvency. Logically, why is it okay to spend whatever you want outside of players if the stated aim is to avoid insolvency? All of the spending matters as it would all factor in if it came to potential sales etc if owners pull out.   If our owners put us into a huge amount of debt building a 1 billion stadium and then got sick and tried to sell, who is taking that on? We aren’t worth 1 billion to start with. >Yeah exactly, so why would the premier League want to make their elite clubs less competitive against the elite clubs of other leagues?  Because it would make the league more competitive overall? It also wouldn't make them less competitive in Europe, if the cap was like 100-150m, there are like 4 clubs that can spend that sort of money every year outside the premier league (PSG, Bayern, Real, maybe Juve).  I think reducing the disadvantage would be great but how would you go about that in a realistic way? Newly promoted clubs would need a massive injection of money to be able to buy players but their facilities, staff and infrastructure would still be massively behind City, Liverpool or Spurs. It would also give the relegation candidates a massive advantage over Championship sides. Spurs were 2nd in 16/17 behind Chelsea so you have no clue what you're talking about. Spurs have absolutely underachieved but would have a very recent major trophy if it wasn't for financially doping clubs.   It's a given that legacy clubs like United or Liverpool have an innate advantage because of being big and having large fanbases, there's no getting away from it. But that does not mean that other clubs should be propelled into success through billionaire owners.   City and Chelsea have forever tainted this league and there's probably no turning back from this league turning into a hellscape of financially doped clubs, but I will support any rules that will put an even slight delay on this.   Villa and Newcastle fans will unfortunately have to survive this incredible injustice of having to wait for a few more years before their owners inevitably pump the clubs full of money. Everyone is spending loads. Money has gone up as footballs inflation has gone up as well. A 20m player is now 45m.  Teams across the prem are spendig laods but are not breaching ffp. West Ham did the same last summer.  Again you want a billionaire to leapfrog you into by pumping the club with money instead of investing like what spurs did. It’s going to take longer but tough cookie mate, the city/ Chelsea model isn’t happening again and nor should it I’m sorry but I’ll repeat again, invest in youth, buy smart,  and sell well. You want the east way of leapfrogging with billions of money like chelsea and city and not following the rules  That’s not happening, and you’re going to have to do it like how arsenal or spurs did. It’s harder and will take longer. It’s easier you come to terms with this now rather than looking for the easy way of breaking the rules. Yes like I said Everton have been heading in the right direction but it's still a fine line that'll need a lot of care.  Everton have also been unfortunate with some areas but they needed loans for day to day running of the club. If a club makes £172m in revenue but spends £200m+ in wages/operational costs then those loans are needed otherwise you can't run the coub.   You're 100% right that they wanted to turn them into equity which would've been ideal for the club (although having 777 as owners sounds less than ideal) but the fact is it's now unstable given 777s own precarious situation - they will not want equity but rather actual cash flow now.  Hope it all happens with a good owner and there does seem to be some positive shoots cause it's a proper club for locals but just thought your initial points over net spend was really shortsighted because like this year you can make a decent net spend profit but ultimately still lose tons of money greater than anything. >We haven't been running at 90% year after year, we were running at those costs for a couple of seasons  So... year after year? Which is why you are currently in deep shit FFP wise.  >There are 8 teams in the league that operate in wage to revenue below 70%  [I count 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1bdznxz/the_swiss_ramble_premier_league_clubs/), and that includes teams with less wages and more wages than Everton. So clubs from all sides of the spectrum manage it, and then there are Everton, Villa and Norwich.  >The only teams that can feasibly manage to run at the ratio you're claiming to be healthy are the clubs that make so much money that the ratio doesn't even apply to them anyways  How can poor Everton run that ratio, they cant possibly financially compete with fucking Brentford, Watford, Brighton and Leeds. So yes, wages are your main problem, have been for years, its not at all about net spend or you ""spending within your means"", you are spending outside your means the most of the entire PL. You are not just unhealthy, you are the fat kid sitting at home eating cheerios with Mountain Dew.  And if we extend the scope outside of England and look at my league, the Bundesliga, then the entire circus of the PL becomes extra funny bad. The Bundesliga has by a quick glance 0 clubs that spend more than 60% on wages. Imagine that, the Bundesliga where clubs get far less money in comparison, where players dont just move there because its the best league in the whole world, where clubs are fan held, actually manage to all be in the healthy zone. What point? You're saying Fulham are the same size club as Old Etonians?  Tottenham have never won the European super cup... So how would that put them ahead?  I'm not middle aged...  Mate if you want to compare club sizes based on goal difference then you do that but dont act surprised when no one agrees with you. Trophies and fan bases are what make big clubs and based on that Villa are objectively in the top 6. Well infrastructure retains its value far better than players. If £1bn is spent on a stadium, that's a tangible asset with some residual value. Sure maybe it's not all realisable if they wildly overspend, but it's an asset on the company's balance sheet which isn't being amortised over a few years like a player purchase is. Setting a cap of 150m is along the lines of what I am describing, because the post is about Villa not being able to spend that, and needing to sell their players? Same with Newcastle?   A newly promoted club would no longer be limited to spending under 30m if they had the ambition to stay in the league.   At the point of such a high cap, you then ask what is the point of the cap anyway? Realistically the only time it'd get outspent is when a top team hasn't invested in a couple of years and needs a refresh. You're living in a hypothetical. Spurs haven't challenged for titles. Yeah so they finished 2nd once in 33 years. Did nothing before Chelsea and city other than a league cup, done nothing since.   If city and Chelsea didn't exist you have no idea what would have happened. United, arsenal and Liverpool would have just been much stronger buying all the players we bought. But no one knows. The only way to compete with legacy clubs is external investment. Because spurs don't have it and don't compete for titles. The only ones who have competed needed huge investment and the legacy clubs quickly put a stop to that. They have fans because they won things, but arsenal and united haven't won much for a while and still dominate commercially. So how can anyone else grow a fan base, they can't earn it the right way because the legacy clubs are too strong commercially, the current financial rules means any attempt to actually challenge and compete and win to be a top club and then build a fan base can't happen. Villa have to sell when really they should be building on success. Qualified for the CL, best season in decades yet they need to sell?! That shows the current model isn't right.   If it's supposed to be all about winning it on the pitch then spending should be linked to performance on the pitch, now how much people will pay to have their name on the front of your shirt. West Ham sold their best player for 100m, surely they aren’t the best example.  What spurs did can’t be done now. Buying from the French league back then was more beneficial because players weren’t as well known. Right now every good young French players gets snapped up straight away.  Your strategy of following what worked 25 years ago wouldn’t work now.  Brighton have invested in youth, bought well and sold well and have gone backwards because the leagues so much more  difficult now.  It’s why even Wenger couldn’t make top 4 towards the end.  I’d just prefer rules where everyone could spend the same, that would be fair >So... year after year? Which is why you are currently in deep shit FFP wise.  Nah we're in deep shit FFP wise because we took out loans for the stadium build, but used the loans for the day to day operations whilst Moshiri funded the stadium build with his own money  For some stupid fucking reason  >I count 10, and that includes teams with less wages and more wages than Everton.  Leeds and Watford are no longer in the PL  >How can poor Everton run that ratio, they cant possibly financially compete with fucking Brentford, Watford, Brighton and Leeds.  We ran a ratio we could afford and then we lost sponsors against our wishes and then we couldn't afford it  >So yes, wages are your main problem, have been for years, its not at all about net spend or you ""spending within your means"", you are spending outside your means the most of the entire PL.  Our wages have been a problem, but the wages are within our means, because we can afford them, if couldn't afford them then the club would have gone under  Which we haven't  >The Bundesliga has by a quick glance 0 clubs that spend more than 60% on wages.   The Bundesliga are one of the most uncompetitive leagues in the world  A league completely dominated by one team  Bayern have won 18 of the last 25 league titles  An 11 in a row streak broken by a team winning their first ever title with an unprecendented unbeaten season. Leverkusen are one of Germany's biggest clubs and has one league title to their name  The very think you are praising the Bundesliga for, is the very same reason why the German league isn't as hotly followed compared to the PL Sure, the point I’m making is that nobody is going to pay the money it would take to buy Newcastle + the cost of some ridiculous stadium, are they?   You would think then, that if the point of the rules is to protect against that, that those things would then be taken into account.   We need governance in football, and rules to protect against exorbitant spending. Anyone with a brain would accept this. They could just be a lot better than they currently are, I don’t think that’s really a controversial statement. >Setting a cap of 150m is along the lines of what I am describing  It's just an example number, like I said originally, even a 100m cap would still let Prem Clubs outspend every other european team except the 4 I mentioned. At the moment Villa has to spend an insane amount of money to remain competitive because the big teams all have squads worth close to a billion which is just obscene. If you were capped at spending 100-150m a year, it would take a few years to build a really strong squad.  >Realistically the only time it'd get outspent is when a top team hasn't invested in a couple of years and needs a refresh.  You guys spent like 260m this season and sold 125 or so which would put you very close to the 150m cap and I don't think a treble winning team ""needs a refresh"". Chelsea spent like 500m and sold only half of that. United spent 200m and sold 60 and they STILL need a refresh. Arsenal spent 235 and sold 70.  >A newly promoted club would no longer be limited to spending under 30m if they had the ambition to stay in the league.  Can you explain this part to me please? I'm not sure I understood what you meant. Liverpool sold the best player to Barca and sent on and won the league.  Spurs sold the best player to Madrid and became regular champions league team for the following years:  Arsenal sold their best player year upon year while being in the top 4.  Villa sold their best player 2 years ago and our in the top 4 now.  West Ham sold rice , invested well and are now a better team. Brighton have gone backwards because they have like 6 key players injured. They also on paper sold well but they shouldn’t have sold 2 of their core midfield, so ultimately sold badly.  Yes Wenger couldn’t make top 4 and arsenal fans didn’t bitch or moan or ask to change the rules did they ?   I prefer everyone spends what they earn as a percentage. You wont to spend more look at you ceo and board for better investments. Follow the rules and stop looking for a billionaire bailout to jump into top 4. Football isn’t easy so I suggest you get used to it rather than try change the rules to end fit your club. When the big 6 we’re trying to change rules for the super league you guys threw a hissy fit, and rightly so, but now you want to change the financial rules so you can buy your way into top 4???  Nah mate follow the rules and stop trying to cheat They wouldn't have to. No bank is going to lend Newcastle £1bn to build a stadium, which means it'd be an unsecured loan from the owners. I work in accountancy rather than insolvency, but I don't think the Director could demand repayment if it would mean defaulting on other liabilities.  The issue with recklessly signing players is the ongoing obligation (wages) which can then collapse the club, that isn't the case with owner-funded stadiums. It's in the premier leagues best interest for the teams to outspend the other teams in Europe. They don't want to be second best to the 4 you mention. Real Madrid have enough power over players as it is, and the premier league will earn more money by competing with them.  City are in a privileged position where we can spend 100m a season and maintain a high level. For any team to move up the table, and stay up, they need to consistently outspend their peers. If there's a cap, and the top teams can maintain their level using it, it'd take many many years for other teams to grow to that level whilst using the same cap. That's why the cap would need to be higher than a regular amount of spending so teams can play catch-up.   No idea what I was on about with the newly promoted club line. How would everyone being able to spend the same equal us trying to buy our way into the top 4?  It would be a level playing field If the ongoing wage obligation is the issue then the premier league could just require owners to secure that money as a pre-requisite loan and then the outcome would be the same really, if they’re worried about clubs going insolvent in that way.   There’s a million different ways you could protect clubs futures outside of the way it is being done at the moment. >It's in the premier leagues best interest for the teams to outspend the other teams in Europe.  But they would still be able to do that. Like I said, Bayern, PSG, Real Madrid and Juve are the only other clubs that can spend 100m in a single transfer window.  >City are in a privileged position where we can spend 100m a season and maintain a high level. For any team to move up the table, and stay up, they need to consistently outspend their peers.  But that's impossible to do in either case. If you cap the spending, everyone can spend the same, if you leave it uncapped, Luton Town will absolutely never compete with Arsenal or City. KdB alone is probably more valuable than all Luton players put together.  >If there's a cap, and the top teams can maintain their level using it, it'd take many many years for other teams to grow to that level whilst using the same cap. That's why the cap would need to be higher than a regular amount of spending so teams can play catch-up.  So how would you do it? Bottom X teams in one season get a higher spending cap for the next season? You mentioned ""reducing the disadvantage"" a few comments ago but I don't really see a way to do that without ruining the football pyramid. If you give a big cash injection to the newly promoted sides, they have a massive, massive advantage over championship sides if they still find themselves in a relegation battle.  >No idea what I was on about with the newly promoted club line.  Lmao fair enough, I reread it several times trying to figure it out. Invest and build up your brand and commercial side of things. Like clubs such as arsenal and spurs have down to compete with its and Liverpool.  You getting a billionaire to pump money which isn’t the clubs to buy their way into top 4 is what the rules are here for.  Happened to Blackburn and happened to Leeds, also happens to qpr and Portsmouth which went bankrupt and need bailouts Arsenal have always been a massive club and brand. Do you not know their history? Why don’t you want villa to invest and build their brand like clubs sucks as spurs or arsenal did to become big, why are you looking for the east way of breaking the rules to allow a billionaire to pump money into a club to jump into top 4 further destabilising transfer fees and corrupting the game liek what city and chelsea have done ? Arsenal were already massive by the time ffp came into play. Why are you avoiding that fact? I’m not avoiding the fact. In the 90s arsenal scouted well and developed stars to compete with Utd. Are you denying that ?  Why do you want villa the cheat and leapfrog their way into top 4 without building commercial side and finances to a sustainable level and scouting and developing stars like what arsenal and spurs have done ? Why do you want more billionaires corrupting the game ?"

## Recovering Fantastic Mr Fox

*^(u/TedBoyMarino)*

Founded in 1921 as Palestra Itália by a group of Italian immigrants, Cruzeiro were forced to change their name after Brazil entered World War II in 1942. The new name picked is a reference to the Southern Cross, a constellation in the southern hemisphere that’s part of the identity of many southern nations, being represented in the Brazilian, Australian and Kiwi national flags. Cruzeiro is one of the giants of Brazilian football, being a multiple-time Brasileirão, Copa do Brasil and Libertadores champion, while also being one of the two only teams to have won a domestic triple crown: the state, national cup and national league titles in the same year. The other club to have done that are their fierce city rivals, Atlético Mineiro.

After winning back to back Copa do Brasil titles in 2017 and 2018, Cruzeiro’s fall from grace was quick and very public. Dealing with huge financial problems and a toxic player squad, the team was relegated to the Brazilian Série B for the first time in its history. After two seasons of bottom-half second division finishes, it seemed [even faith itself had abandoned the Raposa](https://twitter.com/essediafoilouco/status/1203813898773835777). Until, in December 2021, Ronaldo Nazario bought Cruzeiro. The Phenomenon is a Cruzeiro academy product and has bought the club both as a gesture of gratitude for his youth club, but also, and specially, as an undervalued asset in need of investment for a turnaround. After winning the Brasileirão Série B in 2022, Cruzeiro returned to top-flight and only escaped relegation on the second-to-last round, finishing 14th and getting the last spot for the Sudamericana.

2024 started with an early elimination in the Copa do Brasil to Sousa, a team with [a fat dinosaur giving a thumbs up with a ball on his feet as its crest](https://i.imgur.com/trSh4TO.png). After losing the Campeonato Mineiro finals to Atlético Mineiro, manager Nicolás Larcamón was fired, being replaced by Fernando Seabra, a former Cruzeiro academy coach on his first job at the helm of a senior squad. Not a lot is expected from Cruzeiro this year, a top-half finish would be seen as a big success. But with the backing of the supporters, and the potential for a continental cup run, who knows? 

**Starting XI** | [(4-2-3-1) Rafael Cabral; William, Neris, Zé Ivaldo, Marlon; Lucas Romero, Lucas Silva;  Mateus Vital, Matheus Pereira, Arthur Gomes; Juan Dinenno](https://i.imgur.com/2z0R2TV.png)
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | Cruzeiro’s mascot, the fox, was picked in 1945 as a reference to a former club president’s shrewdness in business-making, one that Ronaldo tries to replicate in his approach to transfers. [It’s also an obvious reference to the mascot of their rivals Atletico Mineiro, as foxes hunt roosters](https://i.imgur.com/2CmvlDg.jpeg).
**Familiar face** | **José Cifuentes**: the player with the most international caps on the team (20), the Equatorian midfielder is on loan from Rangers.
**Star of the show** | **Matheus Pereira**: on loan from Al Hilal, he’s the main offensive weapon for the team, with one goal and four assists in the state championship. His loan ends soon and Cruzeiro is trying to make it a permanent deal, but *values scare the board*.
**Wild card** | **Gabriel Veron**: signing on a no-cost loan from Porto (see a pattern?), Veron arrived with big expectations, got injured days after signing, but reportedly is almost ready to return.

## The Road to El Dorado

*^(/u/vvv4231)*

Located deep into the Centre-West region, surrounded by the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado savanna and the Pantanal wetlands, Cuiabá are perhaps the most remote among Brasileirão clubs. The youngest among all current top-flight clubs as well, Cuiabá was founded in 2001 and soon established local dominance, being the thirteen-time Campeonato Mato-grossense champions, collecting its most recent trophy this year. The club’s ascent through the national pyramid was similarly fast-paced, climbing from the Brasileirão Série D to top-flight in a mere ten years.

With the proud distinction of being one of the three Brasileirão sides yet to experience relegation to the Brasileirão Série B, Cuiabá expect to, for the fourth consecutive season, avoid that fate on a shoestring budget. Placing 12th on the 2023 season with the lowest payroll in top-flight, Cuiabá lost the mastermind of the campaign, manager António Oliveira, along with one of the team’s highlights, defensive midfielder Raniele, both to Corinthians for the 2024 season.

Still, there’s hope for Cuiabá on their endeavour to stay up. The club counts on the services of the mad lad striker Deyverson, who earned fame by scoring on Flamengo to earn Palmeiras their third Libertadores title in 2021 and joined Cuiabá in 2022, instantly becoming the side’s talisman and main goalscorer. His main partner in crime is Paraguayan journeyman Isidro Pitta, who helps his side’s direct game with his imposing build and height. The side, however, remains on the search for a new manager since the departure of Oliveira, with interim substitute Luiz Fernando Iubel not expected to guide the team for the 2024 campaign in spite of spending over two months in charge.

**Starting XI** | [(4-3-3) Walter; Ramon, Marllon, Bruno Alves, Matheus Alexandre; Lucas Mineiro, Fernando Sobral, Guilherme Madruga; Clayson, Deyverson, Isidro Pitta.](https://i.imgur.com/fmYPUHd.png)

**Fun fact** | The geodesic centre of South America is located in Cuiabá, and the team’s crest depicts the monument erected at its exact place.

**Star of the show** | **Deyverson** is the side’s reference and star player alongside **Walter**, the club’s third-most capped player in history.
**Wild card** | 23-year-old defensive midfielder and Puskás Award recipient **Guilherme Madruga** has claimed a starting spot at the team after joining from Brasileirão Série B side Botafogo de Ribeirão Preto.

## Soaring New Heights

*^(u/YuriDDP and u/mareo27)*

Founded on November 15, 1895, Flamengo are one of the biggest clubs in Brazil, with the biggest football fan base in South America. Throughout its history, Flamengo have won eight Brasileirão, three Libertadores and four Copa do Brasil titles. The Rubro-Negro won the 2022 Libertadores with an amazing record of 12 wins and 1 draw, the first time ever it was achieved on the competition.

2023 was a disastrous year for Flamengo’s standards. The board decided not to renew Dorival Júnior’s contract after having won the Libertadores and the Copa do Brasil the year before, as he was rumored to join the Brazil national team. Then, Flamengo announced Vitor Pereira as the new head coach. Due to internal turmoil on and off the pitch, Fla lost to Al-Hilal in the Club World Cup semi-finals and lost to Fluminense in the Campeonato Carioca finals. After that, Sampaoli was appointed manager, but [he lost the dressing room as his fitness coach punched Pedro because the player refused to warm up when he was about to be subbed in a 2-1 win against Atlético Mineiro](https://ge.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/2023/07/29/preparador-fisico-de-sampaoli-da-um-soco-no-rosto-de-pedro-apos-vitoria-do-flamengo-sobre-o-galo.ghtml). Sampaoli left Flamengo in 3rd place, 11 points behind leaders Botafogo but only 4 points ahead of 7th place Fortaleza.

Under Tite, who joined Flamengo in the second part of last season, Fla got relatively better and it was enough to qualify to 2024’s Copa Libertadores. In 2024, Fla have the best defense of all teams in Brazil so far, with only 3 goals conceded in 16 official matches. Now Tite has good players at his disposal all over the pitch, as Flamengo signed De La Cruz from River Plate to strengthen the midfield and defensive additions such as Viña and Léo Ortiz. Tite commands Flamengo on a 4-3-3 formation, with Erick Pulgar as the defensive midfielder, Nicolás de la Cruz as a box-to-box midfielder on the right side and Arrascaeta as the creative midfielder. Pedro is the centre-forward, helped by Éverton Cebolinha on the left and Luiz Araújo on the right. Fla play a possession-controlling game, but Tite can switch to a more direct game if needed.

**Starting XI** | [(4-2-3-1) Rossi, Varela, Fabrício Bruno, Léo Pereira, Ayrton Lucas; Pulgar, Nicolás de la Cruz, Arrascaeta; Luiz Araújo, Pedro, Éverton Cebolinha.](https://i.imgur.com/TIo4PsV.png)
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | Until the 60’s, Popeye the Sailor was the club’s mascot. However, rival fans used to call Flamengo fans “urubus” (vultures) pejoratively. On May 31, 1969, four Flamengo fans joined Maracanã with a hidden vulture on the bag. The rubro-negro was on a 4 year winless streak against Botafogo, but that vulture was released before the game with a Flamengo’s flag in its feet (just like Benfica’s and Lazio’s eagles) and Fla won 2-1. Since then, the Urubu has been the club’s mascot.
**Familiar face** | **David Luiz** is Flamengo’s most known player worldwide, as he played for Benfica, Chelsea, PSG and Arsenal and now he makes the bench for the Rubro-Negro.
**Star of the show** | Flamengo has arguably the best player in the country in the honors of **Giorgian De Arrascaeta**, a midfielder that mixes magic with effectiveness.
**Wild card** | **Matheus Gonçalves** and **Igor Jesus** are already impact subs and they may have chances throughout the season. Lorran is the newest hot prospect of the club.

## The First Year of the Rest of Our Lives

*^(/u/jggomes14)*

2023 was amazing — the greatest year in Fluminense's almost 122-year-long history. We started the year by beating Flamengo 4-1 to win the Campeonato Carioca and finished it by putting an end to the long night of July 2nd, 2008, it was amazing. But now it is time to look into the present. This year Fluminense started their campaign focused on beating Liga de Quito at the Recopa Sudamericana final — objective completed, but it ended costing us the rest of the Campeonato Carioca, where we were beat by Flamengo on the semifinals with a dreadful display.

After weeks of practice and better conditioning, we hope that the *Campeões da América* get back on their feet and start strong on our campaign towards the fifth Brasileirão title. Fluminense starts a new league season after a reasonable 7th place last year, whereas our attention was so directed to winning our first Libertadores title that we actually started neglecting the league in August.

After reinforcing the squad by signing players such as former Brazil internationals Renato Augusto and Douglas Costa, bringing David Terans from Pachuca and Gabriel Pires from Botafogo and loaning in Marquinhos from Arsenal, the squad is in better shape for taking on a very long Brazilian season, and we have the prospect (and hope) of bringing Thiago Silva back in July — let's see how this goes. Under Fernando Diniz, Fluminense play on a very ""different"" style, building from the back on extreme situations and focusing on grouping a lot of players in one side and building up on that same side, while having a lethal striker such as Germán Cano in the box, scoring at least 40 goals a year, as he did in 2022 and 2023.

**Starting XI** | [(4-2-3-1) Fábio; Samuel Xavier, Manoel, Felipe Melo, Marcelo; André, Martinelli, Ganso; Jhon Arias, Germán Cano, Marquinhos.](https://i.imgur.com/r9xE0md.png)
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | Fábio will beat Zé Roberto's record and turn into the oldest player in Brasileirão history this season.
**Familiar face** | **Fernando Diniz** was the Brazil manager up until January; European fans might be surprised by **Felipe Melo**, **Marcelo**, **Ganso**, **Douglas Costa** and **Renato Augusto** playing together; Arsenal fans might see **Marquinhos** featuring in a lot of matches.
**Star of the show** | **Jhon Arias**. The Colombian is poised for his breakout season as the main man.
**Wild card** | **John Kennedy**. Our boy, our Menino Rei, the one who brought it home. After having the best season of his career and placing himself on his own legend tier, JK is a bet for giving Diniz a selection headache. Maybe other kinds of headaches too, but hopefully just a selection one.

## “He who always come, eventually win” - Marcelo Paz

*^(u/balancethat)*

Fortaleza starts 2024 more than trying to get his pride together after the heartbreak in the 2023 Copa Sudamericana final against LDU from Ecuador and the awful spell that, in the last case, made the team think of relegation late in the championship in one of the tightest Brasileirão of all time, starts the year with the mission of living up the expectation that he constructs around himself as long he keeps building one of the most admire ascensions in recent Brazilian football history. The team now works to solidify the idea that he has to be on the first page of the Brasileirão, keeping the base squad that brought so much success to the team, as long he recovers from the defeat at the Manjadinho’s final against the fierce rival and aiming high regionally, nationally and, maybe, internationally as long attract the eyes of Brazil in answering what's next for after Punta del Leste.

Founded in 1918 by a Brazilian student called Alcides Santos, fascinated with the French colors (what explains the red, blue, and white) and with football in his popularization in France and the world, Fortaleza after 2017 and eight years of hurt in the Série C, experiment his greatest rise since the 60's and his runner-ups participations in the Taça Brasil, the Brasileirão predecessor, being stopped only by the mighty Palmeiras' Academia de Futebol and Botafogo of the also mighty Leonidas. In this rise, Fortaleza collected a five-peat of the Campeonato Cearense, Ceará's state championship, two successes in the Copa do Nordeste (the regional cup) in 2019 and 2022, a Série B title in 2018, a semifinal of the Copa do Brasil in 2021 and, last year, his highest when, in a campaign with victories against greats of the South American game like Libertad and Corinthians, ended up being runners-up of the Copa Sudamericana in a fierce decision against a experimented rival in LDU. Always supported by the ""Torcida VAB"" (RBW, red-blue-white) which are being known for its creative tifos, being one of the stable top 10 in the country of occupation and average audience in the good and the bad.

Commanded by his manager Juan Pablo Vojvoda, an outsider who arrived in 2021, after a disaster in the succession of the mighty Rogério Ceni, coming from the history runners-up season at Unión La Calera in Chile. Vojvoda wins hearts and minds with his devotion to the project, refusing consistently big names of the game like Atlético Mineiro, Corinthians, Vasco, and São Paulo, and his catchphrase, impressed in walls, photos, and especially minds of the players in the Alcides Santos Excellency Center in the heart of the city: ""Intensidad"". ""Intensity"" in Spanish. Vojvoda comes to one more year solidifying his status as GOAT in Fortaleza's managerial realm. Taking part in the 4th, 5th of the series of five titles in Campeonato Cearense, the title of 2022 Copa do Nordeste, and the runner-up campaign in the 2023 Sudamericana.

**Starting XI** | [(3-5-2) João Ricardo, Titi, Emanuel Britez, Benjamin Kuscevic; Tinga, Bruno Pacheco; Hércules, Zé Wélison, Kervin Andrade; Juan Martín Lucero, Imanol Machuca.](https://i.imgur.com/T2O8Q7r.png)
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | A Hungarian journalist called Áron Aranyossy, inspired by a feeling of monotony in his coverage, got to Twitter and asked for inspiration. After starting to talk with supporters and other journalists, Fortaleza got in his mind, he started to follow the team in 2019 and, at the same time, he created Erod FC. A Fortaleza filial with the same crest, colors, and name (Erod in Hungarian means Fortaleza) and even got the nickname ""Gringo do Pici"".
**Familiar face** | **Marinho** was at the top of South America in 2021 when he led Santos to a surprising appearance in the Libertadores final. However, his career took a downturn when he moved to Flamengo. In 2023, he joined Fortaleza's squad and experienced highs and lows. Notably, he scored a spectacular free-kick against Libertad in the Sudamericana during a crucial moment, earning him some credit and support from fans.
**Star of the show** | **Kervin Andrade** has captured the attention of blue-red-white supporters. The young Venezuelan midfielder, hailed by The Guardian as one of the best of the 2005 generation of players, was brought from Deportivo La Guaira. He showcased his skills in the Copa São Paulo in January and quickly caught the eye of Vojvoda. With the squad lacking a ""camisa 10"" capable of orchestrating the game and creating chances, he has proven himself and aims to impress not only in Brazil but also in Venezuela, having received his first call-up in the last international window. Additionally, he made his international debut against Guatemala in the same window.
**Wild card** | **Yago Pikachu** is one of the leaders of this squad. Versatile, playing in the attacking wing, the wing back position, and most recently, as a forward in front of the goal coming from the reserves, he aims to prove even more that he wants to be in the pantheon of Tricolor's heroes, just like Tinga and Marcelo Boeck.

## The best defense is a good offense

*^(/u/buchhy)*

The last few years have been a rollercoaster of emotions for the Tricolor Gaúcho. After an unexpected relegation in 2021 and a steady yet unremarkable campaign to bounce back up from the second division in 2022, Grêmio's first year back among Brazil's elite was nearly perfect: led by the legendary Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez, the Imortal achieved a surprising second-place finish, only 2 points behind champions Palmeiras. However, despite the commendable showing from Renato Portaluppi's side, the end of the year was also a bitter one for gremistas as star-man Suárez confirmed his departure to Inter Miami, following a remarkable season in which El Pistolero netted 17 goals and provided 11 assists in 33 games.

To bolster their attacking options, Grêmio have opted for depth. Former Atlético de Madrid and Chelsea striker Diego Costa was the man chosen to lead the attack, while the fun-sized Venezuelan international Yeferson Soteldo (on loan from Santos) and former Boca Juniors, LA Galaxy and Atlético Mineiro's Cristian Pavón have been signed to strengthen the wings. In contrast, gremistas might feel like the defensive sector of the team has been neglected by the board. Despite conceding a worrying total of 56 goals in the league last season (the third-worst defensive record in the league overall, and the worst among the 16 teams that avoided relegation), the club is yet to announce any significant signings for their aging backline.

The start of the year has been promising for the Tricolores, as the team recently conquered their seventh consecutive Campeonato Gaúcho title following a 3-1 win on aggregate against fellow Brasileirão side Juventude, which brought them a step closer to equaling rivals Internacional's record eight-year title streak (from 1970 to 1978). However, eyebrows have been raised after Grêmio's bumpy start to their Libertadores campaign, recording two 2-0 losses against Bolivian side The Strongest and Chilean side Huachipato. On the pitch, the fluidity and chemistry between the attackers shows promise, but the team's slow defensive transitions have led to some concerning gaps in marking, resulting in worryingly eventful matches.

**Starting XI** | [(4-2-3-1) Caíque; João Pedro, Rodrigo Ely, Kannemann, Reinaldo; Villasanti, Pepê, Pavón, Cristaldo, Gustavo Nunes; Diego Costa.](https://i.imgur.com/eehbGq9.png)
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | The first-ever match between rivals Grêmio and Internacional was a 10:0 thrashing… On Grêmio’s favour.
**Familiar face** | The Brazilian-born Spanish international **Diego Costa** is the most recognizable face within the squad. With successful spells at Atlético de Madrid and Chelsea, Diego was the man tasked with replacing Luis Suárez. The Spanish striker was one of Grêmio's key players in their recent Campeonato Gaúcho title, scoring six goals in six games.
**Star of the show** | Paraguayan defensive midfielder **Mathías Villasanti** is the current fan favourite at the Arena do Grêmio. Due to his exceptional work rate and athleticism, Villa was a key part of Grêmio's impressive campaign in 2023, which earned him a spot on the official Brasileirão Team of the Season.
**Wild card** | The Argentinean playmaker **Franco Cristaldo** is the main responsible for supplying Grêmio's attacking trio, while also providing threat from long range and set pieces. Moreover, the skilled 18 year-old winger **Gustavo Nunes** has earned a spot in the starting XI after Yeferson Soteldo's injury earlier in the season and should be one of the most exciting youngsters to keep an eye on.

## Red with Anger

*^(/u/kungfukenny_br)*

Internacional start the 2024 Brasileirão feeling the pressure of a long title drought. Even though the team started the year well, with a 12-game undefeated streak, the team was eliminated in the semifinals of the Campeonato Gaúcho, marking the eighth year in a row without a trophy. The national competition  might be a chance of redemption for Internacional, as the team has the most number of second place finishes at the current format of the Brasileirão, with 4. Maybe this year might be the one Internacional supporters have been expecting for so long, as the team hasn’t lifted the Brasileirão trophy since 1979. After the team was eliminated at home in the semi-finals of last year’s Libertadores, the management decided to bring as many quality players as possible, to give the team the tools needed to finally bring home a much expected trophy.

The main problem identified by many journalists and supporters in 2023 was the inability of the team to maintain a high level of play during the 90 minutes of a match. The downgrade of quality between the starters and the bench was the main concern for the team management. Fernando Reges (from Sevilla), Rafael Borré (from Werder Bremen) and Thiago Maia (from Flamengo) are 3 of the many players Internacional added to the team.

Founded in 1909, Internacional are known as the ""People’s Club"", as it was founded by two men (the Poppe brothers) who were denied entry to Grêmio (Internacional’s biggest rivals) as they were not of German descent. The goal of the club was to accept people from all nationalities, hence the name of the club: Internacional. Also, the club was the first in the Rio Grande do Sul state to accept black players, in the 1920s.

**Starting XI** | [(4-2-3-1) Rochet; Bustos, Vitão, Fernando Reges, Renê; Thiago Maia, Bruno Gomes, Wanderson, Maurício, Alan Patrick; Enner Valencia.](https://i.imgur.com/RZjUaJK.png)
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | Since the creation of the modern Brasileirão, in 1971, Internacional is the only team which won a championship having no losses during the whole campaign, in 1979.
**Familiar face** | **Enner Valencia**, who scored 3 goals at the 2022 World Cup for Ecuador, will be the most recognisable player for foreign followers at the Internacional's team.
**Star of the show** | **Alan Patrick** has been the ""brain"" of the team since his arrival in 2022. After his great season in 2023, he was elected to the ""Best XI of South America"" by the Uruguayan newspaper ""El País"".
**Wild card** | There's a lot of excitement with the arrival of **Rafael Borré**, as he was an important part on River Plate's 2018 Libertadores win and Eintracht Frankfurt's Europa League trophy won in 2022.

**Predicted Finish** | 20th

## The Underdogs from Silent Hill

*^(/u/suigamsim)*

Juventude, being from the moderately-sized city of Caxias do Sul, never managed to build a huge supporter base, as it is also around 130 km (80 mi) from Porto Alegre, where the more traditional Grêmio and Internacional are located. Mainly for this reason, Juventude is a team that holds one of the lowest budgets in the Série A, a fact that only makes its comeback more impressive. The team comes from last season's miraculous campaign in the Brasileirão Série B where it started in 19th place with 5 losses in 6 games, and ended at 2nd place with the help of manager Thiago Carpini, who left for São Paulo after the end of the season. However, Juventude is definitely not a newcomer - after being Brasileirão Série B champions in 1994, the Papo stayed in the Brazilian football elite for 13 years in a row, also winning its biggest trophy, the 1999 Copa do Brasil against Botafogo in an overcrowded Maracanã, against all odds. Juventude, from its humble history, is a legitimate underdog, but don't let that undersell you the strength of the team. The fact that it manages to survive in such a suffocating environment, against better teams and all possible odds, is a testament to its resiliency and tradition, with a fanbase that did not leave the club even in its darkest days.

After its relegation in 2007, Juventude went through a huge downfall, facing multiple relegations and even struggling to secure a spot in the Brasileirão Série D in 2013. But they're back for a reason - it's a team that knows when to be clutch, especially in knockout games. And along with that, Juventude has a mystical effect when facing other teams, especially due to its stadium, Alfredo Jaconi. Caxias do Sul is a city located in the Brazilian South within a mountain range, and as such, its cold winter and its fog are very common elements in Juventude's games. Many teams with a budget hundreds of times bigger have succumbed to the ""Brazilian Silent Hill"" in games that are nearly inexplicable, such as Corinthians' 6-1 defeat in 2003 where it was completely impossible to see the ball with the amount of fog, or Flamengo's 1-0 defeat in 2021, where the rain was so strong that the game was dubbed as a ""water polo match'' by anyone who was unfortunate enough to watch it. 

After coming back to the Brazilian elite, Juventude need to prove themselves as worthy of staying there. This year, they managed to secure a deal with online casino Stake for the biggest sponsorship in the club's history, and the money is being used in a responsible way for a solid squad - enough to reach the Campeonato Gaúcho finals against Grêmio. Juventude mostly rely on Nenê (yes, former PSG player Nenê!), Alan Ruschel (survivor from the legendary 2016 Chapecoense team) and Gilberto's expertise, but they have a plethora of young and upcoming players who are willing to prove themselves. The prediction is that their defense will be its strongest component as a lower budget team, with quick countering using its midfield players. Juventude are also a team that tend to be very strong on corners and free kicks, as they will use Nenê's crossing and shooting skill to their advantage in these moments. When Nenê is not around, Juventude also have Jean Carlos, a very strong (and hot-headed) free kicker.


**Starting XI** | [(4-2-2-2) Lucas Wingert; Danilo Boza, Zé Marcos, Rodrigo Sam, Alan Ruschel; Caíque, Jadson, Jean Carlos, Nenê; Edson Carioca, Gilberto](https://i.imgur.com/WHe1EX5.png)
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** |  Juventude-Portuguesa, in 1997, was the least-watched game in Brasileirão history, with 55 spectators. The reason was that both teams were already out at this point and the match had to be played away from Alfredo Jaconi as it was not approved for knockout Brasileirão matches at the time.
**Familiar face** | 42-year-old **Nenê**, the former Alavés, Monaco, PSG and West Ham player, has been a Juventude player since 2023.
**Star of the show** | **Nenê** is Juventude’s leader, adding quality to set pieces and bringing in finishes from outside the penalty box.
**Wild card** | **Caíque** is a pressure-resistant defensive midfielder, with a strong physique and good tackling.

**Predicted Finish** | 2nd

## On to a dozen and one?

*^(/u/Sunny_Ember)*

After a year of turbulence throughout 2023, 17-year-old wonderkid Endrick took the wheel and flew Palmeiras to expand their record as the biggest Brasileirão winners in history, now with 12 titles - and even in the post-2003, double round-robin era, with 4, tied with archrivals Corinthians. It’s hard to imagine how the Academia is going to look throughout the season. For the first few months, Endrick will still be in green, but as soon as he turns 18 in the middle of the year, he’s off to Madrid. On the other hand, club idol Dudu, whose injury triggered the rough patch that lead to Palmeiras’ upset elimination in the Libertadores semi-finals, is set to return around May.

In search for their first three-peat in history after failing in 1968, 1974 and 1995, Palmeiras fans are split between those who believe in another season of piled trophies and those who hope for a restructuring of the team with eyes on the 2025 Club World Cup. Both camps, however, are more than happy to see new midfielder Aníbal Moreno, fresh from Argentina’s Racing, who fared very well in the Campeonato Paulista, as well as young Flaco López, who was the Campeonato Paulista’s top scorer.

Club veterans such as Weverton, Gómez, Zé Rafael, Raphael Veiga, as well as Dudu, have formed the team’s core since the 2019 season and remain as the most reliable pillars for Palestra. The former Brazil goalkeeper has been criticised since the loss of the Supercopa Rei to local rivals São Paulo, though he remains the man of confidence for most fans as well as manager Abel Ferreira. Newly called up for the Seleção, Murilo has also been praised for his solid role in both the club’s defence as well as his support up front with deadly headers.

The 2024 season may be unpredictable for Palmeiras, but you can never rule out the possibility of a trophy or two ending up at Allianz Parque while Abel Ferreira is around.

:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | In 1967 and 1968 the Brasileirão was living a transitory period from a knockout into a mixed format. Due to this, there were two tournaments held in those years and Palmeiras won both in 1967, being the only double-champions in Brasileirão history.
**Familiar face** | **Gustavo Gómez** is the former Milan defender.
**Star of the show** | **Endrick** has undeniably world class potential; **Dudu**, however, has been Palmeiras’ face during their recent winning ways.
**Wild card** | **Flaco López**. The young Argentine forward has staked a claim at Palmeiras’ starting XI with his imposing aerial prowess.

## Can your team handle the Mechanic Sausage? 

*^(u/Night3njoyer)*

Bragantino come from their best campaign in Brasileirão history, finishing the season in 6th place with 62 points. The team enjoyed a solid season, reaching second place and finding itself in a comfortable position to challenge for the title with seven matches to go amidst Botafogo’s breakdown, but performances dropped in the final stretch.

Founded as Clube Atlético Bragantino on January 8th, 1928 in Bragança Paulista, the team enjoyed a golden age between 1989 and 1991, winning the Campeonato Paulista and finishing second in the Brasileirão, before hardships came. In 2019 the club made a partnership with the company Red Bull and, after being promoted to the Brazilian elite, the team rebranded itself as Red Bull Bragantino and changed its crest. Since achieving promotion again to the Brasileirão, Bragantino haven’t been relegated yet and contested the Sudamericana finals in 2021, losing to Athletico Paranaense.

Bragantino have been promoting investment in young players, having the second-lowest average age from the competition, and, under the command of manager Pedro Caixinha, the club seeks to always dispute the highest positions in the table as well as to reach the late phases of CONMEBOL competitions and the Campeonato Paulista. Bragantino’s play style is based on ball possession and pressure in the opposition’ side. Recently Pedro Caixinha has been using the formations 3-4-3 or 4-3-3 to value the exchange of the ball between the players. Bragantino often use the sides to build their plays and most of their goals happen in long passes to the penalty box.

**Star of the show** | **Eduardo Sasha** was the top scorer of the team in the last season and in this season he already have made almost half of the club’s goals.
**Wild card** | Right-winger **Helinho** joined Red Bull Bragantino in 2020 from São Paulo and has since then stood out for his positioning and free kicks shots.

## Roller Coaster of Dreams and Dilemmas

*^(/u/gordori)*

After a 2023 full of happiness, culminating in the unprecedented conquest of the Copa do Brasil, the last major title missing from the club, 2024 began with a promising feeling, as had not been seen around Morumbi for a long time. São Paulo just didn't count on finding itself in the midst of a butterfly effect that undermined the planning for this year.

By leaving São Paulo for the Brazil national team, Dorival Júnior threw the Tricolor into the search for a new coach, and the young Thiago Carpini, with a promising season in 2023, was chosen. Carpini's early work was very positive, breaking negative streaks and winning titles against major rivals, but the coach's inexperience soon began to show and the team now faces a lot of distrust after poor results and even worse performances.

Between the end of the 2023 Brasileirão and the beginning of the 2024 edition, São Paulo lost its main defensive reference, Lucas Beraldo, as well as his partner on the left side, Caio Paulista. To strengthen the team, good names arrived at the tricolor such as wingers **Ferreirinha** and **Erick**, Paraguayan wonderkind **Bobadilla**, and forward **André Silva**. They join the idols **Calleri**, **Lucas**, and **Luciano**, as well as the star **James Rodriguez**, and the team now has a more experienced and higher quality squad than in many past years, however, under Carpini's guidance, the impression that supporters have is one of much turbulence along the way.

**Familiar faces** |  **James Rodriguez**, yeah that one! A player who carries a high level of expectations among the supporters but has yet to show the stardom he carries.
**Star of the show** | **Lucas Moura**, of Spurs and PSG fame, helped the club winning the Copa do Brasil and displays good performances — when he's not injured.

## Sailing Through Stormy Seas

*^(/u/LavaGhoti)*

It’s still crazy to think that I’m only writing this because of a [Serginho late winner against Bragantino](https://youtu.be/4PIaRtol4qM?si=R7gtSPhOyeMH-a9_&t=100). To say that Vasco da Gama’s 2023 Brasileirão season was a roller coaster of emotions is, quite frankly, giving too much credit to roller coasters. A win against Atlético Mineiro away deceptively kickstarting what would be a *disastrous* first half of the season boasting a 15-game winless run with an abysmal 11 losses in a row. The club’s fifth relegation was deemed as inevitable even before the halfway point. However, clinical mid-season signings such as Payet and Vegetti, coupled with a change in leadership in the form of Ramón Díaz, heralded a massive course correction against all odds, turning this sinking ship into an actual football team. But four games without a win in the last 5 fixtures meant that it would all come down to a [final fixture relegation battle for the ages.](https://twitter.com/geglobo/status/1732601059267199078)

Founded as a rowing club in 1898 by Portuguese immigrants, Vasco da Gama has enjoyed both national and international success throughout its history, the crown jewels being four Brasileirão titles, one Copa do Brasil in 2011, and one Libertadores in 1998, the 100th year of the club’s founding (and hey, also my own birth year!). Though ever since winning the domestic cup, the club has had precious little to celebrate, with more participations in the Brasileirão Série B than in the Libertadores since, and successive periods of financial mismanagement leading to a desperate sale of the club’s footballing operations to controversial owners 777 Partners, all the while rivals Flamengo and Fluminense collect silverware. Through it all, Vasco’s supporter base, among the largest in the country, yearns for the day these treacherous waters can be left behind.

And the one in charge of steering this ship through the 2024 Brasileirão season is none other than “Don Ramón” himself. Argentinian manager Ramón Díaz enjoys nigh-unprecedented goodwill within the club as a bona-fide miracle worker, following last season’s great escape, and it truly feels like as long as he’s at the helm, things will be fine somehow. That being said, a lackluster January transfer window still leaving gaping holes in the squad, and a disappointing but not entirely unexpected semi-final defeat over two legs to Campeonato Carioca dark horses Nova Iguaçu show that there is still considerable work to be done to make it smooth sailing from here.

**Starting XI** | [(3-4-1-2) Léo Jardim; Paulo Henrique, Gary Medel, Maicon, Léo, Lucas Piton; Zé Gabriel, Pablo Galdames, Payet; Vegetti, Clayton;](https://i.imgur.com/nYugGGl.png) 
:-:|:--
**Fun fact** | Vasco is actually Pelé’s boyhood club, as stated by the King himself in several interviews.
**Familiar face** | All eyes are sure to be on what Vasco’s star player **Dimitri Payet** will accomplish this season, after last year’s trial by fire. Even during an underwhelming (by his own admission) half-season nonetheless marked by his two incredible individual winners against [Fortaleza](https://youtu.be/DxGzkMGLyn8?si=EwiRRku1cLg_dfY_&t=83) and [América Mineiro](https://youtu.be/mmqQYXu17HA?si=P75ySXWz1wUpuO0Y&t=144) which proved to be vital in that relegation scrap, the veteran Frenchman quickly fell into the supporters’ graces. Now, after losing weight and returning with proper fitness levels during the pre-season, already delivering some genuinely eye-catching performances this year, and generally being happier than ever at the club, Payet will surely be looking to repay the sentiment in full during this Brasileirão.
**Star of the show** | I was half-tempted to just say Payet here again back when we all started writing this guide, but turns out **Leonardo Jardim** had other plans. Originally brought in as a second-choice goalkeeper last year, Léo Jardim quickly earned earned his spot on the first team, and from there, proved himself be the one truly untouchable piece on this Vasco squad, being arguably its most consistent player since his debut, which is doubly impressive considering the defensive players he relies on tend to be the most inconsistent. The prime example of this would be Vasco 1-1 Nova Iguaçu, in this year’s Campeonato Carioca semi-finals’ 1st leg, seeing a whopping 14 saves by Jardim in a match that Vasco frankly had no business having only one goal scored against. No doubt performances like that culminated in Léo Jardim’s recent call-up to the Brazil national team following Ederson’s injury news.
**Wild card** | New arrival **Juan Sforza** (aged 22), from Newell’s Old Boys, has what it takes to clinch his starting spot in the squad’s midfield.

## The Lion King

*^(/u/vvv4231)*

Vitória come strong from a dominant season at the Brasileirão Série B, in which they finished first with a seven-point advantage over second-place Juventude. Finishing first in the second division has been a good omen in the past few years, with four of the previous five clubs to do so remaining as Brasileirão sides to this day (the fifth one being Chapecoense in 2020, which would have a record low 15-point Brasileirão season the following year). Vitória followed it up in 2024 with a Campeonato Baiano title over City Group-backed rivals Bahia, ending a six-year drought at the tournament.

This top-flight appearance marks the end of a five-year spell away from the Brasileirão, the longest for the club since the 1970s. From 2019 to 2023, the team unusually struggled to rebound quickly from the 2018 relegation, staying twice in the Brasileirão Série B midtable and eventually being relegated for only the second time in their history to the third division, then achieving immediate promotion and going on to have the aforementioned 2023 title campaign. The club claims as its best Brasileirão campaigns a second-place finish in 1993 and a third-place finish in 1999.

Vitória brought in no less than 21 names to strengthen their squad for their return to top-flight, including the likes of former Milan players Cristián Zapata and Luiz Adriano, former Rey de América recipient Luan and Inter Miami’s Jean Mota. Vitória were able to retain Wagner Leonardo, elected the 2023 Brasileirão Série B’s best player by GE journalists, reportedly refusing a €2.5M offer from Russia for him. With this many reinforcements to the squad, Vitória are still very much a work in progress, and it should take manager Léo Condé a few matches into the league to figure out his best starting XI.

**Starting XI** | [(4-3-1-2) Lucas Arcanjo; Zeca, Camutanga, Wagner Leonardo, PK; Willian Oliveira, Dudu, Rodrigo Andrade, Matheusinho; Osvaldo, Iury Castilho](https://i.imgur.com/ycDXyhF.png)

**Fun fact** | In 2012, Vitória partnered with the local blood bank, incentivising blood donations by starting with a kit with white stripes that would gradually turn red with the volume of donations made. The campaign saw blood donations at the blood bank raise 51% in its duration.
**Familiar face** | **Cristián Zapata**, formerly an Udinese, Villareal, Milan and Genoa player, and **Luiz Adriano**, the former Brazil international and Milan player, are the side’s two most recognisable players internationally.
**Star of the show** | **Wagner Leonardo** is a lanky left-footed centre-back and was the great highlight of the club’s promotion campaign back to top-flight.
**Wild card** | **Fábio Soares**, a 19-year-old left-winger, is the Vitória academy’s most promising player, with a reported €50M release clause for foreign clubs.","117","vvv4231","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1c3rym2/the_definitive_guide_to_the_2024_brasileirão_part/","**The OP has marked this post as Original Content (OC).

"Catching your (red and) white whale: Olympiacos FC road to European glory!","2024-05-31T15:47:45+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1d4ys4g/catching_your_red_and_white_whale_olympiacos_fc/","The 29th of May 2024 in OPAP Arena (colloquially *Hagia Sophia Stadium*), the 2023-24 Olympiacos squad entered the club's history by winning the Conference League and becoming the first Greek club to add a European trophy in its collection at senior level (after doing the same at Youth Level a few weeks ago)!

***Brief history lesson for the class:***

Olympiacos is historically the emperor of Greek football. ***47*** league titles vs ***41*** for every other team *combined* speaks for itself. But European glory has always been the club's white whale, the goal that was never scored, the one thing missing from the club's myth. There are many reasons for this oddity:

* a mentality that ""the 1st is everything and the rest are nothing"" which led to trophy hunting always being prioritized over deep European runs.
* a team which usually played without much focus or investment in defense (Giovanni and Rivaldo up front, Anatolakis CB is a great example) because its main objective was to break down park-the-bus Greek defenses.
* the club never had the stars align in Europe (which is also needed if you aren't a big league club).

Europe was the only lifeline of Olympiacos' enemies in years of red and white domestic rule: they had memorable moments from Europe that Olympiacos didn't. They also used it as an argument that Olympiacos' local dominance is based on corruption and in Europe, where there is real refereeing etc., the true strength of the club shows.

***Zooming in the last years:***

Marinakis bought the club in 2010 and immediately achieved domestic domination. He brought back Ernesto Valverde, whose football philosophy affects Olympiacos until today, and the club stated regulary getting 9 and 10 points in CL until 2016. A combination of reasons led to a decline of quality and 2 lost titles until Pedro Martins put the team back in a order.

Εuropean success kept eluding though: despite some great wins, there was always a circumstance putting an end to the European journey - luck, Marinakis firing the coach for ego reasons (Jardim, Bento), GK blunders, covid changing the season, or simply a weaker team at the given moment.

In 2022-23 Olympiacos had a horrible season and Marinakis changed everything in the summer: you can read in details my post from August [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/16a2t13/17_in_30_out_how_a_titleaddicted_club_reacts_to_a/).

***Since then:***

Did you read it? Good. Now throw all the planning and philosophy which was in theory put in place in August out of the window.

It didn't work. Diego Martinez improved the team and quality was added in several positions in attack and the wings, but the defense was vulnerable, the midfield was understaffed, and it went down the drain in November: the defensive performances against Greek minnows at home (despite wins) and the draw against Backa Topola (!) was the warning bell, and the hammer fell against PAOK at home (2-4) and Freiburg away (5-0). These results are not acceptable for Olympiacos under any circumstance, especially heavy defeats from other Greek clubs, and in early December, Martinez was fired with Olympiacos finishing 3rd in an EL Group with Freiburg, West Ham and Backa Topola with 7 points but having only 1 point in 3 Greek derbies.

But it gets worse: Marinakis hired Portuguese journeyman Carlos Carvalhal. He ""fixed"" the defense by positioning the players to sit back which led to not scoring against Lamia, Atromitos and Panathinaikos (twice), the players disliked him (Podence was visibly not even putting an effort) and the season looked lost, with PAOK having a 9 points lead in early February, the team out of the Cup to Panathinaikos and unable to win any Greek derby, much less think of Europe where Ferencvaros was waiting. Carvalhal was fired 1 week before the 1st leg match against Ferencvaros.

Marinakis is impulsive, arrogant and confrontational, and these traits led to the demise of the red and white stranglehold on domestic titles. But he is also very stubborn and really, really hates losing.

Changing 80% of the team didn't work? Let's do it again then in January!

Out go:

And this time...jack-pot!

These transfers transformed Olympiacos for the best. Carmo is a 10 times better CB than Freire and Porozo combined. Chiquinho and Horta are quality, modern midfielders which complement the wonderful Hezze who was fighting alone for months next to unprofessional Mady Camara, and give a role to veteran Iborra in a midfield of 3. Martins gave much needed depth in the wings that Solbakken and Biel had failed to do. Abbey gave depth to the CB position. Navarro was a flop but you can't have it all.

The key to turning a wasted season to a glorious one, the missing piece of the puzzle, was the 3rd coach of the year: **Jose Luis Mendilibar**.

The fans were furious with Marinakis, his entourage, and the players, and there was no enthusiasm when Mendilibar arrived: his EL trophy was treated as a fluke, like Di Matteo's CL because ""Sevilla can win EL without a coach"". His work at Eibar was disregarded as ""it's a small club, what does he know about having to win every week"". His debut was to be against Ferencvaros....

**Here. We. Go!**

1st minute of the match, Olympiacos defense is sleeping as usually and the Hungarians score. The new coach is destined to fail already, just like that. But VAR to the rescue: hairline offside! The match is balanced, but Olympiacos with the new coach aura and the January transfers starting to glue with the team find a goal with leading scorer El Kaabi (who had missed January because of AFCON) and the morale shifts.

7 days later, Mendilibar is hailed as the second coming of Ernesto Valverde: Olympiacos have won their 1st derby of the season by demolishing league leader PAOK away (1-4) and played their best European match so far in Budapest, doubling the 1-0 wins against Ferencvaros. The draw is kind to Olympiacos: the next opponent is Maccabi Tel Aviv, everyone's 2nd preference after Viktoria Plzen.

Mendilibar has already flipped the team morale, won the players, had luck in his 1st match and his 1st draw, and the next week he gets 3 more league wins while rotating the squad. The 9 points gap from the top of the league is down to 3, the fans who were asking for everyone's head are delirious, and the expectations for breaking the curse against Israeli teams (3/3 eliminations) are sky-high.

The back-to-earth reminder is brutal. Olympiacos' shaky defense, especially when not protected by a 3rd midfielder, is torn apart by Eran Zahavi, Maccabi scores 4 goals in 5 shots and leaves Pireaus with a shocking 1-4 win.

The next day changed the course of the club forever: against all odds, Marinakis announces (through press leaks) that Mendilibar signed a new multi-year contract. And when the Basque has a tactically bad match and Panathinaikos leaves Piraeus with an 1-3 win a few days later with the crowd booing everyone, Marinakis doesn't change his mind: the message to the players is that the coach isn't going anywhere, start performing.

Was it their bruised ego? Was it football wanting to reward a good decision over an impulsive one? Was it Maccabi thinking they're already through?

The match in Topola (Maccabi used it as ""home"") had everyone rubbing their eyes in disbelief: Olympiacos went to HT leading 0-3! And when CB Retsos gifted a penalty to the Israelis, the psychology shifted back with usually clumsy El Kaabi scoring a bicycle kick (!) and veterans Jovetic and El Arabi completed a mircale in extra-time: 1-6!

The draw was again kind, and the opponent in the 1st QF since 1999 was Fenerbahce (note: Greek clubs and Olympiacos in paticular are not afraid of Turkish clubs. In Greece they are considered as ""rich but not necessarily stronger than us"". I recall Turkish fans here seemed to think Fenerbahce is a club of the size of Porto or Ajax and clear favourites - in Greece they aren't seen like that. It's just the Greek fans and media POV, not an attempt to belittle Fenerbahce).

Until then though, the league campaign suffered a severe blow with an away 90th minute defeat to AEK in a match where Olympiacos was good but not clinical, with only slim hopes remaining for the title. But everyone's mind was in Europe.

Olympiacos entered the home leg pressing the error-prone Fenerbahce defense at every chance they got, and got a 3-0 lead after 60 minutes. But another stupid penalty given by Retsos plus lack of depth which brought fatigue allowed the Turkish team to make it 3-2 and a very close return leg...which started very wrong for Olympiacos, 1-0 down early on. The match ""froze"" for a big part and in the penalty shoot-out, Tzolakis who became starting GK at the 2nd leg against Maccabi Tel Aviv, saved 3/5, including the 5th one by Bonucci, and sent Olympiacos to heaven.

A rotated side managed to beat PAOK at home, dropped points to Aris and beat punching bag Lamia, and thanks to AEK's poor results vs PAOK, the title chase was also still on, with 3/3 wins in derbies needed.

Nobody was focusing on this: Olympiacos has a lot of titles, they can survive losing one. All eyes were on the prize: Aston Villa and the prospect of a final in AEK's stadium!

What followed was football giving back to Olympiacos what they deserved over the years: a perfect referee and VAR referee who didn't give any ""home advantage"" to the ""big league"" team, a perfect finishing night from the striker, and timing, always timing. Aston Villa scored early but the goal was cancelled because on an offensive foul (from the ones referees often miss), and Olympiacos shocks Villa Park in a counter attack with El Kaabi using Cash's heel to beat the offside trap by 1mm! 13 minutes later, El Kaabi doubles the lead with Mendilibar's press doing wonders against Lenglet and Olsen. Villa bounces back though, with a goal at the end of the 1st half (a limping Ortega couldn't follow Watkins) and equalize early in the 2nd half with Diaby catching Tzolakis by surprise. At this point the match reminds the Yassine Meriah-induced fiasco against Tottenham a few years ago, but this time Olympiacos doesn't crumble. Douglas Luiz gifts a penalty, and El Kaabi (who never misses penalties) completes his hat trick. 10 minutes later, Hezze who had never scored for Olympiacos tries a shot outside the box...deflection, Olsen doesn't react quickly, 2-4! Villa press a lot but tactical freezing of the pace and Luiz sending a penalty to the stands send Olympiacos back to Greece with the 2-goal lead.

In the week until the 2nd leg, reporters and English fans had started an irrational hype about Emi Martinez returning....forgetting that Villa needed 2-3 goals and a goalkeeper, even an elite one, doesn't really help much in that.

In a flaming Karaiskakis stadium, El Kaabi says thank you to Podence and Quini serving him a tap in on the counter and Villa has a mountain to climb and neither the stamina nor the morale to do it. Iborra and Carmo dominate the air, Retsos avoids his usual catastrophic error per match, Tzolakis is there when needed, and Villa has more or less the pointless possession that Spain's NT had in the World Cup.

El Kaabi puts the cherry on top with an identical VAR-verified goal: everyone believes he's offside, but a defender's heel keeps him onside. 2-0 and the dream of every Olympiacos fan (and nightmare of AEK and not only) is reality, final in Athens!

The league title is lost against a spirited and focused PAOK 3 days later. The club really wants to screw AEK for many reasons (mostly because of a fat Slovak referee gifting them a win in January in Piraeus) and beat them at home, sending the title to PAOK's hands. The domestic season ends with smiles after drawing Panathinaikos from 2-0 down and securing Europe for the next season.

The final is recent so I won't go into much detail: in an expectedly tactical and close match, Olympiacos made the dream come true in the way that the last 2 months went: El Kaabi goal in 116', dancing on the offside line, and VAR confirms that for the 3rd time he managed to find the millimeters separating glory from defeat!

Olympiacos caught their Moby Dick, lifted a European trophy in a season which was borderline disastrous for several months, filled haters with despair and fans with ecstatic joy and changed the club's history forever.

***The golden team of the club, by order of matches started:***

https://preview.redd.it/argksj27vq3d1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba929943966b48c707dc10dda899b8179e09094f

https://preview.redd.it/nvmla979vq3d1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f1a574583d8fc9968af7f2dd2ae8a4fbd610f7

**Rodinei:** The best RB seen in Greece for many years, Rodinei is what Olympiacos fans dream from wing backs: a player with the technical skills of a no.10, who fearlessly runs forward and terrorizes opposition defenses when matched with Fortounis. He does leave gaps behind and isn't tactically very aware of crosses from the other side, but if he did that he would be in the Premier League. He almost became the black sheep when Livakovic saved his 5th penalty, but thanks to Tzolakis this moment cost nothing, and it would have been a huge pity for Rodinei. A cornerstone of the triumph!

**Hezze:** The soap opera tranfer of August was worth every second of waiting. Hezze started running in the summer and never stopped. A tireless athlete with the stamina of a long distance runner, the tactical awareness and tackle timing of a modern DM/CM, who held the midfield by himself every single match until February due to poor transfer planning, who also always has the clarity to pick the prime option when passing. The 22 years old Argentine was a hidden gem who shone very brightly once competent players played alongside him in the midfield, and got his personal reward as well with a goal in the Semi and the assist to the title-winning goal! Several European clubs are greedily looking at him, but there is the feeling that Marinakis is not going to sell him this summer.

**Retsos:** The most controversial player of the squad throughout the season. Retsos is an amazing CB 90% of the time, with an excellent ball-playing ability which made Leverkusen spend almost 20M for him when he was 18 years old. The other 10% of the time he has brainfart moments which usually lead to goals. In several matches throughout the year, he ruined his own excellent matches by giving an easy penalty or getting a red card or losing the ball where he shouldn't. He also had the bad luck to not get away with any of these errors - almost everything got punished with a goal while mistakes of others didn't end up in goals. This resulted to a lot of social media hate, peaking after the home match against Fenerbahce when his needless penalty kickstarted the return of the Turkish team in the tie. Nevertheless, he was still the 2nd best CB of the team and managed to not let his rollercoaster season affect him negatively in the final sprint, performing flawlessly against Villa and Fiorentina. If he stops the brainfart moments, he will become the best Greek CB ever.

**Fortounis:** The team captain lived a moment legends of the club were dreaming of. After 2 ACL injuries and a falling-out with Pedro Martins, he proved to everyone that he can make the difference at European-level pace, he can cover his wing back effectively (a chronic weakness of him), he can combine his lethal through balls with playing from the side and not strictly as no.10, and that Gustavo Poyet commited a crime by not having him in the national team (he rated Bakasetas more, lol). Fortounis gives solutions when matches get stuck, he opens the defenses and his creativity is a tool Olympiacos relies on so frequently that it's often taken for granted. He deserved this moment maybe a bit more than the rest. Top assister of the season!

**Paschalakis:** The starting goalkeeper for most of the season, dropped before the 1-6 against Maccabi. An old style keeper, with a huge body, very good reflexes, but with terrible ball-playing abilities and afraid to leave his line to clear crosses and corner kicks. Which was the reason, in parallel with the 7 goals in 3 days conceded to Maccabi and Panathinaikos, that Mendilibar changed him with Tzolakis. He had spectacular moments when the team wasn't well and there were many threats for the defense and accepted the secondary role in the end of the season with grace.

**El Kaabi:** Another amazing story reaching its climax. El Kaabi arrived in the summer with a career in Morocco, China, Qatar and one season in Turkish minnow Hatayspor. Noone was enthuiastic about him, and despite him quickly proving how easily he scores, there was still a lot of criticism about his limitations to control the ball and ""break"" it to the side and the fact he wasn't as technically skilled as prime El Arabi. His month in AFCON coincided with the team failing to score in many matches, and from February onwards he became an Olympiacos fan's dream of a striker: he was there in every single big match, finishing almost every one-touch chance he got: with his head, his feet, even a bicycle kick! He was what was expected from Tiquinho, from Oscar Cardozo, from so many bigger names who have passed from the team and never managed to be at the right spot at the right time as often as El Kaabi. 16 goals in Europe (2nd scorer of the club, in his 1st season!), 33 in total, 11 in 9 matches in the Conference League. 2 against Ferencvaros, 3 against Maccabi, 5 aganst Aston Villa and the golden goal of the final. That's an Olympiacos CF, the one the fans demand and rarely get to see. Clinical, always on the right side of the offside trap, present in big matches, 0 injuries. A player with an unremarkable career became a hero at Olympiacos and his name known in all Europe. What a story!

**Masouras:** When Olympiacos is struggling, Masouras is always there to fight and give solutions. When the team is rolling, he stands out negatively more often than not because he lacks the technical skills and quality a winger needs. Masouras became a bench player in the last 2-3 months and added his own part in the road to the title, as one of the clubs oldest players.

**Ortega:** The 2nd Argentine August arrival was the starting LB and had a lot of ups and downs. Tactically he isn't at the level he should be and makes it up with fighting spirit, technique and overlaps. He isn't Hezze, but covering the position occupied by the (hated by almost the entire fan base) talentless Reabciuk for 2 years, he had something rare: time. The bar was so low that there was patience to give him time to acclimatize and develop. As the rest of the team, he stepped up when it mattered and his 1st season in Europe ended ideally!

**Podence:** The short legend! When he got sold to Wolves, Olympiacos suffered for years, unable to find a winger of his quality. From players who are usesless without open space (Bruma), overweight players (Rony Lopes) to downright joke players (Onyekuru) and players who didn't give a shit (De La Fuente), everyone failed miserably to replace Podence. His return was greeted with joy and he showed why he is loved and was so hard to replace: the team's best dribbler, he improved his weak finishing in England (2nd scorer and 2nd assister of the season), he loves Greece and the club and gave everything he had most of the time (apart from his falling out with Carvalhal), he has a character and and an ego, he wins a lot of fouls, he is a tiny demon messing with every defender. He scored the 1st goal of the miracle against Maccabi, a screamer against Panathinaikos, he served on a silver platter to El Kaabi. Him, Hezze and El Kaabi were the summer transfers who changed the image of the team the first months.

**Mady Camara:** The less said, the better. An ungrateful, selfish player who believes he deserves to play in a bigger league and a bigger team, reluctantly stayed after Roma (and nobody else) wanted to buy him, chose to try hard only when he was personally interested, and was iced out of the team in January for refusing to renew and get sold, opting to leave as a free agent. Enjoy watching your teammates celebrate from your sofa, Mady!

**Ntoi:** An academy product, 20 years old, Ntoi was a DM in his youth career and was turned to a CB by Michel last season. He has good and bad qualities, not ready to be  a starter for a team playing a high line but giving it all in Istanbul when he was needed in the return leg. He was the 1st bench option at the position for most of the season and he is with Tzolakis and Retsos one of the academy players who wrote their name in the history books with the title.

**Quini:** In Olympiacos, when you are a more limited player with a role to offer solutions from the bench, you are either a fan cult figure of a lightning rod for blame and hate. Quini zigzagged between the two, and his step-up when it mattered the most was one of the X factors. A veteran RB with a career in Segunda, he was asked to play LB often (thank Richards for being always injured) with mixed to poor results for most of the season. But with Ortega out against Villa, he had to step up for 3 halfs against the 4th PL team's wingers, and step up he did. He managed to limit the threats and assisted El Kaabi in the return leg to seal the presence in the final. Everyone played a part!

**Chiquinho:** Among the January transfers, he was the less flashy. Unknown to most people, the bar was low given the multiple failures of the last years when buying players from the Portuguese league, he soon proved everyone wrong and was one of the 3 January signings who turned the season around. An all around midfielder, playing both at no.8 and no.10, controlling the tempo and rushing forward when needed, with Hezze and Horta/Iborra he changed the way the midfield worked and turned the tide. He came with just 500k euros!

**Carmo:** Perhaps a 15M CB is what is necessary for Olympiacos to have a decent defense. Carmo came on loan from Porto in January and showed from his first game that he would be a season-changer. Strong, dominant and confident, he became the leader of the defense and changed the fate of the club. His block in Fiorentina's chance in 121' was his personal rubber stamp to a season his arrival turned around. Porto's asking price is high, but there's hope Olympiacos will manage to keep him. Best CB after Ruben Semedo and without criminal tendencies. He is worth every euro.

**Tzolakis:** Among so many stories, the one of Tzolakis is the greatest. The 21 years old goalkeeper was second for most of the season, with his performance in a few matches in previous seasons being lukewarm. Mendilibar made him starter before the return leg against Maccabi, valuing his quick thinking and skill to play with his legs and come out of the box when needed, and nobody could image what would follow. The young GK played with the confidence of a seasoned veteran, had flawless matches against Maccabi and Fenerbahce and became the ultimate hero in Istanbul by saving 3/5 penalties! From there with morale sky high, he was a rock until the end of the season, with 2 clean sheets in the 2nd Semi and the Final, and from another young prospect who was thinking of leaving to find playing time, you're looking at the starting GK of Olympiacos for years to come!

**Alexandropoulos:** The former Panathiniakos youngster on loan from Sporting scored one of the most crucial goal of the seasons: the equalizer against Genk in early August when half the squad hadn't arrived yet. His contribution came in the less flashy part of the season, but it was just as valuable. He didn't find much playing time the last months since Mendilibar preferes technically skilled midfielders and he's a bit clumsy, but if he stays there's a lot of room for improvement.

**Horta:** A technically artistic albeit a bit soft CM, Horta gave much needed solutions and filled the midfield of Olympiacos with quality and simplicity. Releasing pressure from Fortounis and Podence, sometimes from the bench sometimes as a starter, Horta was another missing piece of the puzzle which fell in place. He also put the nail in AEK's coffin with 2 goals which took the title out of their hands!

**Navarro:** You can't have 100% success in January transfers. Navarro is not a great goalscorer, he can't do much against parked buses, doesn't have the positioning of El Kaabi or the skill of Jovetic, and it's frankly a mystery why Porto values him at 8M.

**Iborra:** Extreme makeover, football edition. Iborra in a 4-2-3-1 system looked like a geriatric dinosaur, unable to follow the pace, slow, tired and generally useless. Mendilibar saw something in him though and when he changed the system in a 4-3-2-1 with both Hezze and Chiquinho alongside him, the 36 years old Spaniard turned to a leader in the pitch: calm, methodic, dominant in the air, he was a different player and lifted his 5th European trophy, with significant contribution to it!

**Biancone:** A rather mediocre CB with no attributes to make him stand out, he played in league matches mostly before March.

**Jovetic:** The Montenegrin veteran stayed away from injuries, with the correct usage (coming from the bench), and proved his quality: technique, experience and big moment goals, with the 5th against Maccabi his highlight. Everything you can ask from a substitute forward!

**Carvalho:** A meme player who cost the Greek Cup with a missed 5th penalty, mediocrity and lack of mental strength, a Mendes plant who made a career with almost zero skills to play anywhere above Rio Ave.

**Biel:** A player completely unfit for the brutal environment of Olympiacos. He rarely managed to show his talent, he cracked under pressure, he doesn't fight back but his performance takes a nosedive if things go wrong. Shipped to Augsburg in January.

**Richards:** The medical center's permanent resident, he showed flashes of quality, but what's the point if his body is made of glass?

**Freire:** A wrong transfer from the start, a mediocre player, error prone, not a great match with any of the other CBs, left in January. Night vs day compared to Carmo.

**Gelson Martins:** A proper winger, with acceleration, dribble and threat to the defense. Not in the European list because only 3 changes were possible in January, but he rested the starters in the league and is a big hope for the next season as long as he stays healhy.

**Porozo:** Average, never justified the hype, not worse than Freire but his lack of an EU passport led him to being ommitted from the squad more often than not due to league rules, and left in January.

**Solbakken and Scarpra:** Flops of the season. Came with much fanfare and high expectations, and offered nothing. We're still waiting for a player coming from Forest to be in the ""good"" and not the ""mediocre"" or ""bad"".

**Abbey:** A prospect CB who came from Reading in January, showed raw talent in several matches and will play more next year.

**El Arabi:** A club legend says goodbye in the best way possible. At age 37, he couldn't have the role he was used to, but what better way to close his career in the club? His last game was the winning final, his last goal was the 6th against Maccabi Tel Aviv. With 20 goals he is the club's top scorer in Europe, in the top 10 scorers overall, and the most talented all around CF seen for at least a decade. Thanks for everything!

**Vezo:** A Mendes transfer, probably in a silent deal to bring us the good Portuguese alongside. Didn't play much, not sure what his level is, he is no Carmo though.

**Vrousai:** Academy player, on loan to Rio Ave to find game time.

**Cabral:** He got injured at the only part of the season where he could have found minutes. Came as an extra solution for Greece, can't say we saw it.

**Brnic:** Started the season strongly but with Podence's arrival he couldn't find space in the squad.

**Apostolopoulos:** Academy player who debuted with the first team against Aston Villa! Mendilibar proved he isn't afraid at the slightest with his debut.

**Ramon:** I forgot he played. One of our many mediocrities out on loan.

Apart from the obvious (the title itself), Olympiacos won the chance to change the next years for the club as well: the direct spot in the next Europa League league phase means a proper pre-season without qualifiers. It means planning without must-win matches in the summer.

The club completes 100 years in 2025 and Marinakis was already talking about the EL Final in Bilbao!

Can only hope my club has a moment and a season like yours again soon Excellent post all-around, a fit and proper description of what would become the best season in our soon 100-year history. It still feels unreal that just one year after we were being trashed by Haifa and Qarabag that we would beat Villa and Fiorentina and win our first ever European title. Keep it up!  Also something last about Carvalho, regarding his meme status. He was a starter at Mendilibar's first match against Ferencvaros and someone in the Olympiacos subreddit posted about beginning a road to final with him as a starter, and then he became something of a cult hero (although still, he never stood out in any match he played and was in general painfully average) This is a wild journey.

"Juventus' Douglas Luiz and Alisha Lehmann have £416.000 worth of watches and jewellery stolen during buglary at their home in Turin","2024-10-20T20:23:00+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1g883px/juventus_douglas_luiz_and_alisha_lehmann_have/","[No textual content]","1959","TheElevatedBoy","https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-13980877/Juventus-power-couple-Douglas-Luiz-Alisha-Lehmann-416-000-worth-watches-jewellery-stolen-burglary-home-Turin.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=social-twitter_dailymailsport","Got to ask what Nani was doing at the time... 400k worth of watches and jewellery is obscene Probably Motta trying to recoup some of the wages Dougie has been stealing whilst over there, from reports I have heard. In all seriousness though, I'm glad it was just a robbery and nothing more, scumbags. ""Footballing couple Alisha Lehmann and Douglas Luiz reportedly had their home burgled in Turin on Saturday night.  Both joined Juve in the summer and they have now become the victims of a [crime](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/crime/index.html) in their new home, according to [Gazzetta dello Sport.](https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Juventus/20-10-2024/douglas-luiz-post-partita-shock-svaligiata-la-casa-rubati-orologi-e-brillanti-per-500mi.shtml) The burglars are believed to have stolen 11 watches that belonged to Luiz as well as some diamond necklaces of Lehmann's.   Luiz was playing in the Old Lady's 1-0 victory over Lazio on Saturday night while the robbery took place and returned to find his house in a mess.  Alisha Lehmann and Douglas Luiz reportedly had their home burgled in Turin on Saturday night  [](https://dailymail.lnk.to/its-all-kicking-offDM!dw)  Lehmann, meanwhile, was at a hotel with her team-mates, leaving the property empty.  The report adds that the alarm was raised at 1.30am with police and forensics teams arriving to the scene.    It is not the first time this has happened to a Juventus player in recent years with Moise Kean, Kaio Jorge and Angel Di Maria also suffering the same fate.""  Sorry for the paywall link. Also burglary* Imagine moving from Birmingham after 5 years, only to find that you’ve ended up somewhere even more unsafe… That’s quite the accomplishment. and still, the bigger robber is douglas luiz for his wages That's why I only keep $4600 worth of jewelry and watches in my home in not Turin... Proactive wealth redistribution Only in Naples they say... Buy watches and jewellery for 400k and pay 0€ for security, brilliant. The frequency with which players' houses get burglarized in Europe is bizarre DM me if you're looking for expensive watches and jewellery at competitive prices. Obviously you shouldn't have your things stolen, but if I had a spare £400k I wouldn't even spend a penny on watches and jewellery.  I see so many footballers walking around with ridiculously flashy chains, watches, and jewellery, and it always looks tacky and low class. Canadian here.  Was wondering what the big deal with £416 was but totally forgot some of you guys use a period instead of a comma.  Also that doesn't even look like Alisha with all the makeup Is this the same woman that tried to scam IShowSpeed into buying her a very expensive watch? and I felt guilty when I bought my 45€ Casio (A700WEM-7A) £416 ain’t too much Everyone's talking about security, and nobody is talking a safe. That hidden metal box that's designed to keep small expensive things secure. It's come to the point where clubs should probably give basic security lessons that take 20 mins to stop this totally preventable nonsense. I only feel bad for the feeling of unsafety they are going to experience.   As for the money, fuck it lol   There has been no class in the history of humanity that is more overpaid than Entertainer during the capitalism era, at leat per average.   Some random midfielder in a top-6 team in the PL is banking millions per year without even playing a full 90min for 6 games in a row lol. Must be shit being famous (I’d take their money though of course)  Edit: I worded that wrong, it wasn’t me I swear One Instagram post each damn I swear I’m gonna find a 3rd post where the money will be in dollars What an absurd amount of money to have spent on watches and jewellery.  About a weeks wages combined I'm sure them flossing and flaunting said jewelry on social media isn't connected in any way. Probably let all their ""fans"" know their whereabouts as well. Just asking to get taken advantage of. The Bling Ring in Hollywood comes to mind. Not that I support burglary and that kind of shit, but football players having hundreds of thousands worth of fuken stupid watches and jewelry is one of the obvious reasons why they get their homes assaulted so often.  Also, always see them getting their homes burglarized with the same kind of luxuries stolen, yet somehow they don't spend a dime on additional private security? Like, WTF, I know they aren't usually known for their brilliant minds, but if I earn that amount of money per week I'm 100% getting a freaking fortress-like security whenever I'm playing a game or going on a vacation. The real question is did the robbers steal an equal amount of jewellery from each of them? Because if they stole more from him than her, then that's blatant sexism I wonder if their insurance is covering these losses or why won’t footballers just hire security firm guarding their houses 24/7. They have money to do so. They know that they are targets and buglaries happen very often. Don’t care what sour fans have to say about the guy, no body should have their possessions taken from their own home by a thief, regardless of their wealth.  And on the man himself, it’s a massive transition to a big team, there’s always gonna be speed bumps along the way, but Dougie is world class, just needs the right treatment from the club and fan base to get behind him and he will start running the show. From the sounds of things it sounds like Dougie is having a rough time in Turin. Sometimes feel he was the sacrificial lamb for FFP. lol she talks to Luiz about the pay disparity. I’m all for equal pay for women in most jobs but something based on skill is not one of them ie soccer/tennis/golf etc unless they bring in the same revenue streams as the men’s. And this is the same girl who turned down a team place in the last World Cup. The only reason she’s in Turin is that Luiz wouldn’t move without her.  She’s not even a good footballer but trading on her looks to maximise her revenue. Don’t get me wrong..there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that..but you can’t then complain about pay parity when you don’t put in the same effort. Imagine Alisha Lehmann complaining about equal pay - 2 month later she lose jewelry worth 500.000 euros. Pour Soul... 415500 of this was Luiz jewellery and they also took the 500eur smartwatch she had £416k worth of watches and jewelry. This world is disgusting. They should both genuinely be embarrassed. Do something good with your money you privileged goons It kind of is their fault. They know owning these items will make them a lot higher risk of theft by serious criminals, but do it anyway.   It’s their choice. So about 3 weeks’ wages worth? Good. If you own a half million in jewelry, fuck you. Was one of them begging a streamer for a watch? 400k on jewelry, surely he could afford a security guards around his house. if you have 400k of watches and jewellery shouldn't you invest in safe / protection ? These people need to hire better security if you have that much watches/jewellery in your home Lol rekt Oh no! Anyways... Oh no… anyways.. Why do they have this. Seems like a really difficult start for luiz at juve. We've had a few juve fans come on to the villa reddit and ask if he's actually good. (When he's single, he'd fucking incredible).   His transfer saved the club a points deduction and he was refusing to sign a new contract, so he had to go, and him leaving has led to youri tielemans becoming our best performer this season. But I feel a bit bad for him should have stayed in Birmingham, safer probably Damn, my heart bleeds for them Why tf do people keep watches and jewellery in the house anyway there’s safes and banks worldwide to keep this shit in [removed] I get the feeling footballers seem to not think about spending money on security. People on regular wages have security cameras. Footballers seemingly have no security Some footballer complain about match fixture congestion.   Some have 400k in jewelry laying around. “Don’t go play in Brazil it’s dangerous” lol Put it on the passengers seat, rolled off the window, and drove away. for them it's like buying candies or like paying for water bills for us. it's a different world. Knowing how some athletes shop, I wouldn't be surprised if the 400,000 was comprised of a few blinged out AP's and an ugly RM. Those would be something along the sides of 2,5-3k for a normal earning person, considering Luiz grosses 5,5M. Crazy proportions. yeah i’m having a real hard time caring. disgusting levels of wealth are a scourge Yea, for real. I only have like 275k jewelry at my place at any given time. It's fucking absurd when you think about it that this is where we've ended up as a species. I watched an interview some years ago with Justin Kluivert, he shared that he was on his way to own 50 houses. All to rent out to the plebs. It’s a weeks wages? Not exactly. Some highest end luxury watches can cost that much each or more.   It's obscene to 99% of the world, but in the watch community that could equate to a small burglary. Watch them resell for 50k That’s like two things is it? thats like two luxury watches and a couple of chains Could literally be 1-2 watches btw actually jewellery especially good watches aren't that bad investments tbh  IF it won't get stolen ofc, lmao Or one Richard Milne Probably only 200k, but you know, insurance claim It’s one month of salary. It’s like an average person gets stolen watches and jewelry worth 1500 euros … [deleted] My first thought exactly. I find sympathy difficult for the “loss” despite how horrendous having their privacy violated is. its like 2 watches and a chain 🎻 Probably a week’s wages. Nothing really. Considering their income it really isn't On a more serious note, while this event was unfortunate, it’s an outlier. Compared to Birmingham, Turin is still safer. Crime rate and the severity of crime is general is lower in Turin than in Birmingham.  Edit: Added, “On a more serious note”. I heard he wasn’t that bad? Has he been ass? He's good, tbh. Very technical and will not lose the ball. 2 horrendous mistakes, yes, but still not that awful. That’s why I keep my £80 smart watch on me AT ALL TIMES. You never know where the snakes will be Robin Hood 🤌 must neapolitan thiefs, obviously... i cant but help think the same thing everytime one of these stories breaks. if i was super rich i would live in a luxury condo with 24/7 security and key card access. hell, thats my goal even if im only moderately successful in life Nobody ever accused a footballer of being smart. In a lot of these cases, the security is paid off.   Source: Auntie Jackie’s sister’s brother’s boy is a criminal Nah not much more often than other people houses, especially when they’re rich. It’s just you won’t see in the news that some random dude’s house was robbed, doesn’t get the clicks. Rich people spend on jewelry mate, look at the watches and the Cartier stuff on the women That’s your choice, others make different choices, you trying to seek moral high ground is stupid.   The thing is if you had 400k spare, Douglas Luiz has more than 400k spare to buy the things he wants. But £400k is just over a months wages for him. Footballers are usually from low class and they are more often than not pretty stupid.   I know a few professional footballers in Sweden and they are all incredibly stupid. They don’t even earn a lot of money but they still act all rich and elite. Will be interesting to see what they do after their careers because they won’t have earned enough to live comfortably for the rest of their lives. Bruh if I had a shit ton of extra money I’d spend it on ludicrous stuff too after growing up without being able to get whatever I wanted. But you bet your ass I’m giving back in time and money too. What about a spare £4m though? Would you spend any of that on tack? Now that I think of it, maybe I should've just wrote 416k. Couldn't remember what the article used so i went for the dot. There are three zeros after it so it wouldn't make sense to be 416 Scamming IShowSpeed actually sounds great. [deleted] [deleted] Don't know how people are down voting this . You can be a football fan and simultaneously think they are disgustingly overpaid At least on match days, it should be completely logical to have your house guarded.   It's pretty sad that you have to do that, but footballers have an absolutely public daily routine and are known to have a lot of money in the form of jewellery in their homes. i'd understand hating him after causing two pens, but the hate for him was there from the moment he moved to turin, not only hating him, but being happy after he is stolen and calling the robers robin hood? very wierd obsession. Your jealousy is showing and it's pretty sad what the fuck What does one have to do with the other? Objectively yes would be insured aswell, so unless any of the items have sentimental value, not much lost financially for them. You spend a few weeks salary on candy?  It isn’t like that. For Luiz yeah. But for Lehmann thats like 2 years of her salary Not really. Nobody’s buying 5 weeks of salary’s worth of candies. 400k is still a good amount even for these folks because they have a lot of other expenses too. Someone stole my laptop, backpack, and iPad last summer. Relative to my salary, that was probably worse financially for me than this is for them. I can't imagine Alisha is paid enough to buy 6 figures' worth of bling. Tbf footballers tend to have really nice watch collections it’s not the same at all. percentages only tell one side of the story. it does not materially impact his life. the average person can’t afford an unexpected $1000 bill. he will not go without anything.  5 million?? How did Juve agree to this? He is a working man just like us, he did not exploit anyone to get his wealth. He just happened to be incredibly lucky to be good at one of the highest paying jobs in the world Wahh, man spends his earnings dictated by supply/demand in a way I don’t like, wahhhhh I imagine he'd have just used daddy's money to do that if he wasn't a player anyway. But why he still wants to do it despite earning more than enough is beyond me. Or does he just collect them like some people collect stamps? More like a month for him.  For her, it would be 2 years. No way its a week wages. Checked, its more than a month wages, Douglas Luiz makes €96k a week For him maybe definitely not for her They’re not investments, they’re a hobby TBH i think they buy them because other rich people, especially newly rich athletes, buy them and that's what they think they're supposed to do Nah they're terrible investments. They were only good for holding when supply was low and demand was high post-covid but since then most watches have plummeted in price on the secondary market. Somehow makes me sympathetic to communists because I cannot imagine possessing this much wealth at any point in my life Sorry for the joke, never would have made it if I knew the comedy police were in town. well, that depends. I support Inter, to me they're not paying him enough, but in the general objective opinion of the mass calling him ass is an insult to a donkey It's clear he's not a bad player, but he just looks lost on the pitch. Can’t comment on Turin but in Birmingham and probably most cities in England outside of London, the super rich don’t generally live in apartments or condos. It’s more so seen as where people live if they can’t afford a proper house.  [I believe this was the house that he used to live in at some point in Birmingham. It was either this one or the one next door to it](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/153950003) It does make it easier when you know their schedule. There's a lot of rich people who don't spend anything on jewellery. Footballers seem to though. I'm not making it a moral thing. I'm saying it's a class thing. Even if I had infinite money I wouldn't spend any of it on jewellery. I've seen some of the gaudy crap that many footballers choose to buy, and it looks awful and cheap. The only Jewellery I'd ever buy is an engagement ring and wedding ring.   Many footballers come from very poor backgrounds. Often when people are poor growing up and then come into money later in life, they will spend it on ostentatious displays of their wealth. Big shiny Jewellery seems to be a favourite. This is their cultural signifier of wealth. It's why footballers are often the target of burglars. They're very likely to have things of insane value just sitting around the house, like Jewellery.   Compare that to many of the people who *own* the football clubs. They are *way* more wealthy. Actual billionaires. Do you ever see any of them wearing giant chains or flashy labels? Their clothes will be expensive, but understated. Do you think they'd have hundreds of thousands of pounds worth, or even millions in jewellery just sat around? Of course not. Look at you on your high horse. Yes I'm sure I'd spend it on some stupid stuff too, but it wouldn't be jewellery. There's a million other things I'd spend it on before that. It's genuinely right down near the bottom of the list for me. I just read it quickly. Didnt see the third 0 at first.  Saw the period first British actually, and it’s a joke A good safe (that footballers can afford) built into a wall. How exactly are you going to open that? Organised gangs want to smash and grab. A safe is not smash and grab. It cannot be smashed ( well, good luck). I highly doubt they have lock pickers amongst them able to crack a proper safe.  Failing a safe, common sense says put valuables in the least suspecting place like behind a boiler or something. Too many of these robberies are due to expensive items probably just lying around or in the top bedside drawer. Wtf does overpaid even mean lol? As long as someone is willing to pay him that money it's apparently what he's worth, otherwise he wouldn't be paid that sum. Nobody has money to just give away Nah, there’s being pissed off/annoyed that a player for you hasn’t hit the ground running, but you can’t HATE them, and then there’s derogatory personal attacks and borderline racism which is just not something any club should want their fans to be like. Oh look, another temporarily embarrassed millionaire kissing wealthy feet Yeah keep licking the boot buddy , you might see a penny of it one day ( N B you won't) They make too much money to complain  Maybe. The psychological toll of not feeling safe in your own home after being broken in is immense, though. Not necessarily. Would insurers cover 400k worth of watches for a footballer? Would cost a lot of money if they would and there would probably still be a large excess to pay Insurance doesn’t cost any money? News to me.  If a week of my salary is what an average person makes in a whole year, then sure. It’s not linear If i have enough money that I know that I will never have to think about money again, yea, then I would spend a lot my money on candy(candy here beeing luxury stuff, I dont want Diabetes ) Cos she only earns money from her playing salary. She's sponsored by a bunch of other companies. She makes bank off her arse. Do they? I feel like most of the ones I see are tacky Richard Milles and iced out Rolexes that look like shit. and worst case he will just hire security or move into a gated community if he feels too unsafe in his own place. a regular person doesn't have those options either. I'm going by memory but if I recall well Juve spends something along the lines of 7M before taxes on his position. He was the big name for the midfield, along Koop. keep fighting the good fight buddy! one day the market's invisible hand (that becomes eerily visible whenever rich people or corporations need it) will elevate you to be rich like that as well! All her money comes from instagram or sponsors and they pay well as well She has 17m follower on instagram. She probably makes more than he does. She definitely makes more than him lol He makes more than that. He made more than that with Villa. Was on line 120k a week gbp. So he probably is on like 150-180k They’re not a hobby, it’s just grandiose consumerism. Fishing is a hobby. Watchmaking is a hobby. Depends on the pieces. There’s a market for them that fluctuates up and down. It’s not like cars (most depreciate over time) Pateks are pretty much always going up That’s okay, I’m not throwing the joke out or anything and I’m sorry if it came across that way. I’ll edit my initial comment to make the intention clear. What have they done to my boy, I wonder how they are setting up because he wasn't the same even for us without kamara next to him. Lmfao  >calling him ass is an insult to a donkey. He’s played nine games lol. Makes me curious how bad he could be to warrant this. He was our best player along with Watkins last season. Genuinely looked like a good champions league holding midfielder. Sad to see. And they tend to have a lot of jewelry and expensive clothes and things that are easily sold Yeah, both being footballers is a problem! Feel like footballers particularly from South America don’t really come from generational wealth so they feel the need to flout the wealth they build through football more than some English lord would. Not that I have any taste for the flashiness but it makes sense when you contextualise the backgrounds some of these guys are coming from. They can be sound investments though >Do you think they'd have hundreds of thousands of pounds worth, or even millions in jewellery just sat around?  Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the team he Luiz plays for had a watch collection which included 1 watch that recently sold at auction for over €7m.   Rich people have rich people shit. Stop believing this ""wealth whispers"" bullshit. >Compare that to many of the people who *own* the football clubs. They are *way* more wealthy. Actual billionaires. Do you ever see any of them wearing giant chains or flashy labels? Their clothes will be expensive, but understated. Do you think they'd have hundreds of thousands of pounds worth, or even millions in jewellery just sat around? Of course not.  Did you somehow miss the gigantic mega yachts these clown ass billionaires buy? The insane private jets getting to be the size of commercial airliners? Half of them competing to see who can have the biggest mini city on yacht with helicopters and diving boats and whatever the hell else.   What's flashier than a boat that costs hundreds of millions to billions and is the size of a small village? And they're absolute money pits to maintain.  But since you've been conditioned to think billionaires are somehow ""classy"" rich people, you ignore the myriad of evidence they spend money much more flashily so you can shit on people who buy watches and convince yourself that if you weren't broke you'd be one of the ""classy"" rich people. You do realise every billionaire and majority millionaires have broken laws, treated people like absolute shit to amass their wealth. bro thinks he’s the main character Financial income ≠ societal worth. > Nobody has money to just give away  Manchester united paid 80m for Maguire.  Edit:  comon guys, it was a joke.. agree, i said that i would understand it, but never justify it Sorry...another what? Such a low life, get a grip and do something yourself, you’re acting as if they stole your family inheritance. They are paying insane taxes on those wages. It's not their fault the governments don't use it properly.  And there's nothing fucking wrong with buying a nice watch. Once you get an AP you'll have a different opinion of yourself and what have you achieved in life. Actual mouth spiders would have contributed more intelligent commentary. Hopefully they have 416k of security systems. I'm sure they would cry while browsing for their next mansion to move into So maybe instead of buying some shinny toys they should spend this money on a security guards? It's a sunk cost. You pay it regardless your stuff is stolen or not. It doesn’t matter. Luiz earns her net worth in a years salary. Sure that number might not be all that accurate but there’s still a massive gulf CR7 is the only one I see with tacky iced out watches.   Most of the Prem footballers have collections full of factory AP/Patel/Rolex.   Haaland, Rice and Kane spring to mind as having really nice collections. masturbating middle-aged men are a huge cash cow All her money comes from ~~instagram or sponsors and they pay well as well~~  her butt No she doesn’t She makes more than a 500k a month? In Italy we always talk about wages after tax, he makes €96k after tax (that's a lot for Serie A standard) Fishing is also expensive as hell, or so I hear but most footballers don't buy good pieces, they buy ugly overpriced shit with a logo Collector/rare cars don't depreciate and there's definitely a market for them that's way more lucrative than watches They'll always go up until they don't. Tastes change, for decades antique wood furniture always went up and was considered a low risk investment, and then the market for it completely crashed. They go up. But not nearly as much as a simple index fund. He just can’t handle the pace and physicality of serie A I’m pretty sure our set-up doesn’t involve causing penalties by bumping into other players like an ox. He's not that bad - just the classic Juve thread started by a Napoli flair and filled with Inter flair comments.  He's been disappointing but the exaggeration here is biased as fuck. He wasn't the same player when Kamara got injured. They’re poor investments, you pay for labour, overheads and margin of whoever you bought them from. Buy actual metals and gems if that’s a concern. Well their investment just got stolen.   Could have invested that 400k into a high interest savings or investment account, would be a much sounder thing to do. I'm sure plenty of banks would love to have a footballer depositing fat cheques every week, would give you a favourable deal for sure. Why tf are you getting downvoted I don't know why, but I keep seeing the other commenter's perspective a lot lately, it's almost like propaganda when it starts circulating social media.   The key words triggering a memory were that bit ""expensive, but understated"". I'm not even sure where it comes from or what the source of this biased tripe even is, but as you pointed out these people are owning islands and yachts while presenting a ""formal"" look, and somehow it works... Multi millionaires spend upwards of £25,000 to transport their vehicles for a drive around Monaco with their rich friends, and then spend another £25,000 transporting it back.   lol “flashy chain” or ring, they are above that. >Did you somehow miss the gigantic mega yachts these clown ass billionaires buy?  They at least have some utility and function. Jewellery doesn't really have any, except maybe a watch. But you're right, people who have insane wealth also spend it on stuff I wouldn't buy, but what they spend it on is often indicative of class. Clothes and Jewellery is not where billionaires spend. Have you seen the photos of Bezoz? I know he's jacked now, but he doesn't wear much other than a simple black shirt and jeans. Would you ever see him with a gaudy chain on?   Yeah I am broke, but I know what I wouldn't spend money on if I had it.   >But since you've been conditioned to think billionaires are somehow ""classy"" rich people, you ignore the myriad of evidence they spend money much more flashily  I didn't say they were classy, I said it's indicative of class. That's very different. Many footballers come from poor and working class backgrounds, and I think it's pretty obvious that culturally the signifiers of wealth in that strata of society is big jewellery, ridiculous cars, and labelled clothing like Gucci, YSL, and Louis Vuitton stuff.   For billionaires, or people who already came from money, the show of wealth is about where you live, how you travel, and the people you know. You don't *wear* your money, but you live it.   Did you ever read The Great Gatsby in school? It's classic old money Vs new money. Gatsby as the new money is ostentatious, and the old money isn't, or at least isn't in the same *way*. Yes. Don't see how that changes my point about how people display their wealth. no one cares about your ""societal worth"" only how many others can and are willing to do your job Yeah but nobody gets payed based on their societal worth. That's not how the world works Thats crazy money, a bit more and you could get someone like Antony Yeah whatever makes you feel better as you wake up at 6am to earn 1% of what these people make in an hour buddy. If it makes going to work easier for you to believe this then sure bud . These people have spent more on jewellery than money you will earn in a decade . Actual intelligence is retiring with generational wealth at age 30 instead of complaining and destroying your body. If you have 416k worth of security systems and this still happens to you I doubt it makes you feel any better Moving does not magically remove the trauma this inevitably creates. This isn't how anything works, not even for obscenely rich people. Remember kids, money makes every single problem go away. Rich people are pretty much a different species from the rest of us, they deserve no sympathy. Honestly, if you're ever unhappy while you're rich, it just means you're stupid How are you lot making it their fault? Lol, bitter mentalities like this are why we progress so slowly as a species. So when your things get stolen, the insurance company doesn’t increase your premiums? That doesn’t sound right.  Assuming half of that is her's, 200k is hardly gonna be a big deal for someone as popular as Alisha.  Like a quick Google search says her networth is close to 5 million. you don’t know what influencers make apparently. it can easily be a lot more than 5 million.  Apparently she gets paid like 300k per branded post on instagram. I don’t know how true that is but if it’s anything close to that she’s making bank. Only if you're a gearhead that think you need everything. Huh? You don't like diamond bedazzled Richard Mille where you can't even tell what time it is? High end watches and high end cars have similar dynamics. There are some cars that you can only buy if you’re a VIP, and that car is instantly worth a lot more than you pay for it if you get it at RRP. Similar with high end watches, some watches you can buy from a dealer and sell it for double the next day. Sure but in this case they are. It's not taste. There's no trends here. Absolutely. Nobody is arguing that Pateks are the best investment out there. i think it's the fact theat he caused 2 penalties in two consecutive games without doing anything exceptional in any of the games.  but you're right, it's way too early to judge him Luxuruy items can increase in value, it depends om what you buy… Not the safest maybe, but there are a lot worse options They're good investments if you are at high risk for being arrested...or so I've heard The jewelry will be insured lol Idk, I guess all those people with valuable and smartly selected watch collections have been wrong all these years Yeah, the biggest source I've seen is the ""rise and grind"" and ""millionaire mindset"" type social media influencers who are always pushing these inaccurate memes about rich people getting rich focusing obsessively on saving their money and other nonsense. Dude, he built a 50 million dollar clock into a mountain. So a slave has no worth? That’s how you view the world? Awful grim. So what? Just because we’re broke in comparison means they don’t deserve their money? Lol But they didn't steal it from me. They earned it by making someone rich even richer.  Just like I do. Just like you do. It's just that I don't cry over it. I take my money and I buy nice watches for myself rather than cry when some dude online does the same thing at his level. True > money makes every single problem go away.  It does lmao. If you leave your doors unlocked someone is gonna walk in. If you're multi-millionaires with $400k to blow on excess like watches then you can afford $50k/year to hire a security guard. Pretty true tbh, I’m a high earner and money solves 99 percent of my problems. Lazy to clean? Hire a cleaner. Bored? Go to a west end show etc. I do deserve less sympathy than someone who earns less than me, and I hold the same standard for those who earn more than me too It's not their fault but like, wtf dude, we're in a global recession. The rich don't get breaks and when shit hits the fan, the people resort to stealing and killing to survive. If they want to feel safe in this world that we live in, either invest your wealth into social programs to prevent theft or simply hire more/better security. ""not much lost financially"" =! ""Nothing lost financially"" Losing 1/10 of your wealth is kinda significant (i have -300k net debt) It's taste. Today luxury watches are considered a classy fashionable status symbol by the rich, which is why they're valuable. Maybe in a century that will still be the case, but who's to say that in ten or twenty years that position as a status symbol won't have been replaced by something else, and luxury watches will be seen as old fashioned or tacky or whatever else. Oh trust me I have had my moments of rage about those penalties but I am just trying to be objective as well.   He arrived late, out of shape, needing to adapt to a new league and we’ve had only a very small and unfortunate sample of his abilities. A clock that's built to run for 10,000 years. It's not a random bit of decadence. It's a science project to see if humanity can keep a clock ticking for 10,000 years with minimal energy input and simple mechanisms. It's trying to extend the hand of today into the far future. Can you imagine if we had working mechanisms from 10,000 years ago? They'd be the most treasured artifacts on earth.   It's also a hell of a lot cooler than buying some random lump of shiny gems. What slaves? Thankfully those are illegal. And thankfully we have minimum wage to stop wages for unskilled labour going through the floor Correct . Douglas Luiz does not deserve the amount of money he makes Please tell me how money cures terminal cancer...If it makes every single problem go away, why are miserable rich people a thing? https://www.reddit.com/r/CarTalkUK/s/xzYH4d26Fv  You are a real high earner. Yeah these burglaries of footballers homes in Europe is done by poor people just looking to trade those stolen goods for a loaf of bread.  I saw cctv images of one of those burglaries and the perpetrators had 9 children with them and made them a meal in the kitchen because they hadn’t eaten for days.  Same with the sex trafficking. It’s only done to just get by in the recession.  You moron. Because insurance companies are famous for paying out any and all claims, and not fighting them for months or even years.  Except.most of the watches and jewellery can still be an investment and depending on the type of product still hold or rise in value Are you aware of the market for Patek?  What you are saying is generally true. Nobody is denying it. But the Patek market is very bespoke. But no one can steal it. Think about WHY those laws are there.  We do care about societal worth. Dudes getting benched by Weston Mckennie lol > why are miserable rich people a thing  Because you get rich by hyperfocusing on one thing, be it acting or sports or music. Then, when your time has gonna and you age out, you're left with millions and a giant gaping hole in your personality since your entire life was that activity. You don't have any real friends, since they were just there for the money and association. Look at Pogba. Some stay in the field, some find other interests.  If you're not wealthy you have to be omg a well rounded person, and all of your problems can be solved with money. If you're rich, you never want for anything, but you have no personality outside of the thing that made you rich.  All that to say, I'd rather be miserable in my mansion than glowing in my cardboard box on the street. A lot can change in a year, especially in software engineering! Keep licking those boots bud. One day, maybe you'll be rich too Most people don't have lawyers that go through every detail of their legal paperwork to make sure values of contents are all filled and proved properly, also much more costly going after millionaires footballers in court for the insurance company, so it's not exactly the same as denying your average joe who is claiming their laptop is still worth the £2k they paid for it 7 years ago.   What the fuck is your point here lmao what a bunch of pointless snarky comments Jewelry and watches are not good investments at all if you think about using it to fight inflation. I don't know anything specifically about the market for Pateks, but I know no investment can go up forever. I don't care how bespoke a Patek is, at the end of the day it's valuable because people believe it's valuable. There's nothing innate in a Patek making it worth what it is, I highly doubt it tells you the time better than a $10 Casio. A rich guy in the 90s who owned some 18th century mahogany cabinet could talk about the bespoke craftsmanship and history of it, but a decade later it would have been worth a fraction of what he paid because tastes moved. Sure but you just literally described how money does not solve every problem. All you said is that, on balance, being rich is better than being poor  and I don't think many will disagree with that. Dude you could not even afford a kebab two months ago, stop roleplaying. https://www.reddit.com/r/Ealing/s/TdhufMubE2 These boots lmao  they’re rich but they’re not the boots. They’re entertainers. [deleted] He’s trying to setup some 🤓 akshually moment but he’s too thick to even do that Disagree Then maybe you shouldn't comment on things you don't understand.  And it does tell time better than a Casio. I really hope that was a poor attempt of a joke. Let me rephrase. For those of us who aren't rich, many of the cases of our stress and depression are outside of our control. Circumstance, education, place of birth, etc. Money solves all those problems with a snap of its fingers.  With the depressed rich, the onus is pretty much entirely on them. They have no barriers to.. Anything. They can be anything that want. Study anything they want, go into any profession, start any business, travel anywhere, get into any hobby. If you have all that opportunity and access and you still *choose* to mope around at home, I'm sorry, I don't feel a crumb of sympathy for you.  Now, again, it's not entirely their *fault*. Especially things like athletes or musicians who had to pretty much sacrifice everything socially to get to where they are. When they age out/get injured/retired, it's kind of like, ""well shit, now what?"" they have to actually *work* on themselves and form what kind of person they want to be. And that's tough, but heaps easier when you can just try and fail as many times as you want essentially. lol shoot me for still wanting value, go on dig some more since you obviously seem to have nothing better to do with your time Idk what to tell you dude. If you have $400k to blow on watches you have $50k to pay a guard to house sit while you're away.  If I leave the keys to my bike inserted and walk away, when I come back it'll be gone. But I guess common sense is a superpower. [help yourself](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/should-you-invest-in-watches-wine-or-other-luxury-goods/) It doesn't tell time better than a 10 dollar Casio.  There is no mechanical watch in the world that can outperform Quartz. If you're a watch enthusiast like you say, you should know this. When you buy expensive mechanical watches, among the papers you get is a chrono certificate from the swiss chronometer testing institute. Your watch is tested in 5 positions for 15 days. At the end they tell you if it runs fast or slow (typically -4 to +6 seconds per day for mechanical watches). The variation on a quartz watch doesn't exceed 0.07 seconds a day, so a 10 dollar F91w will beat a Patek for accuracy ANY day. How does it tell you the time better than a Casio or your phone? The most expensive automatic Patek Phillippe watches will absolutely not tell time better than a cheap quartz Casio No automatic swiss watch tells time better than an electronic device. A battery powered casio or gshock will tell the time better than a patek This is genuinely such an insane take that I don’t think I can even understand what you’re trying to say or how you think. Depression is the fault of the person because they’re rich lmfao Ok fraud. No thanks Yeah dude, just look at pogba's latest interview where he talks about this exact thing. Rich people depression is all mental issues. Fake friends, impostor syndrome, lack of purpose, etc. It's not my fault if they don't want to spring for a therapist who'll tell them to do what the rest of us do and get a hobby.  I don't have sympathy for them because the rest of us get depressed too. But we don't have the option to just go travel the world or start a business or pick up literally any hobby at the highest level or learn any trade or get any education at the drop of a hat. We have families and bills and jobs and obligations that take priority.  I other words, normal people work through their depression without the same means. Stop fucking moping and buy yourself the best therapist money can buy. [you are my favorite kind of investor then](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/2024/05/01/falling-luxury-watch-prices-time-to-buy/) That’s not what depression is, you’re just describing a depressing life. Not actual depression. You are my favorite kind of who asked"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* That's insane business from Juventus, can't believe Aston Villa have accepted that. Di Marzio was right all along:  https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/vZyTK5ajZb What is Giuntoli cooking holy shit Aston Villa doing a swap deal so that Chelsea and Man City don't get a bigger sell-on fees. Is Sam Iling Jr any good? Iling Jr is an absolute baller, I know Villa fans would be absolutely gutted losing Luiz like that but getting a serviceable midfielder - if you get last season McKennie and not Leeds McKennie- and an absolute gem in Iling Jr is decent business.   As much of an admirer I am of Allegri despite his relatively disastrous second spell with Juve, his management of Iling left a lot to be desired, I think he could absolutely blossom under Emery and turn into 50M type of winger. Juve finally manage to sell McKennie to the prem after years of trying I know a lot of people won’t agree but Iling Jr. has huge potential, been watching him since his Chelsea days (he played with our U19’s when he was 16) and he has all the tools to be a star.  As for Juve: Luiz is a stud of a player and if Motta likes him then go for it.   The McKennie inclusion is the only bit I’m unsure on? I thought Villa badly needed FFP value which player swaps don’t give. Unless this is technically going down as separate transactions in which case Juve/Villa may be getting another knock from the FFP police… Gallagher fund I love Doug, but I don't think he's as irreplaceable as some are making him out to be. Since Kamara went down with injury, I'd have him pegged as one of our biggest underperformers in the squad. Iling Jr will be a breakthrough star of next season Holy shit an actual swap and cash deal?? Feel like they always get rumoured but never really happen Not keen on the deal but Emery has always had interest in McKennie and that man has earned all my trust.   Fucking hate modern fish football though - being forced to sell one of your best players when you're on the up. Man Italian clubs really hose some deals, it’s absolutely insane. Lol arsocca transfer experts in the mud after trying to tell us Di Marzio is a fraud I was not impressed by him against Mexico, lots of side and back slow passes and not much creativity. I was 100% certain this deal would not happen, but I was also 100% certain Grealish wasn’t going to Man City.  Alisha Lehmann to Juve then, heard it here first lads Fair deal for both parties. Mckennie is serviceable. The magic wand of Emery will be crucial, Illing could be a hidden gems that can explode in a couple seasons. He felt too restrained last season, especially. Flashes of brilliance but hard time nailing Allegri's tactics.    EPL will suit Illing more than Serie A, imo.  Villa will win this transfer. You’ll see That’s are good news for Serie a . This has got to be one of, if not the weirdest transfer in modern history This feels like a better deal for Juve Juve masterclass this Insane deal. Cant help but think Villa are making a huge mistake selling arguably their most promising player. Can i understand this as Villa trading their star player for two lottery tickets and 20m? we really not gonna go in for him? Any club turning to Cobham for improvements are rarely left disappointed. Just a shame our own club can’t see that. Watkins maybe gets Pens back? Cheers, Arteta's crying as an american, would be happy to see mckennie at villa. fucking gutted about luiz tho. and know nothing about illing jr Christ, what a dreadful deal for Villa. Horrible trade for Villa - McKennie is nowhere near good enough to replace Luiz As a Spurs supporter I couldn’t be happier to see them swap Luis for McKennie hahahah DiMarzio is a big fraud. He said that rice to city was done last year. Don’t fret Villa fans. This has rattled me and I'm no Villa fan. I don't see Juventus appeal at all these days anymore. Weird transfer kinda. McKennie is garbage lmao [deleted] Good profit for us, we was going to lose him for pennies two seasons ago and need to sell now Luiz is absolutely quality, Juve have done well there. Some of Villa’s best performances this season have been without Luiz on the pitch.  If they *really need* to sell for FFP reasons, this could be the best out of a bad situation for them. I actually think Villa have got the better deal here   Luiz was in the last year of his contract, Iling-Junior has loads of potential, and McKennie’s limited but a decent enough squad player Monchi tend to be good at hidden gem/surprised signing so who know They have to, because of FFP, dumbest rules I’ve ever seen FFP, here you go. Forcing rising clubs with potential to sell to their death I have to apologize I wasn’t familiar with his game in terms of this transfer, other times he’s just wrong. We should never doubt Italian Journalists when it comes to Serie A transfers. he's only got good info regarding Serie A clubs and sometimes Chelsea. It's rather obvious. I don't even understand how juve is doing a swap deal. In order for them not be traded at book value, they need to be independent transfers. 0 chance a judge believes thats the case here...we will get in trouble again for the same thing. Does that even work? Surely they're just treating this transfer as like 60m euros received for Luiz and 40m paid for the two players, especially where they need to make profit in the current period for FFP Don’t they need money though?? He didn't play a lot because allegri preferred kostic over him, but when he did play he was pretty good, and he's still young Hasn't shown much but neither did other attackers. Allegri being the main reason of course. He's only 20 years old and has a lot of potential tho He has good pace and dribbling. His passing and shooting need to improve. He’s young with good potential. Feels like an attacking winger more than anything else. Has been a bit inconsistent but the talent is clearly there (and he’s improved on some of his weaker areas (defending, build-up play) since he first came through. Really didn’t want to lose him and believe he can easily become a world class player, he’s always come across as having a really good mentality too. Watch clips of his very first Juventus game, you'll think he's insanely talented. Then look at the rest of his season highlights. Going forward he didn't have confidence (or direction from management) to take on defenders. He mainly played to maintain safety going forward. He's got a lot of talent underneath if he's in the right frame of mind and an attacking playstyle. He is very skilled in attack. He definitely isn’t where he needed to be defensively to get regular minutes for Allegri, but many Juve fans always rated his abilities on the ball and his pace A very direct player, with good sense in the final third. I liked him quite a bit. Wish juve weren't selling him but the need in midfield is much greater so I get it. he will be a 70m player in 1-2 seasons in the prem Can confirm that he's great on career mode. Not sure if it answers your question but I got him up to an 87 He is good and so is McKennie. This deal only looks like this because for some reason Premier League players prices are inflated and players from other leagues, especially Italy, are deflated.   This is the case even though Italy spanks England in International play whenever it matters.    Just politics I’m guessing. Yeah Illing is like a hidden gem, not many are aware of his talent because he didn't get the chance to shine under Allegri but the boy has potential. I think he could do very well after a year in the PL. Yeah, he’s very clever for a young player as well. Great dribbler and is smart in the final third.  20m for him is still great given he is out of contract next year e He’s still a bit raw obviously and living under the Allegri regime didn’t do him any favors but I couldn’t agree more; he has everything I want out of a fullback Would he play more on the left or right with Villa? we were lucky we failed last summer. He was crucial this season and did very well. Pleasant surprise for everyone Looks like Frattesi's sister better learn English I'd put money on that we are doing an Arthur/Pjanjic style ""trade"". Villa also need depth and flexibility to deepen their squad ahead of a UCL season with more games and pressure  Getting a decent rotation option that can play multiple positions + a promising English winger + some cash to put towards future transfers makes sense IMO.  Emery is a monster in European competitions, I trust he knows what they need heading into next season. Fingers crossed. Is Gallagher linked to Aston Villa ? uuuuugh I am sure emery has a plan He deserved a chance to focus only on offence. Allegri ruined him. Should be given time as a pure winger to see if he can kick on. He was great when he first joined the first team. !remindme 9 months This is always going to happen until the revenue catches up. For example our match day revenue is shit, people hate Heck but he’s come here to increase our revenue streams  If you don’t want spending rules then you will just get nations buying every prem club and spending even more than now until they get bored. McKennie was one of the best for us this season, and Iling is pretty talented as well. Yeah he could have been an important part in UCL football too... To be fair the whole team was walking on the pitch against Mexico. But yeah he was nowhere to be found He’s been pretty ass since January. His form completely fell off once Kamara got injured, also our best performances towards end of the season came when he was suspended.  Still love him tough disagreeable correct snow employ north berserk resolute profit distinct disarm   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Depends entirely on how Iling Jr. turns out. It absolutely is, McKennie is a risk, and Illing is a potential future talent. Luiz is a world class midfielder right now, this is a complete dogshit deal for us that we are forced to make because of ridiculous FFP rules to keep the Big 6 as the Big 6. Vila have shown they can play without him and they are getting young winger with great potential and one of the best Juve player last season. And money on top of that. It's not that bad of a deal considering they are forced to sell Not really. He didn’t have an exceptional season at Villa while McKennie was consistent all season and  Iling Jr. still has solid potential. Seems very even to me with both squads taking a risk. McKennie might play like how he did at Leeds instead, and Douglas Luiz could flop without the right midfield partner. Not like we have a choice with these shitty FFP rules, if we dont sell 60m worth of players by the end of June we're fucked. Don’t bet on it, I could see it being McGinn or Tielemans. We don’t know that. People were saying Tielemans was washed and he was great. He will replace Luiz to start the season Someone wanna explain the mass downvotes? Lmao surely can’t all be Villa supporters and/or USMNT player bum boys Douglas Luiz is gonna make you forget about them real fast IMO. We desperately need a player like him. At least we didn't sell him to an Italian club for pennies to then see them turn around and sell them to a PL club for a big profit, as is often the case. Even Dragusin, who was apparently a 'shady plusvalenza deal' according to the FIGC, earned Genoa a €15m profit after one season. If it's true it's frustrating as a Villa fan too. Or he could turn into Moise Kean and end up returning. Hopefully it won’t turn into a Coman or Thierry Henry situation. I expected you guys to reject McKennie and ask for more cash tbh Seems like you lot will be able to record this creatively for financial purposes too since incomings and outgoings are structured differently for FFP purposes. I assume City have a high sell on fee so technically selling him for less than he is worth with the exchanges saves you money as well. Luiz without Kamara next to him isn't the same player. He needs a technical yet hard working foil to do the running for him. That said would I want to lose Luiz no, am I really unhappy about it? Also no. Arsenal away and? He wasn't, he had 2 years left but if its true that he wouldn't sign and new one and wants to leave then I'm at peace with this deal. I don't know enough about Diaz to say if it's a good deal or not, but both Illing (he doesn't convince me) and McKennie (I like him, but seems he was asking for a 5m renew, so no) were at their last year of contract too Ah yes, so much crueler than the old way of allowing clubs to buy and bankrupt themselves to death.  didn't we get in trouble for the opposite - treating what are essentially swap deals as independent transfers to inflate book value? You got in trouble case everyone can see the arthur-pjanic swap was nothing more than cooking the books. I honestly have no idea. But what I do know, is that I want more football deals made out of spite. Apparently they need to sell for PSR reasons Trying to work out why Villa have taken what (on paper) looks like a pretty poor deal.  McKennie flopped in the Premier League and £16m doesn't go far these days. Very underrated on this sub. He's a solid midfielder with a great engine. The way Mckennie was playing this last year was the look of a man traumatized by Leeds lmao. McKennie was the best midfielder for a Juve team that, while bad by their standards and poor to watch, finishes 3rd. I feel it likely that with a midfield space open with Luiz going the other way McKennie will probably start no? Yeah media are saying Emery is a big fan Inb4 emery plays him as a fullback It’s not binary, spending rules or nation states and this doesn’t just limit City & Newcastle.   The system is malfunctioning right now (malfunctioning not broken). Take Brighton as an example, last season (prior to the sales) if Tony Bloom wanted to invest a couple hundred million to build on his clubs stable and sustainable growth, he couldn’t. He could not go to his stars and say, I’m going to build on your level.   PSR/FFP must have pro competitive catch up mechanisms. If you finish X% above your trending average then you can invest $Y.   Villa having to sell one of the people who got them to 4th and the financial rewards of 4th is contradictory to the objective and reinforces a status quo. Probably that the way he plays suffers without a more defensive minded midfielder behind him. We don’t really have one either so if he can’t perform that way he likely won’t be snatching a starting spot anytime soon.   I feel like that’s the thing with our NT’s midfield, we have good options but their profiles don’t seem to click or fit together all that much, maybe a mismatch in roles too with most of them being box to box types as well. This. He needs an engine next to him, but not just a runner. He needs someone technical to bounce passes off to open space but they also need to do the defensive running for him. Kamara was perfect and a huge part of why Luiz looked great for the first half of the season.  I fact you'll also find in the games Kamara had an off one, Luiz and the whole team also struggled. Don’t you have a hotel you can sell to yourself I feel like calling Douglas Luiz world class is too much, maybe I'm underrating him.   McKennie had a very good season for a team that still finished 3rd in a top league, I don't really think he's the risk you portray him to be. McKennie was a January transfer to a club in chaos who played 19 games under 4 managers and was still struggling to get fully fit post Metasara injury the previous season. I don't think McKenne playing like he did at Leeds is remotely likely. There goes my FPL hope Tielemans has always shown quality, McKennie just isn’t good lool mentality doesn’t change that [deleted] He needs a good DM to unlock him. Who's gonna provide that in Juve?  hungry bells cake modern hateful light different roof bright label   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* McKennie had a good season, he’s been better than expected.  Illing is a jewel. could've fleeced Utd so hard if they actually get some money for Casemiro Apparently Emery wanted him for a while this whole thing started with monchi asking after mckennie. Cash isn’t as valuable as usual in this situation as Man City will get a chunk of the profits with the sell-on clause Would love to see him at a better club than Leeds [deleted] I was gonna say most of our best performances were in the first half of the season and Dougie was our best player. In the 3 game period that he missed, Villa played well.  My main point is that Villa certainly don’t look lost without him… and they’ll gain 20 mill + 2 younger players with good potential. Then we will only keep seeing the same big clubs rise to the top and no one can ever challenge them yes exactly that. did i say the opposite? my bad. The way this deal is being described - Illing + Mckennie + 20mio can't be a true swap deal because the reported cash amount is more than Douglas luiz was bought for back in 2019, let alone the differential between the respective book value of the players.   Illing is worth 0 basically on the books as an academy player with 1 yr left, and Mckennie is worth 5.5mio on the books.   I think douglas luiz renewed his contract along the way so i can't be sure about the amortization deductions, but was bought 5 years ago for 16.9mio, so likely has a very similar value to Mckennie.   A true swap deal would just trade them at those values, with the selling clubs making 0 capital gain.  These numbers that being suggested can only occur within the accounting standards if they are independent transfers. Now for all other teams, the authorities likely dont care, but for us its a different story. Yeah as long as they're not inflating players' value ""too high"" above market value, they'll be fine. > can see the arthur-pjanic swap was nothing more than cooking the books.  While your conclusion is correct, your assertion as to why is not. I invite you to read my other comments in this thread to help you understand more. Yeah I know, which is why this guys statement doesn’t make much sense, they need money more then anything Ironically, McKennie has been one of our best players this season I think it's reasonable to say McKennie flopped at Leeds in half a season with four different managers, that's quite different than saying ""in the Premier League."" Rodrigo and Harrison were about the only players on Leeds that looked somewhat okay. McKennie was a Jan transfer, which often goes bad, and may have been still recovering from his injury that ended his season earlier at that point, plus Marsch is a shit manager and Leeds were hardly the ideal place to shine at the time.   He had a good season at Juve and has been good prior, add onto that a good young talent and the money, plus Douglas Luiz having 2 years on his contract and reportedly not wanting to stay, and this seems a perfectly decent deal. Don't know what the rest are saying, McKennie is poor, clearly not good enough for Juve. This looks like a fantastic deal for us. Iling Jr does look like a good talent though. he had a fair few assists too, and with our lack of goals, very important. underrated crosser for sure The only players rated here are the ones playing in PL or Real Madrid Feel like everyone just judged him solely on his failed Leeds stint.  I caught some Juve matches and it looked like night and day for him. PSR is about protecting clubs, it's not a competition equalizer, though lack of regulation would make the top 6 outside of maybe Spurs and Newcastle have a huge gulf between them and the rest tbh.     Anyway Villa have spent a lot and have had extremely high wage turnover, they got where they are by spending to their max or even slightly beyond their healthy means, so they're being limited. That's not a bad thing. Regulations that try to make clubs self reliant is good and healthy.   And idk, they're trading a midfielder who underperformed for parts of the season for a midfielder coming off a good season where he was probs the best midfielder and a talented young winger, I think people are being really harsh on McKennie, I've thought he was a good B2B for years, I know he was ass for Leeds but like Leeds were a fuckin mess and McKennie was struggling at the time to get back to 100% post a metatarsal injury. Frankly I think Villa could end up the absolute winners of this deal, and Douglas Luiz WANTS TO LEAVE and has 2 years left. Sure they could force him to stay but they're not gonna get as good an offer as the one they have rn. You're right. Although Kamara is a hell of a player, Dougie also looked better with Nakamba behind him. He's wasted as a 6 but is a great no. 8 if you can partner him with someone. Only works for the Big 6 sadly. Dude, that deal's horrible, if I understand it right BlueCo now own the hotel, a hotel made to be a consistent source of revenue for Chelsea is now owned by our owners, no longer generating revenue for Chelsea and creating a potentially big problem when the owners eventually sell the club.   It isn't a cheaky PSR get out of jail free card, it's damaging insider trading stripping Chelsea of assets. McKennie just had his best season for Juve. I take it you watch him weekly? There’s literally Juve fans in this thread saying he was crucial for them.  Every player gets a clean slate when they sign for us, especially that reportedly Emery has wanted McKennie for a while If the reports are to be trusted Iling’s being valued at €20M in the deal. That’s pretty good, and basically all profit. ? We’re using him to create a 20m transfer. Thats insane. We also have Yildiz and Fagioli in the first team and Soule probably staying after this transfer.   We’re doing a perfectly fine job capitalizing on our investment. Iling has 1 year left and we’re getting 20m for him If Motta plays the same formation he did at Bologna, I’m imagining him as one of the attacking players in a 3 man midfield. Which probably means Locatelli as a regista / DM. Totally different system though in a 3 man midfield vs 4 man like at Aston Villa. This isn’t really true. He played basically the entirety of this season for Villa without a solid DM beside him (Kamara was injured), and had a great year. He definitely excelled in the double pivot with Kamara, but he’s a very well rounded and adaptable midfielder. Paired well with both McGinn and Tielemans as well. Supposedly Juve sold him for too much money to Genoa, it was one of the many deals Juve was punished for I'm not gonna judge either player until I see them in a Villa shirt. At this point I trust Emery enough to be happy with getting whoever he wants.  I'm just mainly sad about seeing Luiz go. Probably my favourite Villa player of the last few years. If that's true then I'm fully on board the McKennie hype train. Remember when everyone thought Morgan Rogers was a questionable signing yet Unai quickly made an effective Premier League player out of him? I read the comment and I thought 'what does Matty Cash have to do with City?' snatch ten threatening squeamish many important smell squealing provide truck   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Villa doesn't need cash. Owners willing to spend money and go in red while growing the team. They care about having profit for PSR reasons. McKennie and Illing will be valued as 30mn giving total value for Luiz as 80mn for accounting reasons.  That said, without PSR worries I'm sure they wouldn't be making this deal in the first place. Having cash and being allowed to spend isn’t the same thing They're starting to, they've been trimming their wage bill considerably every single year.  That's why they're moving Szczęsny. Lol, people always assume juve is broke while juve having the biggest income of any serie A teams and the wealthiest owners. I think we can cope with the loss of Luiz, certainly with Tielemans in the squad and the longer this saga goes on (plus the talk for a year or more that we’d have to sell to satisfy PSR) I’m at peace with it.  I think I’d rather see Dougie move out of the league than sign for another English club too. I wouldnt call mckine young with potential that's Jlings level already These guys don't understand man. They love underdog stories but like rules that will always keep them pinned. like citeh and their 115 fans? We bought Illing from Chelsea’s under 18 for 1.88m. Not sure if that affects the math here. Didn’t we already go to court for that and they said nothing is illegal but it seems unfair so they docked us points?   I think we’re fine tbh. No one here is getting valued beyond their market value Could be that the 20M will help sort them out and the swap will be better than their books in terms of getting players this window? Still you’d think they try to up the price as well. 20 mil goes immediately on the books. Money spent is amortized.  Based on the way Juve fans talk about their team these days, maybe that says a lot. Leeds fans hate McKennie though. There isn’t doing well and then there’s doing as badly as he did. Considering how so many can only recall his stint at Leeds and not last season, you're quite right. How do you have the old juve badge You’ve gotta remove the subjectivity of Luiz out of the equation.   The rules forced them into a sale, risking their competitiveness, even though they’ve just made a minimum of ~40m new money from Champions League but that 40m doesn’t count until next season.  It’s backwards. Well, Chelsea tbh Fair. But you do get 4 South American 17 year old wingers for it McKennie was great this season It depends on where you deploy McKennie. He was mostly a RM/RWB which seems to suit him well.  As a midfielder he’s…okay. Serviceable but poor in some crucial areas. As a RM/RWB he’s solid and can start Serie A is very different to the PL. McKennie was horrendous for Leeds [deleted] You capitalize when you get cash, now we don't.it Is the old plusvalenze game This - it isn’t just a phrase - it’s a way of life…  In Unai we trust! Hype train... We where there... Hope he does better as I truly love watching Villa in PL but that lad...   Be ready for huge knowhow fans coming from the states. Pep about to drop the yearly standard of £50m for another fullback? Not entirely right - Luiz has a value, the other two players have a value, that value will be included in the transaction. Otherwise you'd have situations where you buy an academy player for £50m alongside Luiz for £1m to avoid the clause. They will have to pay it regardless. >McKennie and Illing will be valued as 30mn giving total value for Luiz as 80mn for accounting reasons  I don't think that's how it will specifically work.   For accounting purposes, w/ your hypothetical values, Douglas Luiz would be 50 million with the profit for PSR being whatever that figure is above his existing amortisation. Then McKennie and Illing would be a total value of £30mil,chopped up over 4-5years or however long the contract is, so it's only going to be a roughly £6million or so dent in amortisation per year.  That's generally how these ""swaps"" work. They assume that because Juventus lost 120 millions last year, sure the agnelli have been covering those losses but ffp is a thing and it will limit severely the ability to spend The wealthiest is Como's owner now. Tbf, the 20m is just the amount of money actually being transferred. The fees will be much higher than that. 60 mil would go immediately into the books and the 40m would be amortised as cost. Trust me, if McKennie plays for Villa like he played for Juve this past season, Villa fans will be very happy with him. He was very excellent in a poor season for most Juve players. They’re still a top4 team in Serie A which as just overtaken LaLiga in the five year rankings.   I think McKennie could surprise a lot of people in England. Give him a competent coach and he will shine. And he has by every account bounced back from that.  Also, are you comfortable with basing your opinion on how Leeds fans feel? Yeah, but Leeds fans. ;)  Here's two points of reality with McKennie.  One, he was not fit at Leeds and it showed. That's on him but it's really only been that stretch in his career.  Two, he is a somewhat different player. He's a strong defender, especially in press, help and transition. He's great in the air, surprisingly effective in attack, very active. He has good passing vision and can hit a long switch.  But his passing accuracy isn't great and he's not super ball secure. So, you can't really rely on his as a primary ball progressor or a guy who sits back at CDM and pings the ball around. He will cost you there.  Playing him where he can cause chaos on defense and crash the box? He can protect your attackers and weaker midfielders defensively, create turnovers, get some assists and goals and be a ton of fun.  But don't put him into a traditional defensive midfield role, IMO. Juventus often played him on the right and it worked great. I also recall him having Mexican players put their hands on his throat on multiple occasion in front of the ref with no punishment whatsoever... but yeah, mostly I just remember how bad he was at Leeds. Same way as you set up the new logo, but I think mine is liste as old_Juventus or something like that Bro, it's about sustainability, about clubs being self-reliant, about not repeating Leeds in the aughts or all the other clubs that have quickly catapulted down the league tables and are in financial ruin or dissolved.    Villa went beyond their means to reach this point, they shouldn't be allowed to continue to build upon an unhealthy wage turnover, PSR prohibiting Villa and Chelsea is good.    Piss on Thatcher's grave with me bro, say yes to regulation. You gotta remove the subjectivity of Aston Villa doing an amazing job right now.   If they continue to improve in a sustainable way, they will eventually become a top 4 mainstay.     The owners want to accelerate the process, and the rules want to curb that.   The rules are flawed, yes, but clubs should be protected from their owners all the same.    Some of us remember how Portsmouth were in FA cup finals and being denied European football because their ownership was a complete shitshow. Portsmouth's relegation still stung me as hard as Newcastle and Leeds did.   Ambition isn't always met with competence,  and it's Villan fans who'd have to pick up the pieces if shit goes south. McKenzie was bad for Juve too around that time but he was just coming back from like 6 months out with broken foot. He was starting to look great before the injury and has gotten back to that level this year Leeds were horrendous. He came unfit in January.  Also a lot of the time it’s not even a league thing but a club. Some players just don’t perform at certain clubs but can at others. Look at Phillips for Leeds and absolutely dog shit for City and West Ham English tax is a meme, it's really more PL tax, and English players just mostly play for PL teams or are targeted by PL teams, and PL teams have lots of money so both can usually afford to wait for higher fees instead of having to accept lower offers and/or pay higher fees.    Illing Jr seems versatile and is probably a good talent, but he hasn't played regular first team football yet (like over 1000 minutes in a season) and he isn't exactly regarded as one of England's top talents. He also has a year left so it's not like you have leverage. 20 million Euros is a fair valuation I'd say. We’re going to get cash. It will be like the Pianic deal. They pay 20-25 for McKennie and Iling, we pay 60 for Luis They’re not prepared for the “USMNT players can do no wrong” crowd to come flooding into their online spaces, I feel sorry for them tbh. > They will have to pay it regardless.  My mind went straight to City getting McKinnie's right leg and torso as their sell on clause.  This probably isn't right. That makes total sense yea, my bad, I was just trying to convey the idea that the 2 player swap is definitely helping Villa in getting better value for Luiz, not strictly in getting actual cash, but for accounting reasons. It’s not really a fair judgement for his time at leeds in a pretty dysfunctional team.   Mckennie is one of those players with a pretty high floor because he’s physically immense. He’s quick, strong and can run for days. A prem team always has room for a player like that. Heheh Also worth keeping in mind that a big part of his fitness was because he had been out for a while with a broken leg. Yes he should have worked harder to get fully fit faster, but it wasn’t like he just got out of fitness for no reason. He's a B2B, like clearly    >Also a lot of the time it’s not even a league thing but a club  Can also be about the manager tactics. Bailey is doing better under Emery, no? I do agree, he has the potential to be a fine player, but he's not as good as Luiz Are you sure of what you are saying? I am already getting downvoted Well yeah exactly. There’s so many factors that go into a player being a success or a flop, I hate when people go oh he failed in the prem already that means he can never play well for a different club depends what Luiz we talking about, he blows hot and cold. Second half of the season Luiz shouldn’t have been starting above Youri The numbers surely aren’t confirmed but that IS how swap transfers work always. Juve just have to be careful with the valuations after getting in trouble for it. Don’t get me wrong, the US is my other national team, but I was left gobsmacked by how many were arguing with your fanbase about how Brenden Aaronson and McKennie were actually performing well and everyone else was to blame during the season Leeds went down. It must have felt like cosmic retribution over something you’re not entirely sure you actually did. There’s definitely a crowd that does that, but it balances with the crowd that *only* blames the US players It was quite a lot for us also, as we had 3 US players + manager. The eyes where hard on us and everyone else to be blamed. But it is pretty evident that there is something with their performance or mentality.   Aaronson did not have best season on load.   Adams - injured constnatly, had like few games only in PL  Marcsh - Was long time unemployed, now Canada head coach. He might be suited more for national team. will see how he does.  McKennie - only one who improved and wanted to be back on top. Maybe there where personal reasons etc that effected him. Just hope as now it will be permanent transfer he will have motivation and desire to keep pushing. The latter is a reaction to the former."
"Douglas Luiz - “Why did I leave Premier League? Any player in the world would have wanted to have an experience at Juventus. I am no different. It doesn’t depend so much on the league, but on the size of the club.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* I'm glad we didn't sell him to another PL club. Hope he does amazing at Juve. Fair enough, saying you played for Juve is pretty damn amazing. it's amazing how the wholesomeness of the statement is influencing the comments in this thread. A team that had famous players like Zidane, Deschamps, Conte, Del Piero, Vialli, Nedved, etc. Yeah, thats pretty cool Douglas. Totally understandable, Juve is a legendary club and unless you're already playing in one, it's probably pretty hard to turn an offer like that down. Fair. Diaby’s legacy will be all the money he’s going to leave for his grandchildren to blow through Did he really need to justify leaving Villa for Juve? Why does this even need a justification he left fucking Aston Villa for JUVENTUS lol [deleted] Well the fact they doubled his salary to 150k per week and added a nice fat signing bonus sure must've helped a bit. Im very curious for this new juve. Lets hope they cant get a good team again. Also I hope italy starts to develop more young players. World cups without a strong italy just arent the same :( This is preposterous   Why doesn't he understand that outside of England football doesnt exist Rather tell my family I'm banging Alisha Lehman  Kidding, he's not wrong. When you remember these players are human it makes sense. If you think about it from your own perspective, even if objectively Villa are just as good as Juve nowadays it's still not the same name.  And living in Turin gotta be nicer than Birmingham. We love you dougie, you’re always welcome back at Villa. Hope you smash it at Juve, unless we play each other in the champions league 👀 ‘My bird signed for them’ That haircut really suits him. Nice to see a player being pretty upfront about his reasons. Gotta respect that and certainly cannot argue with his reasoning. Douglas Luiz : It's not about the motion of the ocean,  It's about the size of the club Didn’t his ex recently sign for Juve too? Gonna miss watching him for Villa.   They’ve been a treat to watch for the last 2-3 seasons.   All while Juventus have been impossible to watch and I stick to Roma, Inter and a couple of other teams when I watch serie A. He is just making shit up!! Lol! Juve bigger than Villa confirmed. In other words - Villa is a tinpot club Rather Milan than Juve but each to their own He didn’t say the word “project”? His PR guy must be foomin Wasn’t it his girl that forced him to move too ? In all his playtime in the friendlies so far he’s been outstanding. Everyone is really excited about him It's true. I told my my mum I played for Juve. And my wife. Neither of them follow football, so who's to know? Just ask Lord Bendtner I can see him having a really long career too, he shouldn’t have to justify it like players who go Saudi do So true, was expecting more comments to be shitting on how badly the club has been run in recent years but no, just cheers and good luck. Not to mention Baggio, Buffon, Trezeguet, Davids, Birindelli, Chiellini, Thuram, Cristiano Ronaldo, Cannavaro, Marchisio and Zambrotta Forgot pogba but yeah it's a historic club for sure I mean I think Juventus has the most different Ballon D'or winners of all time after Real. And you could argue Real stole one that was Juve's in Cannavaro's in 2006. How did you miss Cristiano in there my man Not to mention Legrottaglie, Arthur, De Ceglie. Didn’t have Alan Hutton though did they Lots of players aren‘t chasing any legacies & don‘t enjoy playing football that much anymore. Lot of them see it as their job and that‘s it. Most would just never admit that.  So they try to make as much money as possible before retiring in their mid 30s English media I think they don't enjoy playing for brasil because of the weight of the expectation, they are constantly compared to the greats of the past and when they don't deliver they get crucified, it's win or nothing for Brazil, that pressure doesn't exist for them in the same way at club level. These talks always makes me cringe. Whenever going get hard, fans always blame players for lacking passion or not playing for shirt. Football has like a thousand variables that make difference. > Endrick even talked about how the players could've been on vacation instead of playing Copa America. Basically that they should've been resting for the club season.   i had a much different takeaway from that comment.  his point was that the players DID care about brazil nt. if they didn't they'd be on vacation. this is not new, the only true new variable is is the crazy evolution of all the technicalities around football which reduced the gap by a lot between teams with brilliant individual talents and teams with a good execution plan. I mean usually big teams also pay more but sure Acting like a EPL team wouldn’t easily do that He would have gotten 150k (probably even a bit more) at aston villa with a new contract aswell. He was clearly their best midfielder and tielemanns is on 150k a week aswell for example.  And signing bonus are only massive if players leave as free agent. This move was definitly not about money His girlfriend signed for the women’s team too I think. We would have done the same without psr issues, shame really And they also signed his bird they even signed his girlfriend lol He could have probably got similar money at Villa tbf. Aren't foreigners taxed differently in Italy?  150k/week in the England isn't the same as Italy. Iirc the take home would be 40-50% more. Living in Birmingham has to be much nicer then living in Liverpool too 👋🏼 its not his ex, its his girlfriend ‘Juventus were impossible to watch, so I watched Jose Mourinho’s Roma instead’. Make sure to watch Juventus this season you do realize that a way a team plays is dictated by the manager right ?   And we signed one of the most promising new mangers in Europe, so its your loss if you don't watch. Historically both clubs share the same prestige, although Milan had more success in Europe than Juve but objectively that was literally decided by the small details of the finals (we lost 7 fucken finals lol)  In term of legendary players and overall prestige, I think both clubs are equal (despite the local dominance from Juve) He’s a truly quality player. There’s zero bad blood for him from Villa fans. Worked hard for us and stuck around when he didn’t have to through some turbulence. Bummed PSR basically forced us to sell and wish the best for him. Good luck this year If you put him in the right set up you have one of the best midfielders in Italy no doubt about it in my opinion, at his best he ran the show for us and I'm sad to see him go. Not gonna be so exciting against Atletico, we’re gonna win that friendly Not them, that’s for sure Photoshop yourself next to Del Piero and Zidane and you'll have proof. Juve tells it's grandchildren that it played for Bendtner Ibrahimović and Pirlo Platini baby Bendtner Danilo Anelka🙌 And Pinsoglio In fairness Pogba was world class for us. We haven’t seen anyone fill his shoes since in his role Also forgot Rincon Cristiano is a legend, but not a Juventus legend.   He is however one of the greatest names to throw if you want people to think your club is prestigious, but this would put is in the same basket of PSG and Al-NASSR FC And goat simone zaza Legend of Matri too How could you forget Poulsen and Felipe melo? Hogging generational wealth for your great great grandkids is disgusting when there are so many people starving and suffering today though. It does at the bigger clubs. Doesn't matter how bad the Juve squad is their fans will always demand they win the league I mean even highlighting it as a possibility shows you kinda dont care. Please inform Gerry Cardinale about this Acting like we couldn't easily have done that lmao. He wanted to leave and we had a new offer for him on the table since January and I highly doubt it would have been far from 150k. They wouldn’t have sold for that much to another pl side That law is no more in place. They have to pay the same amount now. Absolutely not Oh, my bad, thought they were broken up. Haha, we’ll see mate, check back come Sunday Plot-twist, he wasn't even born when Del Piero and Zidane played for Juve. hes no padoinho Went to watch Juventus against Milan at the San Siro and watching him live was absolutely unbelievable. Made the game look effortlessly easy, decided to ignore the ball for 5 minutes and just follow what he did and I was blown away. Such a shame how he never quite got it going in the same way after his Manchester United move. He was one of the best midfielders in the world his last year with Juve, crazy how much he fell off when he joined United. Pogba had very good seasons for United as well. This myth he was terrible for us is so weird 🤌🏻 Go after billionaires not footballers It‘s not like you are going to save them if you don‘t sign that multi million contract.  The money will either stay at the rich owner of the club or they will just sign someone else.  Refusing big salaries is not the way to fix this. Ikr it's disgusting when poor people work hard and get paid for it May I ask what you are doing for those starving and suffering people? I'm sure you have what's considered generational wealth to a lot of the poorest people on earth. From your post I'm assuming you are already doing your part and redistributing that to them though. Blame the game not the player. It really isnt the same. If juve does good in the champions league supporters will be happy. Brazilians have no connection to european teams, if it doesnt workout just move to other team. Brazil is win the world cup or you are trash. No in between. Your country is watching. Its absurd pressure. And they get compared to a huge list of legendary players (who really arent supportive). Its very toxic. People forget but even messi quit argentina national team because of the pressure and comparisons. Sure, but not in the same way. If a Brazilian player signs for Juventus he doesn't have a connection to the city, the fans, and so on, in the same way he does to his nation. It still sucks to let club fans down but letting down **your** nation is wildly different. Particularly for big football nations like Brazil and even more so when that nation hasn't won a major title for a while. If you underperform for a big club you're still making bank, and then you move for a slightly smaller club while still making a lot more money and living a more confortable life than in Brazil. It's not the same pressure.  They feel grateful for the opportunity to play for a big club. They feel Brazilians should be grateful that they didn't refuse to play for the National Team. ""Us footballers shouldn't be playing this many games in a season""  Is this a footballer saying they don't care about the games they play in?  Seems a bit of faulty logic there. That’s the point I’m making brother.  This wasn’t a move motivated by money Would have been maybe even more. Aren‘t kamara & tielemanns both on 150k a week? Oh TIL, is that a recent change? i dont think there is much difference, both full of their fair share of bagheads Good luck. Aupa Atleti Or Milos Krasic When you watch the game you don't see Pogba. When you watch Pogba you see the whole game. His 18/19 stats were ridiculous for us. He didn't fall off as much as people seem to think. He was very good for us at points albeit inconsistent   You don't get into the PFA team of the season if you're not very good > Go after billionaires not footballers  This is also a fallacy, billionaires are just part of the system.  We should go after this illusion we call democracy if we want to change anything. Why do their great grandkids need to be born into wealth? Isn't it enough to support themselves and immediate family?  We don't even know if the world will be liveable in that time with climate change etc Giving money to charity every month? Supporting political parties which raise these questions?  What more can I do, I'm not rich Never has a player experienced more pressure than messi for Argentina, its quite dumb really to put so much on one man in a team sport. Yes happened near the end of last season I believe. Any new signings are no more exempt. I just said Birmingham isn't absolutely much better than Liverpool. Didn't say Liverpool was better 😂 Ouasim mother fuckin Bouy Krasic was actually phenomenal before Conte's arrival, and I was actually so ticked off and perplexed he cut him out of the team. He was in the PFA team of the season that year but IMO he was better for us in 16/17  The narrative that he was awful for us is so weird. Recently saw a list ranking him as the second worst signing of the post Fergie area behind the likes of Sancho and Antony. It's absurd lmao Football players aren't nearly as wealthy as you think they are Bit of a cop out.  Do you take a lower salary to help others? Or what are you insisting the 'rich' do?  You blame them for earning money, why do you even have a penny in the bank? Hold yourself to the supposed standards you have and see how realistic it is. History will forget that because he got his win. When in history the best player of your team QUIT because your own countrymen are so toxic? People bad mouth cr7 in portugal much less after that euro win. I still remember when he came to portugal and people yelled messi to provoke him IN PORTUGAL!!! his own people!! (i live in lisbon for a while now). National teams are something else completely. Multiply that to Brazil who has had much more success than argentina and portugal. Its the most pressure ever to play for Brazil. Vini hate in brazil is already starting, soon it will be endrick and so it goes on. Untill you win and youre not thrash anymore. It cant be enjoyable. Put some respect on Eljero Elia’s name Yeah, he was hailed as the second coming of Nedved (same haircut lol) with his early season form including a hatrick. Then he got suspended for diving which coincided with opposition teams figuring out how to counter him it started going down hill. He did have some dreadful games at the end to be fair The ones who chase bag in Middle East are"

Deserved goal, it had been comming aaaaaaaaand thats back to negative GD for United  fun fact: United haven't finished with a positive GD since Matchday 1  They won 1-0 on Matchday 1, and had a negative GD or 0, since then [deleted] finally Finally Hit'em with the shimmy shimmy lol Why was he shimmying at Varane? Did I miss something? 😂 Celly game strong our twitch prince scores!!!!! LMAO that celebration Take that celeb to FIFA pls! Get it in EA FC now. Deserved! Man Utd are pretty shite aren’t they Yeah I need that celebration gif now Douglas Luiz has a great last two games attacking wise an assist against Sheffield United Best celebration I’ve seen in years that hahaha The only thing better than an equaliser against Manchester United is a winner against them. Do it Villa! Been coming. Shaw injured. Lindelof been getting cooked. It's over. Goodbye United. Time for gym. Deserved. They've battered Utd throughout the game Its been coming Well that was absolutely coming. What are we even doing? At first I thought he was wearing one glove like a golfer but it’s a bandage Personal its been coming Ayo he kinda ate that shimmy though. The shimmy lmao Volta pro Vasco Wanted him to pull the shirt up and it says "" 67th minute"" Shake that Douglas Luiz shaking his tits Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay,  Gimme the ball so I can put it away. The dance to Onana was wow 😂 Shameless shimmy😭😭 u/savevideo Class finish This game is fucking unreal. Constant counter attacks and Man U kept pulling save out of their asses Insert Karl malone gif Shimmy shimmy cocoa puff His belly dancing instructor will be proud [Replay/AA](https://imgur.com/a/g3ioW6U) Onana had to have been chatting shit My man hit the Eddie Guerrero taunt lmao (Great Jiggle) Was that in response to something Onana did? Seemed oddly targeted lol Aged like warm milk, you fucking love to see it. Lil shimmy Aged perfectly Little shimmy Channeling his inner Brazilian belly dancer Douglas Luiz frequents r/nbacirclejerk Shimmy shimmy shimmy Man has been watch Steph Curry too much 😂 Mardi Gras tit shake in Onana’s face Just homage to one of the GOATs of basketball Good thing they're not playing the Leafs, might be a cross check to the face. Needs more wet-look kit \[Great Polaroid Picture\] ADD IT TO FIFA RN Yeah that poor sportsmanship/taunting tho [deleted] Doesn’t matter, it’s out there. Expect it to be used again Varane has been asleep all game it feels like He ain't celebrating now Yup, one of his stronger matches IMO. He shimmied at his dick But it was hilarious because varane was confused as fuck. Just threw his hands up going “wtf!” 😂 Is taunting not a thing in the premier league? Onana I saw that. If the VAR asked the ref to view that, there was enough for him to overturn the goal. Or Luiz kicking Varane after the ball gets cleared the first time… Yes, bad foul, maybe Onana should've go to the ground You mean like how VAR gifted United the first goal? Rashford dive, Casemiro offside, Maguire shoving Kamara just before the goal? Because onana has been a fool Understandable given that Everton rarely celebrates 👍🏻 lol pelo menos agora temos Sforza 😎 Damn that dude is a cunt  Never change What Douglas Luiz says in bed I think its bcs onana saved almost every aston villa shot in that stance. But im just guessing tbh I think it was just towards the Villa fans behind the goal Probably just a clown lol Alan Pardew just left the groupchat [deleted] Great movement Not enough mimicking taking a shit Found Carragher’s reddit account. He's just like casually stepping around Onana and doesn't really even react when the ball goes in. not really on varane tbh as soon as lindelof came on for shaw we have been so shakey on the left that everyone has to go over and help out. like all of villas attacks have been down their right side cuz lindelof is lost in the sauce (out of position but still lost in the sauce). also rashford isnt really tracking back either so thats great as well He’s been asleep since he left Madrid All season Nah man! That shit was lit He's been alright outside the UCL tbh, although that is the most important tournament... He’s been immense Yeah happens every now and again I just love a simple shimmy It's not untrue. They did get battered. Villa just didn't finish their chances [deleted] Shoots too early u/mrsunsfan lore in r/soccer 🤯 Scott Mctominay is Douglas Luiz father Shaq.gif That goal is a lot on Varane, corner is cleared and then just stays on the goal line instead of going to mark the free player who ends up scoring.   But United have been pretty dreadful all game. Such a strange team. Him playing with Martinez vs without is like a completely different Cb. Varane and Maguire partnership has pretty much always been a disaster. I think buying older players from Real Madrid is asking for trouble. Chances are they've won it all and aren't the same player you saw. Trying to block that from my memory lol I can't really make sense of transfer fees anymore, so I don't know if £45m is about right for what he's shown so far, but to me it feels like at that price for a goalkeeper we'd expect a little bit more than ""alright"". He hasn't been helped by the constant chopping and changing of players in front of him either to be fair to him. Nah. League > CL So glad Man U wins after that disrespect naa the stamp on onana's foot you see in the AA replays With Alisha, I can't blame him U bum Shimmy shimmy. Shimmy I don't really agree, Villa are quite good, it's not like United are playing Sheffield. They barely play together, and I think when they have it's been a decent win rate  Issue is the back line changes from game to game Lol, Varane is a grown ass man. He didn't react like shit because of Maguire Ronaldo and Ramos were still very good when they left us but yeah it seems like Varane can't be arsed to put in the effort anymore. You'd know better than me, I haven't watched every game he has played,  but what keeper could you have gone for that is less than 45m (or equal to) who would have performed better? Premier league will never be bigger than ucl and you know it Luka Doncic is Devin Booker father Villa had so many chances to score and probably dominated. I don’t like how little control Man United have in games with how they set up in midfield Tf you talking about reacting for. I’m saying he PLAYS completely different without Martinez. Both Varane and Casemiro were excellent last season. Those two are freaks who treat their bodies like machines.   I don't want to make out like Varane/Casemiro don't as I genuinely don't know. All I can point to is that Casemiro has slowed down, and asking him to play in a league where transition play happens much quicker feels harsh. I mean you could have kept De Gea. You're right, that's what I'm struggling with. He probably was the best we could get. I think once he has a fully settled side in front of him with everyone back we'll be able to assess him a bit better. Who cares. League over a cup always. Both of them played very well last season.  This season ETH hasn't figured out the midfield defensively yet, they push very high up so whenever they lose the ball, the defenders are isolated. There's a reason DDG is still unemployed De Gea knocked us out of the Europa and lost us the FA cup final. First season Casemiro was great, but as most rightly presumed, he was old and that level wasn’t maintainable. The second the structure went around him he also struggled. He's been good this season when he's not asked to do all the running for himself and Eriksen or Mount."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Can’t lie, that’s soft as hell Woof, that is soft. Wouldn’t be happy if that was the other way round. VAR is never overturning that because there's contact, but that's such a dive. It's minimal touch to the bottom of his foot, I'm actually impressed he felt it at all. And the amount of luck it took for that to go in, damn... I hate that any contact = penalty, the threshold is so low. This is extremely weak. Him rolling around smashing the ground with his hand like he got a season ending injury is embarrassing too Unlucky for Burnley. Embarrassing dive That’s a certified dive. Yes there’s a little touch but not enough to go down and definitely not like that Never a pen. Soft as hell Was that stalling really necessary? Soft as fuck. What a joke. Where is VAR Contact but not enough to go down like that. Not a pen for me Man what a peno Damn Burnley got robbed 10 minutes for the worst penalty call That’s awful. Barely touched him. How is that a penalty? Theatrical flop sold it big time Incredibly soft Lol no way is that a penalty These players have no shame Egregiously bad decision. He’s looking for the slightest contact. Should be yellow for diving…. Soft  And what a theatre like he got shot So if you now sneeze on a player its a pen VAR just has to remove that one. Can they for once have a week when they dont fuck up easy calls? absolute comedy That is a complete joke. Did Burnley dirty on this one. Certainly not a pen. thought my screen froze he stood there for so long Not every contact should be a pen. There’s no reason to fall down like this with this kind of contact on the bottom of his foot Even as a Villa fan that’s soft as hell. Definite contact but Duran sold it That’s such a pathetic call Refs trying their best to keep the title race interesting They need to get rid of that ""clear and obvious"" part in the laws. I blame that for these soft pens being given after a VAR check. So Saka's one was considered a dive but this one is a penalty 🤣 how can the ref give that. play on or yellow for diving Thats not a pen. How VAR didnt intervene i dont know Hope Duran can recover after that /s He should be banned for a run up like that. Joke call What has happened to the game I loved So the Carlos's handball wasn't a pen, but this is a pen?! What a joke! Burnley deserves at least a point. That's not a soft pen, it's simply not a penalty That’s not a pen That's softs as baby shit.. That’s a joke of a call. Burnley absolutely robbed of a draw. Villa getting lucky with that pen. why the burnley player thought he could control the ball was really stupid Shameful that these dives are rewarded. He stays on his feet and that's not ever called. That’s soft, it will get given since it was originally but man that is a painful way to lose Soft as fuck but if Nunez one is a foul the other week thats the standard they are going by probably be like 2-3 pens a match now. PGMOL being doggo again. Should’ve been a yellow for Durán Shameful call. If that's a pen, they need to revise the rule. Barely taps the bottom of his foot and he goes down like he stepped on a landmine lmao Robertson on Welbeck a few years back. Hated that call and hate this Not even a penalty. [deleted] Soft red soft pen Fuck off Trash decision, standard needs to be higher Falon D’Floor Can these English ref get any worse? In what universe is that a pen, soft as fuck McGinn trying to dribble while appealing lol Saka was denied a penalty for less than this last night. Just one of them seasons for Villa. Every possible 50/50 has gone their way. I hope city with the fucking league, piss off everyone. Thank god VAR makes sure every goal is onside but handling ball outside box? Nah fuck that no red, soft as pen? Nah no review, you would think he got shot the way he dropped One of those If ref hadn't given penalty, VAR won't say it's a clear and obvious error so wouldn't be a pen. Now ref gave it and then VAR probably resonates that ""yeah, it's probably soft, but I can't say it's a clear and obvious error. Probably a foul but also a dive. Burnley robbed Ayew got the same contact earlier, and no pen. Man the ref and VAR are such soft core. Game gone. Thats never a pen wtf, complete diving cunt Is it just my though or the ref is looking for Duran reaction to decide it's a penalty or not? Joke decision and pathetic dive from Duran. Meaningless contact should not be a penalty. PATHETIC !!! That was never a penalty. Such a horrendous dive ! Should have been pulled back for diving. Such little contact could never genuinely result in a reaction like that. How is that a penalty but odegaard can play basketball and it isn't a pen That’s cheating full stop. Game’s gone, absolutely gone Cheating Villa are this seasons darling I see. Not a pen, simulation and diving from Villa and it’s so bad, I can’t believe they were given that. The contact is so minimal, no way he is in that much pain from a little tap like that. We would literally never get that pen.  Pretty sure that happened 2-3 times to Saka and Jesus on Thursday and we rightfully were not given a pen. Vasco Soft as baby shit Villa bailed out by a soft pen. That was an awful pen too. You guys are such clowns for thinking this is not a penalty.   And the player is right to throw himself to the ground after being KICKED in the foot, otherwise refs don't give that. Gotta keep the villa fairy tail going lol. We've seen 20 of these alone this season and none given. What a dive As a Villa fan, that's soft as fuck, another embarrassing game, Burnley are now bound to get another goal (or two) to complete the full Villa experience and we're 100% deserved it. If the ref doesn’t call it, VAR never gives it. Well that’s it, any contact in the box is a penalty now. Thought the replay froze but it was just Luiz being a fanny And look at that flop, he easily could have just continued running but fell.... how are people saying this isnt a pen?? his foot gets kicked? every attacker is falling down there, its always a pen. maybe people here are blind? The game has lost its soul. Was there any contact at all? They're not overturning that but that's Charmin... You can't argue with logic anymore. Did a sniper hit him? Embarrassing VAR is underutilised. They won't get involved with this because there's the tiniest amount of contact, even though it's objectively not a foul and should be a booking for simulation. It's probably a foul because there is a kick on the foot.  But I fucking detest how every footballer reacts like that. *A tap on the bottom of a plastic boot* *""ARGHHHHH!""*  I love the sport but I hate that I have to support twats like this. This is a tough one. Its either soft as shit or never a pen for me. But for once, I don't think VAR can really be blamed here because of the whole ""clear and obvious"" thing. Ref probably tells them he saw the foot kick and called it based on that (though why did he stare at it so long?) and VAR can't say that the kick didn't happen. Maybe a penalty but a dive like that should get yellow lol, cunt Corrupt VAR Never a penalty!  Sick and tired of the only thing to talk about after a prem match is the bad refereeing. One of those times when it'd have been better for the ref to just have deferred it to VAR. VARs never turning this should be the right decision. Was the ball going out and then hit the keeper on the back? This is exact the same as the Isak pen, at least they’re consistent then M’barassing Add this to the list of ""If the on-field referee doesn't give it, VAR doesn't spend a second on it"". So unbelievably soft. No way lmao It will be tough for villa, having Duran out for the rest of the season. Honestly I think Ramsey's look to the ref like ""oh shit nopeIdidn'ttouchhim"" made him give it. Actually embarrassing. This is a situation where VAR should be saying ""Yes there is contact, but it's not enough for a foul, yellow card for simulation."" Mirror: https://streamin.one/v/3cd51a8d I feel.. what’s the opposite of shame? I agree. This is the first time I’ve seen it (listened to the match on the radio) and I’d be fuming if that went against us. Duran really milked it. Agreed.   We were due one after the Sheff U debacle tbh His right knee buckles after slight contact with the bottom of the LEFT foot. Absolutely pathetic Actually laughable how hard he was rolling around. You’d think he’d been shot. Kicked on the bottom of the foot, grabs his ankle.  We do not help ourselves as a sport sometimes lol. If they're telling linesmen to only give clear offsides then surely referees should only be giving clear penalties. I agree it’s never a pen but to say one that goes in off the woodwork is luck is mental, if it goes in off the woodwork it’s a perfect penalty Villa vs Arsenal 2 weeks ago. Defender goes to clear the ball as Jesus gets there ahead of him. Kicks Jesus in the back of the leg. No penalty. Nothing given by VAR. And that was far more meaningful contact than this. I love football, but the sport has become a real farce in some ways. He’s also never scoring in a million years if he doesn’t get fouled. Not even facing goal, barely even had possession. To give what is essentially a free goal for that is just diabolical lmao They've overturned those contacts before though and should've done it here aswell. Unfortunately we are at that point where most contact, even minimal, is a penalty.   Fans constantly ask for it as well. There was minimal if any impact on him here. Poor decision I am thinking back to the Havertz penalty vs man utd which was overturned.  The ref gave the pen originally and VAR decided to overturn it even though there was contact, I would say the situation is very similar but the outcome is very different here.  Referees will continue to be inconsistent but managers will be punished for calling it out. I mean it's not because just look at Villa contacting the bottom of Jesus's foot 2 weeks ago. Just as much if not more contact than this. The refs just suck and couldn't be more inconsistent. unless it's by a GK, where it reverses  the game is pretty fucked up these days Contact into dive is always a penalty I guess, there's a reason every player and their mother dives like the grass is an olympic diving pool Maybe one of the worst things with VAR is this. Imagine using the same ""any contact""-ruling outside the penalty box and games will have 50 more free kicks on average. Used to be it required more to get a pen vs a free kick and now it's completely opposite. Mo Salah would like a word … It's more like var can't overturn it if there is contact, if the ref doesn't call it a pen I don't think var will have any questions about it Unless it’s Luiz kicking through the calf of Jesus in the box. Then it’s “not enough contact”. It's more like var can't overturn it if there is contact, if the ref doesn't call it a pen I don't think var will have any questions about it Just when their form is good they face Villa and Liverpool, hope they can keep playing like this in 2024 always a pen that is a pen I first thought that the video stopped playing. I asked in the stadium has the ref blown, he took ages It's soft as fuck but it's never getting overturned since there was contact. Dude acted like he got shot. Aston Villa is the new fairytale  No wonder they are getting help Missed a Villa red card too, one of those days Only if they dive and act like they got shot Pen and a red Seriously. Such an easy call. It's not getting overturned by VAR cus there is contact.   It's soft but under current rules VAR won't change that call It’s a contact sport Both should be play on but theres never any consistency Is there contact? Yes. Is it a foul? Is he impeded? No. Will VAR do anything? No because there was contact  Contact is the only thing that VAR was looking for. Trust me Cos there’s contact and that’s enough to not make it an obvious error it seems After the Sheffield United match I call it retribution lol, the refs are absolutely horrible in this league that's for sure. The Carlos handball earlier this game? It wasnt in the penalty box though? He stood there for about 10 seconds. He waited a while to take it Multitasking at its finest Rightfully so. That was a complete dive.   As was this It was a dive mate it is inconsistent but Saka did not deserve a pen The one against Sheffield didnt D: Probably wouldn't even get a second look if the ref didn't call it.   Really should've sent him for a review. That was ridiculously soft. Nobody should. Oh bore off man wah wah Jesus against Liverpool last year? poor you :( ""Why always me""  Instead of going ""nobody would get this pen called"" you play the victim unnecessarily and say ""WE would never get this pen"". We either It's not always about you. r/ImTheMainCharacter I mean it went in and the keeper had no chance lol. you're more dramatic than Duran i can see why a united fan would be confused, it's the kind of pens they used to always get. No one is denying there’s contact. But it’s not anywhere near enough to warrant him going down.   Most people are sick of the idea of any contact in the box being a penalty Contact only shouldn't be enough for a pen. Way too little in this. just a tap on the foot doesn’t send you flying like that.. it’s interesting to see who has played football and who hasn’t, and this thread is the perfect control study Proud? As a villa fan, that is a very soft peno. Alike to what real Madrid gets as soon as i saw the rolling theatrics, i knew it was going to be a soft pen You’d think his foot was shattered to pieces with how he reacted. So pathetic My old favorite in college when some dived was telling the ref I think a sniper got him. Because this is a bad call.  There's no chance this is given if the ref sees it again, nor would var consider recommending this for review if the ref missed it. There was more contact on Saka Thursday and that rightfully wasn’t given. I’m so sick of the inconsistency. always was lol, you think players didnt fake contact [deleted] Except when it's not. I'm sure every fan base can think of instances of their guys getting taken out fairly hard in the box and it's not called. I can think of 4 in like the last month for my team. I'm sure we've gotten away with a few too. It's the inconsistency that drives everyone crazy. I could live with this if it was always called. Unless Jarred Gillet is the ref apparently. Son got barged down off the ball at the edge of the box and he just waved it off. > Fans constantly ask for it as well  Unbiased match-going fans crying for a goal. Unthinkable that. Definitely their fault. Well that's a lie. Most of them are not penalties but the inconsistency in giving them is mental. There were 2 bigger contacts in Arsenals loss against WHU and neither was given by the match official (rightly so) and VAR didn't intervene.   If this isn't given by the match official then VAR won't intervene either because it's simply a pathetic dive. But because the match official gave it the VAR will say the decision stands because it is not a ""clear and obvious error"" since there's some contact.    PGMOL made up that statement in the first place because they need a viable escape plan for every shit decision they make. Can't make your mate look bad on TV for millions to see now can we.     In an honest world VARs would not care about the image or the pressure on the refs and would just be enforcers so that the correct decision would stand in the end. Not in EPL though. Mates need to look out for mates as already said. Its not always tho, theres constant inconsistencies. Saka dived against West Ham but there was clear contact, penalty wasnt given, nor should it have but then this gets given two days later They can or VAR is useless. If VAR can't question a referee on a decision this clear then what is VAR good for aside from making the game softer? They have done it before but are inconsistent with that too.  What a surprise Neither were pens, simple  (We’ve had many not given this season so we’ll take this) Played well in the 2nd half against Liverpool and deserved a point today. Always difficult when the ref is giving penalties for shit like this though. Villa literally handed the victory today found Bruno sometimes a pen No it isnt Maybe if a Burnley sniper shot him for across the pitch yeah No /s…. Right? And that's the problem, by the rules, it is a pen, but for the sake of the game it shouldn't be. Contact = pen just encourages diving. Football is a contact sport and contact should never equal foul on its own. Definitely not true when we had 3 stonewall penalties denied vs Sheffield. Name checks out Yeah we ain't finishing top 4 if we play like we have this and the last 2 games. We should have been clear by this point but our finishing and final balls have been bollocks. Dare I say pressure getting to the players because we are playing less fluid than we were pre Arsenal The handball? That's never a red. It should be a fk and yellow but it literally didn't stop anything since he got a shot off and was clearly not intentional.   We are fortunate to be winning this game but if you're talking about the handball that would be a ridiculous red but they wouldn't give it if the ref didn't, VAR is in such a shit spot imo, need to get the correct call right instead of only addressing 'ref errors' Apologies, I thought it was inside the box. They never showed a replay on the TV channel I watch. That is bold and original. Never heard that one. Next you'll be telling us to pull your finger Appreciate everyone has had some bad decisions this season but don't embellish. Saka completely dived. I’m not saying it’s against the rules I’m saying the rules are shit. I’m happy that more and more people are starting to talk like this. It’s absurd to give a penalty for every foul in the box. The rule should be changed so that fouls like this one only result in an indirect free kick or something. More contact on the Maddison one at Brentford than this one here Lol >But because the match official gave it the VAR will say the decision stands because it is not a ""clear and obvious error"" since there's some contact.     They aren't even this consistent. I remember when havertz went down very easily against man utd and the referee gave a penalty, then VAR overturned it. It's basically a coin toss as to whether they will deem an error to be 'clear and obvious' enough, I can't see any actual metric being applied. look at his foot + the contact only happens because Duran stick his foot in the way of Ramsey who is already in a kicking motion. Contact = pen is a product of VAR and especially slow motion.  When they use slow motion everything looks like more contact than in live play.  They should at least ban slow-mo from VAR and only use live play speed. Agree for the most part. This shouldn't be a penalty but what's the line? I dont like refs making subjective, is that *enough* contact, calls. It should be clearly defined and I don't have the right answer/definition It will be just like ""only in the league because hawkeye failed"" and pretend we never ever get any decisions against us. No point talking to delusional people like that. One stonewall penalty, one maybe penalty and one never a penalty. The hand ball was atrocious and I can go either way on the Watkins push, but the Ramsey one was absolutely nothing. Pens are off the table when you play the blades Don't panic yet. We're a different side with Kamara and Pau starting. You are knackered and injuried like the rest of the league. These 105min ++ games are taking a toll on the players I agree, it's crazy that a foul wasn't given there and we absolutely got away with that, but that's never a red card. No idea how that's not intentional, he's swung his arm at it. I completely agree. VAR isn’t getting us more consistency in terms of what is and what isn’t a penalty. It’s just giving us more grey areas in my opinion. Yes it was a dive and it wasn’t a penalty. Still more contact than this.  If Saka’s wasn’t a penalty (and it wasn’t) this *definitely* shouldn’t have been. [deleted] Totally agree with you. Hate cheap fouls being bought by theatrical reactions on minimal contact, especially as it just incentivizes players to go down as they know they'll get a better opportunity to score from a penalty. It's been going on for so long now people just accept it's the done thing Every foul in the box SHOULD be a penalty. But contact does not automatically equal foul and that should be the talking point. OMG really 😱😱  No shit mate, it’s just soft as fuck Refs already make subjective calls as to whether they think they're following the exact interpretation of the law but they clearly aren't consistent about it already.  I'd rather them actually use their brains on something like this. I was counting like stonewall penalties and handballs and objectively wrong decisions that led to goals for the first 10 games and it cost us like 8 points and after that I lost count because it was just so bad. The Watkins one was one of the most blatant penalties I've ever seen, and the Ramsey one, no attempt on the ball and clearly takes him out. Exactly, and those two will be back soon, and besides December is an absolute marathon and we came out of the other side in fairly good shape. There are only two league matches in January with plenty of rest and time for injured players to come back, we aren’t losing our best players to international duty either unlike some other teams, maybe we’ll do a thing or two on the transfer market - but even if not, there’s no reason to panic.  Got very lucky against Burnley but unlucky against Sheffield, swings and roundabouts.  Honestly, that Brentford game already looked stupid but in light of recent matches was utter insanity and I hope the manager laid into Martinez properly. We had 7 out of 9 points before Brentford, against three very good teams, then scraped 4 out of 9 in the next three games post-Brentford despite playing the two worst in the league at home. If that doesn’t help show how important Kamara is I don’t know what does. Losing him because of a silly avoidable red, and dropping five very winnable, very important points, hopefully stamps that kind of risky childishness out of our game. We’re very lucky Arsenal and Liverpool have also been dropping points. My only guess is you can't call it back since there was kinda an advantage played with the shot. Not sure the rules on that but seems logical that you can't shoot an then get a FK Do you run with your arms glued to your hip? The ball bounced behind him up to his hand lol You're right, but it's just another one of those things that the more ""rigid"" the rules get, it gets further away from the ""spirit of the game"".  Before VAR, a lot of offsides and penalties would never be called because they weren't ""clear and obvious"", but instead we have goals overturned by inches and diving rewarded in instances that they shouldn't be. [deleted] I just think the ref screwed up and since it was outside of the box it's not reviewable as a foul. [You're an idiot if you think this is a natural running movement](https://twitter.com/JJWatt/status/1741147269842583765?s=19). He literally flicks his hand at the ball to move it. I mean var had absolutely nothing to do with this, it's like people have such a hate boner for ""var"" they seem to forget how awful decisions used to be. Good points and I agree with you, it'll likely play out exactly as you described. Absolutely players should be punished more for diving or buying penalties from minimal contact, even if done after matches. I seem to remember they did this very briefly then scrapped it, like many other initiatives they've introduced over the years Probably true, good point Why would he flick it away from his body? If you're going to do that you're gonna hit it in front of himself to clear. Instead he opened up a shot for Forester  He was running with foster pressuring and got hit off balance (and forster might have even hit his arm but you can't tell from that angle).

Wish him all the best, I'm sure he'll be great for Juve.   Thought I was gonna be more alright with it but this has actually made me quite sad jealous This fucking sucks, only silver lining is he’s gone abroad and not to another prem team.  I’m sure he’ll be class for Juve. Gutted but glad he moved to a team outside the Premier League, and obviously we needed to sell for financial reasons anyway.  What a great player he's been for us, from fighting relegation in our first season back in the Prem to qualifying for the Champions League.  Wish him all the best. 50m € and will be paid in 4 installments Giuntoli is cooking with motta great trasnfer I remember his home debut for us. It was the 2-0 loss to Bournemouth where a Bournemouth player shouted him to leave the ball and he, probably not understanding English or his teammates very well, inexplicably let it run across the box for a Bournemouth player to bang it in.  Who knew he’d grow into such an important player for us… I think it’s the right move and I think we already have the players to replace him, but it’s still sad to see him go. Great transfer for Juventus. Juve planning with him as a 6? I will miss you Dougie you brought me so much happiness over the years Would have loved to see as many from the first Prem season back to be in the Champions League with Villa, such a good player and I'm devastated he's gone Him, K.Thuram, Fagioli and hopefully Koopmeiners are going to be a world class midfield Anxious to see what he can do in Serie A. Hopefully he's the beginning of a once again great midfield for us. What will happen to alisha lehman 🥲 Good luck Dougie. Thanks for everything xxx Shiiiit, so sorry to see him go. He's a quality player and I'd be even more gutted if I didn't have so much faith in the manager. fucking gutted Been our best player since promotion. Will always look back on him fondly. Great player. Hope he keeps progressing towards his potential. Very excited about this. Juve looking serious this window, also curious how Villa will replace him goodbye king The worst player in La Liga!  Enjoy Sunny Italy! Thanks for everything Dougie! You're gonna tear it up. Great player, really enjoyed watching him play.  Did we have any sell on clause?  Time to shimmy at Serie A! How to earn money playing in Europe 101 How to destroy your career 101 [deleted] if it’s any consolation i’d still be on the side of saying you probably got the better side of the transfer. 30 million plus illing jr and enzo is nothing to scoff at. both players have given us good performances and have massive potential. out of curiosity, what is Milan plan this summer ?   (I've almost seen no news at all on reddit other than the Lukaku rumor which will be hilarious if true tbh) Isn't the rumor Iling Jr and Barrenechea + 28m Euro? Do K Thuram next! I seriously can't believe we just signed a good midfielder. Cooked so hard he burned your future You can’t remember it that well, it was 2-1 and Dougie scored an absolute screamer. Arter, right?   I felt Luiz was always good against us, so I'm not sad he goes 😂 I hope not, he plays much better as a number 8.  He was forced into playing as a 6 at Villa for the second half of this season (as Kamara has been out injured) and he looked average at best. What made me laugh is he specifically requested for Alisha to be in the deal lmaooo she must be one heck of a woman he couldn't bear being away from her haha. Locatelli? Rabiot is leaving? He’s been one of their best midfielders she's part of the deal afaik 20% of theprofit i heard. Nah that's more like Guler He played almost every game, never injured and helped us to our greatest premier league finish in a long time.  Show some damn respect. > Massively overrated and bizarrely spoken of as if he was our greatest ever player on here.  If you weren’t trying to so hard to convince people you don’t rate him, someone might believe you. Well I am not going to pretend to know anything about those two players, but I do know Luiz is a baller. Fell off a little in the last few months but I'm putting that down to tiredness and missing Kamara behind him. He will absolutely be great again like he was for us for long periods thats the thing, we dont have a plan😭 seriously though, its been a month that we’re negotiating for zirkzee and we still have made like 0 progress, were also going for youssouf fofana but itll be pretty hard with pl interest and lastly we really want emerson royale for some reason To be financially stable and to have a semi competitive team to trick the majority like we’re trying to win without spending too much.   Milan currently is a real estate development company masquerading as a soccer team seperate deals now 🧂 Hahaha I was there that day and STILL forgot he scored 😂 I mainly remember the 1-2 shell shock of the immediate penalty followed by the aforementioned goal Yep amazing as an 8, wasted as a 6. He should also be taking all corners. Must suck for Juve women to realize that the team's decisions are made to appease the men's side.   Alisha is not nearly good enough of a footballer to offset the losses of Beerenstyn and Grosso. Selling him would be another Giuntoli's masterclass They want to keep him but his contract expire tomorrow and he hasn't take a decision yet, so probably he's still waiting for some team to offer him more money He’s asking for silly numbers His contract has just expired. Juventus' offer has been sitting on the table for weeks now, it was the player's decision to not renew it. Presumably he hasn't renewed because he wants a bigger deal, kinda like Chiesa [deleted] Oi Cafu was called the Brazilian Emerson royal I mean they're not really separate deals, just announced separately Ohh like Pjanic - Arthur. I’ve never really sat down to watch her any video I see of her on socials is not her playing it’s always these thirst trap kinda videos. She can’t be be if she has over 50 caps for Swiss women team… No 👎 that would be a huge mistake. Literally zero people have ever talked about him as though he’s Aston Villa’s best ever player, but hey, I’m sure you’ll have no problem getting another top 4 finish next season without him. Yeah but I think the values are fairer Lol yeah, she's more of an influencer than a footballer these days.  tbh the Swiss women's NT is not very good either. Depends on the fee and who are we gonna buy to replace him if anything they are lower so it reduces the sell on clause to man city"

This deal is crazy to me, Luiz is so good Think Illing Jr is a good signing even as a swap. Juventus have got an amazing deal here he about to cook for them 🍳 Feel like this is a bad deal for AV. I gather the swapping of players was in part to deal with financial rules? Exit details you say? Is this about the inheritance of his locker? Sad to see Wes go but Douglas is great signing. Coming off an incredible season at villa and he’s only 26. If Illing Jr doesn't reach his potential, this deal will be a big L for Villa. Is Rabiot going then? I don't think this is a bad trade. AV are in Europe so they'll need all the help they can get. They need to add a couple more guys atleast. Another striker atleast and someone that can split time with McGinn. This is a sad day. Fuck PSR  I know McKennie is a meme over here but Emery wants him and I trust Emery. UTV woah Aston Villa are getting scammed lmao.   Giuntoli masterclass Does anyone know how much karma you need to post? Fuck off Don’t leave, Dougie! Whatcha think about this deal Juve/Villa fans? Insert the Donald Trump deal meme right here: I'm going to be very sad when Illing-Junior does amazing for Villa next season. He's such a good player. Another club turns to Cobham and will be rewarded for it. I have the feeling English football has been started to **declining** since the beginning of this past season and many clues suggest me that.  I mean:   - Everton and Forest have been docked points after being found guilty of breaching the PL's  PSR. Several clubs (Villa, Newcastle and Leicester included) are obliged to sell some of their best players to not receive the same punishments, while Chelsea to avoid it had to start to affect their own assets (hotels). Manchester City have been hit by 115 charges and will face serious consequences next summer, with Pep already ready to leave the sinking ship as per reliable reports.  Manchester United look without hope and owners seems not interested to solve clubs' problems (as Old Trafford downfalls suggest), Tottenham have been accused of taking advatange of Ukraine war unfairly, Palace to improve current situation signed a contract with illegal betting company and West Ham will soon lose €75m patrimony (Paquetà) forever due to misconduct  - The new domestic TV right deal is much less lucrative, the **value** of each individual game has gone down by **50%** (source: https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/39229682/why-premier-league-new-tv-deal-warning-not-record). Also their international TV-right deals have bleed money as Scandinavia deal showed us.  - In Europe they've been very embarassing this season compared to the money spent in the transfermarkt with only 1 english team out of 12 in the SF suggesting that the flow might be changed.  - Their league has become almsot unwatchable due to absurd referee mistake every gameweek that make the games like a toin coss, the luckiest with ref wins.. So many mistakes that they even  decided to vote for the abolition of VAR some days ago..  Is it the beginning of the end? Only time will tell us [deleted] This will be the transfer of the summer, aston villa is preparing them selfs for the future!!! Will Emery manage to keep this fat fuck McKennie off the burgers? Why don’t arsenal go for this? ""BREAKING: Aston Villa to send Douglas Luiz to Juventus in exchange for Weston McKennie, Samuel Iling Jr and cash considerations"" Only a future draft pick is missing. ""Doug for TT, Shump and the nets pick. Who says no?"" Fab bomb Yeah but if he wants out what is Villa supposed to do?   McKennie has been somewhere between ok and pretty good everywhere except Leeds and Iling is lottery ticket.   It's not the worst deal. Is he a fullback or winger? Does he have legs/cover a lot of ground or is he more of a stationary player? Yea, the player value of the swapped players count within psr rules from whatever I have heard. Think City also have a sell on percentage that doesn’t take into account other involved players, but I might be wrong He’s making sure Ms Frattesi joins him He wants to take the club's Espresso Machine with him. Probably asking for his ranch sauce back and the club don't want to tell him they destroyed it If Rabiot going then we will desperately try to sign Koopmeiners. Lemme tell you about PSR. Gini plays wide midfield primarily, we already have players there, fullbacks would be the primary position of improvement especially right back and we also desperately need someone to fill in for kamara. He was meme here too until last season where he was one of our POTS, he was also fairly impressive during his first year too. Hes a good player if the manager can get his best It feels weird to judge McKennie on a stint that was more than a year ago.  Are we suddenly worse than Leeds to be taken into consideration? If Terrorist Allegri can get somthing out of Weston then I’m sure Emery will be able to. Hopefully it'll just be June that's a nightmare. With the extra revenue for next year we might have room for some spending. I'm so glad to see us moving on McKennie. To me he perfectly reflects this mediocre at best team the last few years. Huge impact on the books for players with 1 year of contract If only Napoli could have kept him. It's less about being scammed and more forced into it due to PSR. I have no doubt that without that issue we would not accept this deal. Villa fans seem sad to see Luiz go so that sounds good for us Iling jr is so bad we’re about to get docked points again for making villa agree to a 25m value EPL clubs are so rich even ac milan struggles to compete with bournemouth on transfer targets other than prestige Rabiot underperforming??? You had me until rabiot ""And 2025 first round draft pick plus 2026 second round draft pick"" TT + Shump + Nets pick Woj bomb. I feel very bad for McKennie tbh, he became good in a mediocre team yes we have some good names, but we had no plans nor intensity, and the position that Allegri was playing him (a hybrid between CM and attacking winger) is almost impossible for him to excel at in the PL, he simply don't have the speed nor the technics (both dribbling and crossing) nor the passing vision.  Illing is the opposite though, he is a very quick winger with nice dribbling skills, he reminds me a lot of young cuadrado.   if Aston Villa turn him into a starter and somehow find the right position for McKennie, this could be a good deal for them.  &nbsp;  Edit:   Forgot AV has Emery as a coach, he reminds me a lot of Allegri when i watch him, so maybe McKennie will excel under him too. I think it’s more making sure we comply with FFP before this years June 30th deadline, rather than this originating initially for him.   I’m sure hes happy with the move, I just don’t think he was the one that started it is my point  Winger who has played a few games as a left wingback. I don't think he has ever played fullback. Played decent as a full back this season but he's a winger through and through, good pace, 1v1 type of player. Good at crossing in the box as well. More of a winger Winger. He cant defend for his life More known for his quality on the ball than his off the ball work Tbh he can do both, but mostly better with the ball. Set piece delivery is also excellent. He could do with some legs beside him but he’s not physically incompetent. Him and Kamara were a great partnership That's the explanation he needs. They already broke up. For how much money Atalanta wants for him, the only way we can afford Koopmeiners is if we sell Chiesa and/or Soulé. What does PSR mean? Edit: I read about PSR. How does this affect Villa? I'm just a faraway fan and I don't keep up with the financial stuff 😁 Sounds like Ndombele 😂 The 1971 Fairs Cup Final will give you your answer. He was one of your best three players this season and that was despite him constantly being played out of position. Fuck off Don't think Napoli fans would want to hear Greenwood's deal. If you put him in the right conditions he'll be one of your best players, in the first half of the season he was arguably the best midfielder in the league and I'm not saying that just because of villa bias, he was playing that well. We don't play terror ball but unai is very good at improving players. hes basically exclusively played as a wingback in the first team, and the occasional terrible performance in central midfield Thanks Interestingly enough, we are giving the potential legs besides him away in this deal. Sad, Davide can finally unblock his sister We’ve been right at the edge of what we are allowed to spend this year so need to sell a player or face sanctions. Opposite, to be more precise. He work hard but lack technical skill. Well he wasn't really played out of position, he was played where he performed best by far. I'd argue that last season McKennie was played in his best position, that's why he was able to perform so well Lmao are you a butthurt American?  this is one of the worst squads I've seen us have, so him being one out best players this season means little. I'd sell asap.  He's not good enough to lock down a position at an elite club. He's got good work rate and heading but a bad first touch. Jack of a few trades, master of none. Yes, the city with some of the highest rates of violence in Europe and some of the highest rates of domestic violence in Italy would be soooo alarmed at the arrival of a man who pathetically and shamelessly beats and assaults his partner.   You wouldn’t hear a peep of complaints from Italian Napoli fans lol. Delusional and uninformed really. I don’t think that will happen but I would not put it past juventus either, seeing as they had Cristiano. i checked the stats and was actually surprised, you scored a lot more than us (54 vs 76) but you also accept A LOT more (31 vs 61) which something am surprised about, at least based on the few times i watched Villarreal under Emery. You would know more than myself, my understanding was that he was mostly a winger through the youth ranks and then played at wingback at juventus for the last season or two He can cover ground fine, you need to put a proper 6 next to him, not mckennie. Someone who can sit there and clean up and allow him to dictate the game, ideal to have one he can dovetail with and play combinations with. I was talking about the good manager to get the best out of him part Ok you have a point Ofc, their bullshit fans will start buying his shirt after he scores his first goal Cristiano’s case got conveniently reopened after he had already signed for Juve lol Injuries to our defensive midfield and central defence ya thats why i said the first team. in the next gen he played winger I see, but I don't think there's any manager could make Ndombele works if it's not coming from himself Yes, I mean their supreme club legend was a junkie mixed up with the mafia who is accused by numerous women, including minors, of rape, sexual assault and violence. They named their stadium after him after the allegations, that are heavily evidenced, arose 😭. They couldn’t care less.   https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/maradona-mavys-alvarez-rego-abuse-rape-b1962728.html injuries are part of the game, half of the memes about Allegri wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for absent players Except Mourinho, those certain  2 weeks Tho if this actually happen I would be glad to see their violance records resulting unexpected twist like the fans doing their own justice to punish Greenwood first before letting him join the training camp or officially signed with the club lol.     I mean you never know which side of coins you'll get first when you joining a new 'family' even with the same blood right.    And Maradona was already a hero for them long before he worst side start to afloat on public if I'm not mistaken, so I guess they just let it slide. You won’t find me disputing that. Just a reminder: you asked why we conceded so many goals vs Emery’s usual benchmark, I gave you one potential explanation. Fan fiction unfortunately fair enough"

Pay them themselves same as well I respect the work and dedication of every pro athlete.  But they don’t « do the same job » ! I hate this. The highest earning models are women but you don’t see anyone complaining about that, even though they’re ”doing the same job” They should swap teams so she can see if it's the same job. If you actually learn the reasons why he is paid that much more, it actually is perfectly fair.   People still saying this shit are either just ignorant to how money works or are just thick. From the very limited impressions I got from her footballing ability by scrolling through social media and seeing short clips of her ball control and technique, I'm surprised she can actually make any kind of money with football. Would you complain if you were both musicians but he was way better and more people listened to his music so he made way more money? Only good thing about selling Dougie was getting rid of her I played football all my life, never made me a dime. I even had to pay for it! Not fair :( I don’t know why it’s so hard to understand for these people that the salary of a footballer is based on how much money the player can bring in to the club from sponsorships, tv deals, shirt sales and others.   Women’s football objectively does not pull the same viewership numbers as men’s football, and that leads to companies spending less money on sponsorships, and tv deals, meaning the clubs get less money to spend on salaries.   It’s like complaining that the striker from your local non-league club doesn’t earn the same salary as Haaland, despite them both “doing the same job.” ""Not enough money to buy a rolex, I begged Speed to buy one for me but he refused to do so! That short bastard"" In entertainment/sport it has always been this way  There are actors doing the same job as the rock getting barely anything Goal have played a blinder here. Take a quote out of context from a longer interview and they immediately get so many clicks from people rushing to lecture her. This is new? I thought they broke up. If you ain’t drawing a dime then you won’t get paid all that much. If women’s football can up its levels over the next decade I could see them getting paid near enough the same as men’s football. This again, its not your capability or anything in comparison to any gender, its related to the revenue you generate. Clubs don’t earn on women football as much as men football. This is a fact not a sexist issue. I have never seen even women interested in women football… It sucks, but Womens footy is gaining popularity just look at the last world cup etc, their professional game is improving a heap and it looks a lot more marketable than it was a decade or two ago Biggest myth in this world is that hard work = lots of money  Also this is not the same job in the slightest [Bill Burr appropriate comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I745Ajeq_B8) ... The money comes from the fans willing to pay for quality soccer. It's not a gender issue. Players in Europe and around the world are getting paid differently based on their quality and the quality of the league. I wish they got paid less in the premier League and we could watch the games as a game for all and not just people who can pay multiple content providers squeezing us for every penny. The same content providers would love to take more of our money if the women's game had the same following. They do not discriminate when it comes to profits. What should male models tell female models? Damn you do the same thing, but you earn so much more than me. Women are not watching football, they have other interests. Mainly. What about male models??? Honestly people who think like this lack a brain. How irrational is this take... Oh no, an entertainment job where not many people are interested in watching pays less, how unfair... Thats like demanding that every street musician should get the same money as taylor swift, Poor boy Douglas Luiz, having to hear this every day at home and not being able to tell her.. That women failed women football. As long as their numbers are lower than men football, they will make less money. That's it, I said it 😔 Every single person that says this crap needs to sit down and watch bill burr. First, because it's hilarious. But more importantly, because he lays tells you exactly why you don't make as much. Spoiler alert, it isn't because you are a woman. It's because literally tiny fraction of the general public give a fuck about your sport. Is she stupid? You do NOT have the same job! Nobody recognizes you (she might even be the excpetion because she does social media) on the street and nobody really cares about what you do too... You don’t hear bitch about you making more on only fans. I would like to say has anyone actually read the interview she gave in La Republica? because i have looked everywhere and haven't seen ANYONE actually have the original quote and context which this was allegedly said? The part of the article that is available on la republica doesn't have anything like this quote in it Lmao this place is going to have an absolute meltdown I can tell Its funny how entire thread is trying to politely explain the most obvious thing. Guys every person who has iq higher than room temperature gets it except feminists. There's nothing to discuss except Alisha stupidity. No one really wants to watch you kick it half as hard, though Alisha. ""It's not sexist, women's football makes less money.""      And why does it make less money? Could there be something in the history of the sport, in the history of our cultures that caused that? Who knows. Reddit certainly doesn't. The mental gymnastics in this comments section to deny her clearly true statement [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Or they are politicizing the issue for their own benefit. For example, the US Women's National Team used this strategy very effectively to raise their pay. They had to know that it was not an honest argument, but it worked for them.  I know footballers can be thick, but I don't see how you can say ""It's not fair, they get paid so much more than me for doing the same job"" and not immediately have a thought of ""But why is that though?""  I would love to have seen the interviewer put that question to her. Because I think there is a productive conversation that can be had about it - if the reason is ""Women's football isn't as popular"" then ""Well what can we do to make it more popular?"" is a natural follow-up. But just saying ""It's not fair"" is a conversational and rhetorical dead-end. You can't really claim its objective though, it's due to the commercialisation of the sport.  The best footballers earn alot more than the best rugby players. Are they more skillful? Is that 'fair'?  This conversation will always be a bit dumb. Like yeah, obv the best men are better athletes, and the mens football pyramid is significantly more competitive than the women's.  But there's more money in women's tennis than there is in many mens sports. It's not really about objectivity. The money she makes through football are clearly not related to her ability and she knows that Which is a valid criticism of the entertainment industry. People who aren’t superstars are not being paid enough for their work. Yet the moment a female athlete wishes for a pay raise, these criticisms suddenly disappear What is the full context? Original article in paywalled Got back together, and both were transferred to Juventus from Villa, presumably part of the agreement for Luiz to go to Juventus was that they were a package deal >I have never seen even women interested in women football…  Lol do you think that things don't exist if you don't observe them? Like this is just obvious nonsense > I have never seen even women interested in women football…  Really? I know loads. My partner has a season ticket for arsenal women's now for example and is in a group of 8 girls. She's also going with her mum next month.   Obviously it's not as popular as men's football without saying but thought the last bit was odd. > I have never seen even women interested in women football…  Sounds like a you problem. I believe huge part of that is that women were actively discouraged from playing football for most of 20th century, you can't generate revenue if you are being actively shunned away from taking part. So sexism was involved from the very start. There are sports like tennis that potentially show women can bring equal revenues when they are given equal footing. I'm not that educated on the issues however, obviously big difference between indivdual vs team sport as well. There's definitely potential for women football to attract a more moderate match going fanbase, families etc, nice day out without bumping into a cokehead at every turn. Women’s football is becoming much more popular. My girlfriend watches it way more than men’s football and so does her mother. The quality is rapidly improving. > Clubs don’t earn on women football as much as men football. This is a fact not a sexist issue.  And how is that not a sexism issue? Why do you think, mens football is more popular?   At least in England, Women's footbal used to attract as large crowds as the men's game, before the FA banned it. For sexist reasons. She made 2 points in her statement, neither of which are true. First he doesn't make hundreds of thousands times more than her. Secondly it's not unfair coz it's literally how it works in terms of revenue and popularity of women's football compared to men's football I play Sunday league, which is the same game that Douglas Luiz is playing, so I should probably get a couple hundred thousand per week too (based on your rock-solid logic) 🤦‍♂️  You seem to be unfamiliar with the concepts of “supply” and “demand.” Or with the fact that there are levels to this. Or, perhaps, you’re being intentionally disingenuous. Regardless, she gets paid less for a reason that has nothing to do with what you’re implying it does 🤷‍♂️ It’s true, but it’s perfectly fair.  If very few people want to pay to watch her play, she doesn’t “deserve” to make as much money as her boyfriend. A. You don’t know how money works  B. You don’t care about football   Pick one People only invest where they see opportunity for profit.  Anything beyond that is charity. And the main reason for that is that it wouldn’t generate as much profit as an investment in the men’s game would. Sponsors don’t pay as much money to be seen at women’s games because not many people will watch. People don’t buy shirts from women’s teams because they don’t watch them play. Even the effort being put in to women’s football is tied to how much money they bring in.  So, yes, it is that simple. Progress takes time.  The state of women’s football is miles better today than it was a decade ago. It’s travelling in the right direction but was never going to gain parity overnight. The investment will come over time. Because at the end of the day the women's game will never earn as much money bc it's a less entertaining product Different levels of skill required mate 👍🏽 and also obviously commercial side I mean isn't it the same with modeling? I assume women modelling is more popular/profitable so they make more too The cynical side of me wants to say that they know exactly why they don’t get paid as much as men, and know that they can’t really argue against it because it makes perfect sense. By playing the sexist card, it’s kind of shaming those that pay them into increasing their pay as they don’t want to be seen as sexist. it worked for them because the media was more than willing to scream ""sexism"" over and over again until US soccer was shamed into giving them more money If you play in a sport that generates more revenue, it’s just simple economics that you’d be paid more than those who play in less lucrative sport. It’s nothing to do with skill, it’s everything to do with who brings in more money. so now she should stand up for beautiful man who cant get a job at Juve because of lack of football skills. Its unfair! So she’s already riding her boyfriend’s coattails to get signed at clubs that don’t even want her based on her ability, and still finds a reason to complain about earning too little. Talk about entitlement. Wild. I never heard about any of this when Luiz was transferred. Yup i thought ppl needed brain to function but here you are A sexist decision made in 1921 that was undone 50 years ago.  Womens football in England does not have the commercial draw or the attendances.  The Womens Championship (possibly Super League as well) are showing games free on Youtube. Newcastle Women had a record attendance of 7k last season, in a 10k stadium, in a city that is football obsessed. We also had 61k that watched us v the London City Lionesses on youtube, compared to 16k that watched Bristol City v Birmingham.  Compare that to the 30k that attended the Wolves v Newcastle match yesterday, a game that was also shown on Sky Sports and other channels worldwide to a much larger audience.  Womens football is growing, but until attendances and viewership start to reach levels comparable to the mens game, sponsors are not going to offer the same amount of money, so wages will be lower.  The Womens Super League, as of 12 months ago, was averaging around 6k attendance per game, with an average of 25k if only counting fixtures in bigger grounds. The Premier League by comparison averaged 38k per game and the Championship 22k.  Womens football is growing, but it will take time. As more teams start to push the game, more matches are played in bigger grounds and more people start to watch the money in the game will increase.   Keep in mind that the most expensive signing in womens football is $860k paid by Real Madrid. That money does not even get you a Championship level player in the mens game. Angel City was sold this year at a higher valuation than Fiorentina was 3 years ago ($250m vs $180m). Seems like there's some opportunity for money there! Less skilled does not equal less entertaining though. A bunch of guys I work with think the WNBA is way more fun than the NBA for example  You are the reason for the /s [deleted] Yes, that’s exactly what I was saying lol I mean, if you're being fair, the USWNT averaged 1.56 million viewers per game in 2023, compared to the USMNT averaging 1.32 million viewers per game over the same time period.  So...I'd say they more than earned that equal pay. If nothing else, they're still underpaid compared to the men, given how they've easily outperformed them over the years. So the best women's tennis players earning more than the best male squash players is 'fair'? Because fair just means 'sport with more money'? Guess it shows that there is still some way to go for women's football to be seen as equal in the media! Could have easily been covered in the Luiz deal given that Villa also saw a couple of players come their way from Juventus as part of the deal too. If anything it's pretty interesting seeing the two transfer to Juventus, can't be that often that a team buy two players in a relationship together Ironically, this comment needs to be redirected back to you I follow the NWSL, if you want to see the many women interested in women's soccer you're free to watch the games and see the women in the crowd! That's all well and good, but you're comparing a likely overvalued asset that's an outlier as the most expensive club in women's football, to a mid tier club in the 5th/6th league.  What's the 2nd most expensive women's club worth? Based on attendance figures, both on site and on TV, there are very few people who think that, which is what matters when it comes to income generated. > A bunch of guys I work with think the WNBA is way more fun than the NBA for example   lmao who the fuck do you work with? i've never run across a single person that thinks this Which is why these complaints are fucking stupid. You generate more, you earn more. If a women's sport generates more than the man's version of it it would also make sense for the women to earn more. Same reason Mbappé earns more in a week than someone in the 4th tier does in a year. So you and OC were making the same point in the first place but you just called them an idiot for no reason… Well then we clearly agree on the subject haha. Got a feeling that that sort of tactic will only really work in the US and maybe the UK though. Other countries seem to have a bit more common sense when it comes to things like this, whereas those 2 seems more worried about not offending others than actually doing the sensical thing. world cup year for women vs no world cup for men? you don't think that's lying by omission on your part? Look into the whole situation. They agreed to a lower variance deal than the men did because they wanted to secure guaranteed money. Which makes total sense given average salaries in the NWSL. But you can't take the lower variance deal and then complain after you perform well that you should have taken the incentive based deal. Yes. The women’s tennis player has far more people watching her, therefore far more sponsors want to pay her, the tournament and the broadcasters far more money to promote their products.   The more popular the athlete/team, the more tickets sold and people watching on TV, more eyeballs on her also means more eyeballs on her sponsors, the sponsors of the tournament and the adverts on the TV broadcast. If more people see the sponsors/ads, the more likely someone will think to spend their money on the product. That’s why men’s football generates so much more money than women’s and they’re able to pay much higher wages to get the best players. There’s also only a limited amount of professional players, so supply and demand comes in alongside all of that, the better the player, the more scarce that level of quality, then the higher the demand for them is, and therefore the higher the price.   I don’t get why people find this so hard to understand. If you bring in more money, it’s only right that you get paid more money. Also if a resource is scarce, it naturally costs more, even more so if you’re competing with others to buy it.   It’s not about being fair or right, it’s simple economics. Being fair shouldn’t even come into it because it literally doesn’t matter at all. Obviously he knows they’ll be women fans at a women’s game, he’s saying none of his friends, colleagues, family members, acquaintances are into women’s football, which is a fair comment. He’s clearly not saying that women who watch women’s football don’t exist. >mid tier club in the 5th/6th league.  Serie A Is the 3rd best league in Europe. 4th at worst. Fine, I'll bite. England, Spain, who else is better than Serie A other than those 2? San Diego Wave at $120 million. Portland Thorns at $63 million is third I believe. In Europe Lyon got bought by Michelle Kang for around 50 million Euros. Either way, if you want to talk about profit, with NWSL teams we're talking about clubs that went from being sold in the single digit millions as recently as 2020 to now being sold in the double to triple digit millions. I would argue that now is the perfect time to invest, money you put in now will get you significantly higher returns in the years to come. People who don't give a shit about the NBA but follow college sports religiously. Especially with how much Caitlyn Clark has given prominence to the woman's sport.   I know more people who think every sport but hockey players are overpaid.   People have weird opinions just because of what they are exposed to. I agree. Its also why the women's usa soccer team was able to actually get a paimy raise several years ago..they are miles better than the mens team. Yea, the woke disease is the biggest in the West, but with the spread of technology and social media, it's in every country at some degree now, mainly with the younger generations. World Cup in Australia where matches are on in the middle of the night and they got knocked out early vs host nation Gold Cup & Nations League final. You don't think that's lying through omission on your part? > It’s not about being fair or right, it’s simple economics.  Yeah, so, contraditing what you first said, 'fair' isn't the right word. Then perhaps Alisha Lehmann should get good enough to play in NWSL then. They're getting subsidized by the men's team because they took on FIFA and lost. I know you’re agreeing with me, but the phrase ""woke disease"" has to be one of the cringiest sayings. it's fair in an economic sense because women's tennis generates exponentially more interest and thus revenue than squash. athletes don't get paid in terms of relative skill but in terms of viewership. It’s fair in economic terms, which is the only thing that should matter when it comes to what is fair pay. It’s hard for me to really articulate, but the concept of it not being based on what’s seen as fair, makes it fair, if you get what I’m saying. If players were paid based on the idea of fair that Lehmann and the USWNT see as being fair, things would actually be very unfair as players would be earning money that they aren’t making and others would be making money that someone else is getting paid.  It’s also funny that Alisha Lehmann of all players is coming out saying this as she is one of the most high profile and marketed female footballers, yet she’s not even close to being one of the best, so she’s being a bit of a hypocrite here. Guess i didnt pay enough attention to that story lol. Fair enough, I was just describing exactly what you explained right there in the last sentence. I do understand that this is still Reddit."

As a city fan I had to chuckle, this period of like 5 minutes straight where Villa pulled our pants down, got it in the box, and we cleared right back to them and did it all over again. I thought I was watching the game. When did I open Pornhub? Ederson back to his feet by the time someone else got to the ball Lovely centre forward play from Watkins here to link up City are so washed To think he was “on the market” for a stint in the summer and we bought fucking kovacic and nunes *gets ball and looks up*  ""Oh, free shot."" The angle behind looked like ederson got a finger to it, am I seeing things ? Thankfully the stats are.  22 shots to 2 Thank fuck that didn't happen or this would have been such a heartbreaker. City stopped playing football after the first 10 minutes each half Granted They arent psg lol Loved that we had 3 attempts back to back where every time it ended up being cleared to Pau Torres who immediately started another passage of play resulting in a chance Please leave the teasing fetish section Our performance last night has overshadowed Dias having a very good game limiting Watkins last night. I still think he had a good game, but was starved of chances due to excellent defending by Dias. he was never on the market lol, maybe last summer with gerrard in charge, but he's not that far from grealish levels of importance for us, the only reason he isn't is because the rest of the squad is so good He has been the best midfielder this season. I know im biased, but have watched every minute of him and he has been outstanding Kovacic is an amazing player, it’s your own fault you’re not using him. Wasn't Liverpool interested in him and Villa just told them to fuck off What did they do with all that time on their hands Cleared to Torres in the same way and Haaland was the same distance away each time Torres was so fucking good. I heard some City fan previews saying to put balls on his head caus he's bad in the air. Didn't look that way to me! Not to mention we had him on our books for a while and just decided he wasn’t worth pushing for a visa for after it got rejected the first time We almost bought him last January before he signed the new contract.  Emery is absolutely cooking though   The players knew exactly what to do in every situation. The press is relentless I'd say it's really close between him and Rice. He's just brilliant to watch and absolutely killing it for you guys! He might be a good player but you can see that in this play, he was in the field and he was nearest to Douglas Luiz than Bernado Silva that comes running behind him to mark Douglas Luiz as Kovacic don't do it. Kovacic just stays there marking no one Get topped Everyone knows that mate I know you never put in an offer but it was never close.   It's like how we ""almost"" bought ESR haha. You didn’t almost buy him lol. He was never coming. Kovacic definitely needs to show the urgency Bernardo did considering it’s clear that douglas has all the space in the world to shoot from but that doesn’t change the fact that Douglas was already supposed to be marked by Nunes who gets bypassed by the simplest passes and gets caught in no mans land doing absolutely nothing."

This is robbery Aston Villa getting robbed lmao 65 million on the books for Villa. Luiz is a class player but needs to play next to a destroyer to maximize his potential and Luiz fell off massively after the Kamara injury. He also has had a contract extension in front of him for 6 months and hasn’t signed. Villa needed to sell before June 30th and he is the most replaceable. Villa have a lot of money to play around with starting July 1st due to new sponsorships. Look for them to pursue Alex Baena as the Luiz replacement I seen rumors Alesha Lehmann is moving to Italy too as they're dating - is there any truth to this or is it just a transfer rumor that writes itself? who are they going to sign as a replacement if they’re still financially in trouble? barrenechea is definitely not ready Juve Villa deal seemingly beneficial to Juve.  Villa Chelsea deal seemingly beneficial to Villa.  Waiting for the next set of player swaps between Chelsea and Juve where Chelsea benefits now. That is an absolutely diabolical deal for Villa. Gonna miss him so much. Juventus are getting a top, top player. Daylight robbery lmao I hope this guy is as good as people are saying. I don't know anything about the players in the prem lol  Also rip Iling Junior, but I guess it had to be done. I never hated him but it was pretty obvious Allegri didn't know what to do with him. I'm guessing Motta felt the same. Id follow Lehman anywhere too tbh its a really good deal for Juve thats for sure. “When I read about swap deals I know it’s a bullshit” /s I usually tend not to judge a deal before we see any of said players in action for their clubs but, holy cow this is a daylight robbery Aston Villa got robbed lmao thought this was Douglas Costa for a second Juve what are you doing City get a percentage They didn't want McKennie cause he wanted to be paid like a star on the team McKennie is a fucking joke, we dodged a nuclear bomb by him demanding an obscene wage and bonus. That bad? It saves us for PSR purposes and Luiz wouldn't sign a new deal so was probably getting sold as he only had 2 years left. Lets wait and see what Emery does with these lads, Luiz is over rated anyway, been awful since January and we looked better without him. Luiz forced the deal anyway by not signing a contract we offered in Jan and has been in a huff since, good riddance to him.  Assuming Emery can bring out the potential of these 2, (which he has done with literally every single player in our squad since he came) this is a great deal for us. I think Tielemans from last summer is Luiz replacement with Barkley joining for cheap to replace Tielemans in the squad.    Heard good things about Baena but with Buendia coming back as well as our other attackers I'm not sure what space there is  I see the term “destroyer” and I downvote. That’s some video game nonsense. It's true I dont think they will. ive seen some villa fans say they’ll go through a formation change this year, especially with now signing both Maatsen + Illing, and swapping a young CM with a young LW with Everton  Mings and Kamara should be back fit this year to play 3 atb with Kamara playing alongside Tielemans/McGinn + they still have Ramsey/Barkley  I wonder if Ramsey will play more centrally with all the new attacking talent on the left hand side Kamara is the starter at DM. Barrenechea will be his sub. I thought he had a good season at Frosinone though? We're only in trouble until the end of June. We will do a tonne of business in the rest of the summer including a replacement for Luiz. Weren't they in PSR trouble just for the previous financial year? I would presume they can still make some signings after July Tielemans is more than enough They need to get a DM in case Kamara is out again both sides are happy with this one, tbh. Luiz goes with our best wishes and we're excited to see what the new players can offer once Emery has worked with them for a little while If all of the Villa fans are content with it then you should assume it isn't. Fixing mistakes of previous management and trying to exit our banter era 😂 There's a lot of rumors floating around.  One of them says that Juve wanted Villa to pay out his contract of about 5 million and Villa didn't want to.  Also, what are the top people at Villa being paid today?  Mckennie is on about 2.5 million a year currently. Premface jabronis think because he had a bad season at Leeds he’s terrible lmao i have no idea what barrenechea has actually done to be seen as good, he's looked like a midtable serie a player at most to me > Luiz is over rated anyway,  Fuck off, been played out of position since Kamara got injured and completely overworked because he's basically always available bar card accumulation. Absolute nonsense I think we'll sign a proper replacement for Luiz, Barkley will mostly compete with McGinn for a place in the side.  Not sure there will be room for Buendia by the time we've finished, could be on the fringes or loaned out to try and regain some form and value. what would you call it? out of interest It will probably be Tielemans/Kamara and Mings/Torres/Konsa with McGinn playing further forward tbh. With Barkley as Tielemans sub  I would be shocked if that happens tbh.  Fully expect us to play the same formation: 4-4-2 without the ball, usually 3-2-2-3 with the ball as the right back drops deep and the left wing back bombs forward.  We will sign a proper Luiz replacement. Ramsey will continue to play in the left central attacking midfield role. He is still very rough for first team futbol in a team that did really well last season in PL Yes. Anyone that expects us to be quiet after all these swap deals are finished is in for a bit of a shock. How many signings do you guys need do you think to have a squad big enough to compete in the league and the new extended champions league?   As an Arsenal fan looking at our fixture list it all looks pretty daunting with all the games they are expected to play and stay competitive. By signing a second Locatelli lol? Not by signing Douglas Luiz… [deleted] no he's definitely a huge talent, but I mean its all potential until he can get to that level. Was among the top 3 in progressive passes, tackles, interceptions and ariel duels among U23 midfielders in top 5 leagues. The lad can play for sure Where did we have him? Left back? Cop on, so he had to have his initial position be like 5y further back without Kamara covering behind. He played as an 8 with Kamara, as an 8 with McGinn, and as a 6 with Tielemans (which wasn't very often).  Overworked? The entire fucking squad was overworked but they still put in a shift every game, Cash, Tielemans, Zani all playing through injuries just to get us over the line while Luiz just walked around in midfield making simple passes. He was great for us at the start of the season, and has been decent in the past, but the last few months he has been absolutely appalling and if you disagree then you didnt watch the games since Christmas. Aren’t they just ball winning midfielders? Any rumours of targeting another RB/RWB to backup Cash if fullbacks are getting more forward?  Even with Diego Carlos being able to backfill on CB, 3 atb means more minutes/stress at the CB position, and cant imagine Chambers is rated to the level your ambition is Especially being in CL. We have seen a lot of times how taxing it can be. Atleast you guys were in Europe last time, so you just need to improve depth by a bit and some quality. Will be interesting to see how you guys strengthen tbh Even if you don't rate him that much, for this price it's a good deal. When will you guys realize it's not the prem, it's the team they are going to that matters. Plenty of mediocre players became stars or solid players in the prem too. It’s almost like different leagues and styles require different player profiles.   Because Mckinnie is better suited to Italy doesn’t mean he’s shit. Let’s not forget that English clubs got embarrassed across all three continental competitions last season. I don't care about if he comes from another league, most of our best players did but he's just not that good. I don't need overpriced prem players, I need good players. Yeah we've been heavily linked with Dumfries but I can't see him realistically coming to us - although I've also seen Cash linked to both Milan teams so who knows anymore, nothing makes sense. I think we definitely need RWB options as Cash doesn't suit Emery that much. Might promote Kessler-Hayden to be a more regular squad member as a wing back but you'd think we'd need one more.   Unless the new kid we signed from Serbia is already ready to go. Spent a fair bit on him so maybe he's going to be the starter  I can’t argue with that. But what’s the purpose when you have a better player in Manu Locatelli? [deleted] Locatelli? Are you joking? He's been terrible. Wasn't even called up to the NT. Lmao Gallagher cutting it in the prem but Pirlo can’t. Go to sleep bro you’re embarrassing the badge Yeah when I watched Pirlo regularly play against premier league teams in the UCL and have more passes than their entire midfield I’d often think this is a guy that couldn’t cut it going against Wigan and Blackpool   Actually shut up if you simply don’t watch football to this extent, just stop talking if you’re this clueless He was poorly used by Allegri. Don't judge him based on that terrorist. [deleted] Some things are not dependant on the coach. Locatelli is just not that good a player. PIRLO PLAYED AGAINST MATERAZZI AND CHIEVO, HE WOULD NOT SUFFER DUE TO RYAN SHAWCROSS AND BOLTON  You shouldn’t legally be allowed to watch football, and I’m not being hyperbolic Haha, we'll see. Allow Motta to get his hands on him and come back to this. I sure hope he somehow has a good season, but I've watched every Juventus game that Locatelli played in and I think it's pretty obvious that he has very big limitations overall."

I read from some Villa fans that he really fell off when Kamara was injured which is really concerning. We don’t have a dedicated CDM and that could’ve been Barrenechea Illing and Enzo just got assigned so much Emery homework [Villa's accountant rn](https://imgur.com/gallery/gunna-writing-heat-drjoVcm) I have no idea how we pulled that off, are Villa that desperate? I doubt you are reading this but I love you Dougie. Thank for the journey Getting Illing-Junior as part of the deal is great business Farewell Dougie, we'll miss him, but the Gods of PSR demanded a sacrifice, so here we are. Good signing for juve Dougie for Fee + 2 players  Kellyman + Duran (possible) for Matsen?  Tim for Dobbin  So many swap deals. Fuck PSR man Villa got robbed here. McKennie could've atleast been good for them. We got a swap deal before GTA6 PSR gerrymandering at its finest. The swap deal with McKennie would have been fair but this is a robbery. Bewildering how no big Prem team rly tried to get Luiz How good is Barrenechea? accountants cooking Alot of people underrating Barrenechea. Hes a good young player. [deleted] Taprizio about to milk this for another month What happened to McKennie?  How do these deals work from PSR pov?

Almost unbelievable. [deleted] He did, but he might also have just got tired, he played almost every game when he was available, and the Kamara injury forced us to play him a bit deeper where he's not as effective. So I wouldn't panic about that, he's still a quality player. Could Thuram be that player? If rumours are true he might be heading to Juve too [more like](https://x.com/VideoReacts/status/1536821656664035328?t=n2BNcbdOJ64G9C7bGrQ8OQ&s=19) Nah, Alisha Lehmann just really wanted to play for Juventus. Luiz doesn’t want to extend. We already have a replacement in the squad, he blows really hot but also not been that great all of his spell here. Essentially towards end of his first season in Project restart and first half of this season he’s been phenomenal but aside from that rather average at times Flew too close to the sun Depends on what the fees end up being. If they're comically large, it could let Villa spend on a better replacement than McKennie. Ssshhh you’re involved with us too You're underrating Barrenechea Who knows - and he's not that young. Just 2 years less than McKennie Real Madrid fan discovers youth prospects He’s decent and young. Could become a very good player Is wether you know a player supposed to determine whether that player is good or not? It’s not that bad, we need to sell by end of the month. Youri will slot right into the Luiz role and has been far better in the second half of last season anyway  Also add to that Luiz doesn’t want to extend anyway so it’s sell now or cut price next year or even free in 2 years Rumours popped up the other the day that FC Cincinnati are trying to sign him.  Not sure if that story has legs or not It’s most definitely not 35 From villa reddit the general opinion seems to be very dissapointing but some sees it as a best outcome out of a dissapointing situation type of thing. Which is the fact that Luiz didnt want to extend his contract and they needed to cash in on something due FPP issues Yea, amazing deal.  2 unproven youth projects plus some cash for one of the ~6 best Prem midfielders. Great deal for Villa 🤣🤣 Nah there's nothing fishy about this. It's a consequence of PSR for us and Italian teams being poor so offering players instead of a full fee. I don't know the PSR rules, but if I had to guess this deal only happened because no other club was willing to offer what Villa asked (needed) for him and since the accounting valor is the important thing right now then the trade offer was ok? Never really liked her anyway 😭 In italy various sources reported a valuation of 50 million euros for Douglas What kind of additional fees are you talking about?   Says Iling Jr. + Barrenechea + 28mil euros fee. For like, multiple players. Kellyman for £20m and then Duran for £40m? The Dougie move plus those two should get us out of PSR trouble I think  Can we finally start making moves now Enzo played his first season last year in Serie A at 23 and was unremarkable. He was okay at best. Can't believe all the Juve fans massively overrating him.  Enzo is a sideways passing defensive mid player that doesnt offer really anything going forward. Hes fine depth but thats it McKennie is a player that you could very well sell for 40m after the excellent season he's had  Barranechea is worth 10m or so. He's not very young and his season at Frosinone was alright. Fagioli would be the one worth a lot, and obviously you're not selling him. Yeah with Kamara coming back I don’t think Luiz will be that sorely missed  Although his set piece taking skills will definitely be difficult to replace Yeah, no one wanted to sell Dougie, but in the circumstances with his contract ticking down and needing to make a big sale for PSR purposes, someone needed to be sacrificed and he was the obvious choice. Not selling him to another PL club is a plus, and we have to back Emery to get the best out of the two lads coming in, which I have faith in. Juve's academy is producing good talent & Illing was a starter for half of this season & he has POTENTIAL also there's a possibility that I really hope doesn't happen that Luiz might not be able to live up to the expectations. Juve are in a different financial class to the rest of Serie A though Yep I believe City also have a sell-on percentage so it's a way to scam full value for him Juves paying 28m on top of 2 players. That would make the valuation of the 2 players only 22m if the valuation is 50m no chance. The valuation is closer to 70m. That's just the difference in the fees. Each player will have a fee attached to them, including Luiz. And the bigger the fee for Luiz, the more Villa can spend this window. >Enzo is a sideways passing defensive mid player that doesnt offer really anything going forward. Hes fine depth but thats it  I'm not really a stats guy but last season Barrenechea was 2nd for forward passes & progressive passes amongst U23 midfielders in the top 5 leagues.     He's excellent on the ball, it's his athleticism that I think could be an issue in the Prem but we'll see.  Barrenchea could turn out to be like Bentancur or Kulusevski if he ends up getting the right system & difference in wages & age is also a factor,  If were talking completely based on values this is a better deal for Juve but values won't mean much if he ends up shining over there. Holy Shit i just checked McKennie is still only 25!! Damn right Juve did good on this deal. McKennie only has one year left on his contract though, so I think we'd be lucky to even get 20m for him. Mckennie struggled in the prem last time so skepticism could be there & Barrenchea could turn out to be like Bentancur or Kulusevski if he ends up getting the right system & difference in wages & age is also a factor,  If were talking completely based on values this is a better deal for Juve but values won't mean much if he ends up shining over there. Yeah that’s the one place we will really lack in. Kamara is far more important, Luiz form dropped off the cliff once he got injured to the point we played best when he got suspended Iling was not a starter. He was in the starting 11 only 10% of the time. Iling was on the bench nonstop at the start of the season. They still don't have the 70-90m in cash we'd have asked a Prem team for though. Ornstein has confirmed the 50m and 22m valuations respectively It’s juventus so could be anything between 20m and 80m That’s more of a statement about how few good u23 6s there are tbh. Which maybe allows him to have some value, but Enzo was 11th percentile for progressive passes for midfielders. That’s not great  His ability to be a defensive anchor in the midfield is what he does well imo Naah man illing didn't start for only 10% I think I saw more of him, he was constantly rotated with Kostic. I wonder if Juve is suppressing all the values to be careful after what happened with the plusvalenza bs. Good deal regardless. >but Enzo was 11th percentile for progressive passes for midfielders    He's 55th percentile, which isn't outstanding or anything but not terrible and pretty much the same as Douglas Luiz actually.     [Think you're probably looking at progressive passes received, which is obviously going to be low as he's a DM.](https://gyazo.com/3c2676a2cc1958b87175e93e32496b10) That data is tracked, so it’s not something you get to disagree with.   Iling was in the starting 11 ~10% of the time. He also barely even played on the first half Oh I totally flipped those somehow.   Yeah, 55th percentile isn’t bad. Definitely didn’t come off as a very forward passer when watching him but I only caught maybe 20% of his games.   I stand corrected on that, he might be better on the stat line that I initially thought I can disagree if it's wrong right even if it's by 1 percent which you just did No, you said he was a starter for half the season.  He wasn’t. It was around ~10% of the season. It's not 10 it's 11 you ain't right either. Im a lot more right than you saying he was a starter for 50% of the season, and that he played most the first half.   A statement that is so wrong I question if you even watched Congratulations on being more right then I was via statistics yet the only one stat you used you got it wrong & here's your upvote & I never said anything about the him playing more in tue 1st half or 2nd half."

The massive delays from Olympiakos paid off. Shades of Emi Martinez gamesmanship I hate that stupid run up. Makes you look like a dickhead when you miss as well Worst game he's played in his career, he's been absolutely awful. His form has been so poor in the second half of the season compard to the first based on the games I've watched Easily his worst game for us imo. That is so unlike him. The whole night has just been dreadful for him. The gamesmanship from Olympiacos worked That was 3 potential penalties in 3 seconds I am literally going to [REDACTED] Lmfao insane shithousery from the Olympiacos players, probably put him off a bit That poor defender was in hell trying to clear the ball. Tbf to Luiz that was the longest delay before the pen tf, and i’m not talking about the run up what a ridiciulously shit walk up What’s with that walk-dribble kind of shit. Just run and kick it. You could see it was coming Deserves that for that shitty run up The distractions from Olympiakos worked lol These run ups are just silly, when you make it that obvious of course the keeper isn’t going to fall for it and will stay still, your odds of scoring then drop so much because you have no momentum worst night for a Doug since the first Hangover Doing the Zaza never works This is the weirdest watch I’ve had of a match for some time, it just feels like Villa are willingly tanking this He's not had a great night I hope the luck runs out in this game because this is ridiculous i can't help but like it when a player overdoes the buildup  stutters and misses What Alisha Lehman does to a mf Deserved for the stutter step bullshit Unbelievable. Absolute top draw shithousary from Olympiacos to disrupt Luiz Bro Zaza'ed that pen. What a disasterclass by him today That's shit NIce What kind of run-up is that? Stupid. He did the Zaza and got the same result That’s tuff 💯  Defender was in hell trying to clear that Bro Zaza'ed that pen. That poor defender was in hell trying to clear the ball. They will regret The delay for letting luiz take this pen was an absolute disgrace.   Ref couldnt of took the piss more than he did this game. Every single time it was about him. Seems like match fixing... the guy ruined Aston villa tonight Defender was in hell trying to clear that So long as I remember that shimmy he did after scoring against us, I'll revel in his failures Dougshit Loseiz I am convinced Emi Is not doing It for the gamesmanship, he Is just an ahole And not a single yellow for any of them lmao Insane the ref let them get away with that Thank you Neymar! Lewandowski’s worse imo   Still remember it after that miss against France that got bailed out I swear they miss more often doing those run ups as well. Why don’t managers stop them Surely it makes your legs more tired as well before shooting. > Makes you look like a dickhead   I'll never not be surprised by how much the English care about how they need to look the most regular/average way possible when doing anything. A deep fear of judgment for ever enjoying themselves and a profound preoccupation with not looking like they care too much (ironically)  No dribbling, no celebrating too much, no variation in penalty runs, never looking like you are happy or having fun because that's all lame and childish Form dropped the moment we lost Kamara Definitely been poor for the last 10 games or so. But tbh i think he is gassed. Every time we rest players against ''easier'' teams, he still always played. Although its weird how he just dropped off like this. His attitude has changed aswell. Well known he’s not as good whilst he’s with Alisha Lehman. Honestly I didn't expect him to keep up that form because he was genuinely moving like the best player in the league l, it was nuts however he's been quite poor for a while now and misses kamara. He’s basically being played out of position because we lost Kamara, who is our only actual DM. Shithousing I'd call it, lol Would be funny if they started awarding a penalty per offence in situations like that. still one more leg ;) Legendary from # 16 - he first traps with a handball, attempts to clear off his face and another handball, and then tackles the Villa player for good measure. That or he was trying as hard as possible to provoke a penalty.  Well, it was probably 100% your option, but watching this clip, especially the slow-mo part, with thinking about the second one is super funny to me. He does it every time and that's the first one I've ever seen him miss Sheesh I'd forgotten about that geezer lol 3 penalties in 3 seconds 🍿 dont we all Your comment was on 0, so I fixed it. You're right. I thought the ref was shit tbh. I thought the trip at the end of the first half was a stonewall pen, and when he finally did give Villa a pen, he let Olympiakos run amok. I'd like to see more double yellows for that sort of ""gamesmanship"" when the player carries on. Stamp it out of the game with harsh measures.  (And so much for VAR checking everything at all times.) Por qué no los dos? not sure what game you’re watching, Rodinei got a yellow for it And they took out Ollie just now with not even a foul he didn’t, he gave a yellow [Pogba, ain't it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aQas-qr13s) [Neymar's run is much shorter](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/P31nEP4KBeU) No one is near Zaza. It became a meme.    I watched that match with bunches of Italian in Germany. My friends were saying that they got a huge advantage from dragging into the PK and were definitely going to win this. However, after PK, some of my friends were cursing and pacing back and forth with depression and frustration while others were laying deadly in the sofa without a word. The most sarcastic thing was their Deutsch neighbours were celebrating loudly, waving and smiling at us from the balcony. It kinda makes you look like a dickhead because doing that “dance” makes you seem arrogant.  … and if you miss, it’s pure cringe. He just came back from a 2 match ban you would think he's more rested than anyone Kinda weird how we don’t consider these pro athletes going through burnouts just like anybody with a demanding job. He put in incredible shifts first half of the season, Villa looks like a lock for 4th place and Champs League next year. I think he’s def physically exhausted and most likely mentally tired as well. Mentally driven psychos like Ronaldo and Messi really have effed up our perception on players Do you know how many legs are left? 3 fouls in one chance, just as many saved by our GK in Instanbul, all according to keikaku Maybe it was the drink and the rose tinted glasses.   But i dont think ive ever seen a more biased peformance from a ref. Chalking off a goal for minimal contact, then not giving a stone wall pen. Then gives a pen for a handball, while not then giving a pen when their player is playing basketball, only to give the pen for a tackle identical to the one earlier in the game you didnt give.   That pen he then lets them waste time, take the piss, doesn’t just book them but books our playing for literally standing his ground. Then goes back to book him again and realises he cant because he already has.   Thats not including the fouls not being given, the bringing it back for a foul for us when were on a counter, the list goes on.   Ive seen some bad refs but that took the piss last night. Fair enough, didn't notice that. I loved his little dance after getting the yellow That'll show em! It went on for ages haha I mean, a player should never care about that yeah fans tend to forget that despite being a pro footballer you still deal with exhaustion (mental and physical) like any normal person. maybe you've got more tools you've learned to cope with than the average joe, but players aren't robots (yet) Even they had periods of poor form or exhaustion, these guys are human at the end of the day. Lmao what do you think is an appropriate punishment a fucking red tf"

Who is olympiakos’ most valuable player Logika Tbf, this team is almost certainly making the Champions League next season. Well done 😂, respect the bravery posting it today though brother  I wish these players were actually available for villa. Ramsey, emi, kamara big misses for the team. Watkins and Bailey have been playing through pretty bad injuries for close to two months now. That Team is worth more than a Team in the CL Semis. PL Players are so fucking overrated, its crazy. Ramsey 42m una If we can repost this Thursday at 10pm👍🏽 overvalued PL players I wish we could field this team on Thursday. Walked in a straight line in the PL = plus 50 million Half these players didn't even play the first leg lol. McGinn is criminally undervalued. Tbh Nicolas Gonzalez should be in there over Bailey, he has 40 mil MW according to Transfermarkt still lost to olympiacos I like the Conference League, but since it was established to give smaller clubs a chance in European football I think the top 4 leagues shouldn't get any places for it. Would be nice to see clubs from some smaller leagues win prizes.  Newsflash: Leagues with high **marketability** and popularity have more inflated **market** value on players. You literally contribute to this by fleecing PL clubs in the transfer market.  Not sure what this is trying to prove. Them having higher market value isn't supposed to mean that they are better than the players of your team. Could’ve thrown €40m Nico Gonzalez in on the left wing atleast More valuable than Inter’s team 😂 What is the issue? One season of PL TV money buys Olympiacos' entire squad, same goes for Brugges. Everyone in this sub me conveniently forgets that the competition was won by a club battling relegation in the PL last season. Oh well the Premier League really is ruining European football Transfermarkt should make a slider that lets you see their value if they weren’t in a PL team.   We all know simply being at a premier league team inflates their estimated value: it’s be interesting to see how any of these boys would be valued were they at a non-English equivalent, like Frankfurt or Marseille (or whatever the actual equivalent is, as I must admit, living in Asia has made me pay less attention so my assumption might be a decade off).  Watkins is only 28, has a contract until 2028, on a 40 G/A season, with English tax, Villa could easily say £100 million. Cash money Not really related, but how is Santiago Hezze playing for you?  I always started my careers in fifa with him being the first transfer and I was really curious about him irl I wonder which Villa player makes the cut. PL overvaluation continues to be cringe  Be able to pass a ball straight and score 2 goals in the championship, instantly 20m value lmao Wow, this goes to show how overvalued Premier League players are.   P.S. Missing my main men Jacob Ramsey and Bouba Kamara. 😢 wow, so many teams represented [deleted] For a second I thought you meant that all these players once played in the English Conference playoffs, and then went on to bigger things  well that's cut and dry Transfermarkt adjusts the prices of pl players upwards, since it measures market value and not player value. Rogers and Tielemans aren't there? We should buy them. They're better than Gravenberch. Villa fans, is Luiz linked with other clubs? I can easily see him starting for most European clubs douglas luiz doesn't deserve the price tag... quality post Pl in a nutshell Because I'd rather have those 11 take on the 38 game Premier League season than the Olympiakos players.  They beat us in a one off game- we also beat Arsenal, Man City but each of their starting 11 players are probably worth more than any of ours. Shouldn't be there imo. Either Top 4 countries shouldn't get UECL spots or there should be some kind of wage cap for participating clubs Surprised to see Moreno over Digne at LB. Personally, I would take Moreno over Digne but I wouldn't have thought the pure market value was higher. I was told by ppl in this sub, they weren't favourites lmao Gonna get downvoted but fuck it.  Just because Olympiakos have beaten Villa in a one off match doesn’t mean that Olympiakos are better or the PL is overrated.  There are many factors that go into the outcome of a single game (injuries, match schedule of either team, luck, etc.) other than the skill of the two teams.  It’s better to judge how good a team is over a longer period of games. Villa are gonna finish 4th in the PL. Olympiakos would not get close to finishing top 4 in PL, let’s be real.  Most teams in the conference league wouldn’t get close to finishing top 4 in the PL. Villa most likely are the best team in the conference league (even if they don’t win it). 2 Ex Leverkusener Wingers wasting their time/ potential in mediocre.. cuz money rules I’ll guess..shame Out of the players listed there, I'd say only Cash and maybe Ramsey (largely due to his injury woes this season) are actually overvalued based on what we'd accept for them. That isn't to say they are any better than players ""worth"" less than them, just that it'd cost a lot more for us to replace them relatively.  If anything players like Watkins, Bailey and Konsa are massively undervalued. There'd be riots if we let Watkins go for £55m or Bailey for less than we paid for him. I don't want to be mean or straight up ignorant, but can csomebody explain to me how tf Watkins is worth almost 70M?  He's 28, had a solid season and that's it. Like, I don't want to be disrespectful, but the pricetag it's that bad to me. Still dont win it Yet they get trashed by Olympiakos People are saying that PL players are overvaluated but it's more that Aston Villa financial power is also wayy superior lol Lmao, hang a banner tbf, imo the only players I think they've overvalued (relative to transfermarkt valuations) is maybe Douglas Luiz and Diaby. /r/hmmm lmao If anything I would say these players are undervalued. Villa are not selling the majority of them for the price listed realistically Get me Diaby to replace Almiron 28mil for Cash, is that dead or alive? Had to There's no way Dibu is worth only 28M His name checks out Cash rules everything around me Daniel Podence at 13 million Shows how bad the prem really is We’ll see about that. If we play defensively from the get go I think villa will be in the final tbh Why would he need bravery to post this? It's just a fact that will still be equally as true even if Villa go through ""value"" is not a quality judgement, it's a rough estimate of how much money you would need to offer villa to sell. Price doesn't necessarily equal skill. These players play in the premier league, so their prices are higher than players in other leagues, given they are on the same level of skill. Also, that price is what you would have to pay a rich premier league club to let them leave, so obviously the price level is higher again Except it isn't a rating, just a market value that we can hardly verify. [deleted] More like overpriced than overated because we talk about cost, not skill. Pretty odd logic, for one it's just a website, it's not real and you think.They should just value the Dortmund players higher cos they are in a Semi? The EPL tax is atrocious. Only dortmund. The other three are far richer. I think these stats don't tell the full picture.   It ignores all the time and effort we've spent developing these players - only Torres, Moreno and Diaby were transfers that we got in for those prices. Ramsay is home grown, Konsa was playing for us in the Championship, Kamara was a free transfer. It's not about being over rated. It's because the league is so full of money teams aren't desperate for money (unless you are Everton)  English clubs can hold out for so much more money than most other leagues clubs can.  You put these players into a random Ligue 1 team, Toulouse. Their values are halved instantly. Not really. It’s more the teams that are overrated.  You get prem flops who then start playing great in other leagues.  Like everyone thought players like Sancho and Dier were no good and yet they do very well in other leagues. You think the odds would be on dortmund winning if those two were facing each other lol? Playing FIFA is how I learned how much more premier league players get paid than players in other leagues.   You can probably make more money as a doctor than you can as an average player in a non PL league. That's one of the more reasonable ones, unless you're saying it's too low because this is in euros. Jacob is quality just had his season ruined by injury. Basic economics innit. If teams have more money, and will need to pay more to replace them, they can charge more for their best players. Makes it a stupid way of naming an XI really I’m surprised that’s everyone’s takeaway here, and not ‘look at the huge financial imbalance of having a PL team in the conference league’.  On paper, that Villa side should comfortably beat Olympiacos. The fact they didn’t doesn’t mean the players are actually all vastly overrated, given that the same side beat Arsenal 2-0 just a couple of weeks ago and is currently fourth in the league. Players in the PL are simply worth more because it’s much richer than the other leagues. That’s the whole concept of value, so saying they’re overvalued is a bit weird Why are they overvalued?  [deleted] Using some random website hardly shows much.  It would be interesting to see actual prices paid as I would expect Villa to have most of those too.  Also some of them are ott, some of them are a fine value. Transfermarket does something similar for players that join big teams. It's a measure or market value and willingness to pay, not necessarily player quality. For example, their Upamecano valuation is comical if viewed as a measure of player quality only. And we only paid £5m.   Midfield of Luiz, McGinn, Kamara and Ramsey cost us a total of £20m No English tax applied. In this case, its just because of his age. He’s 29, around 5-6 years older compared to the others in that midfield They have him in the right so he'd have to be more expensive than diaby, is his position inaccurate then Finally some respect for my boy At home It's never going to happen because the top league teams are what makes the competition more attractive and brings in money, but I would also love to have them excluded. I want an actual competition for smaller clubs. I agree with the sentiment, however I feel like it would undervalue the cup more Get your point but if Olympiakos knock us out as it’s looking on Thursday, it’s a big (ish) story. Let’s face it, if they knocked out Legia Warsaw, who outside clubs of those teams care?  The problem is that the top 4-5 leagues are from some of the most populated countries in Europe (since Russia is also excluded nowadays). Also teams like Aston Villa and Fiorentina (fans in Argentina because of Batistuta) are much more popular worldwide too.  Removing those teams means UECL is gonna lose a lot in popularity, so lose money, so it won't happen for UEFA.  *I'm not saying I agree/disagree with you, I'm just explaining the situation.* 100% agree. A European cup is a great idea, a second European cup is a fine idea, but if you're going to make a third European cup and give teams who are basically mid table a free pass to play ""In Europe"", exclude England, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France. Otherwise it's just an easy and frankly cheap title for giant clubs to win.  A one off loss by a Villa doesn't disprove anything and I think in 10 years when we look at the Conference League and which teams consistenly make it to the finals, it's going to be mostly massive teams with 150M, 200M, 300M+ squads who happened to have an off year prior and got dumped into the Conf. League when really they should be playing Champions League. I actually think having the Top 4 is good for the competition. Its usually been teams that don't see Europe very often (Fiorentina, Koln, Osasuna, Berlin), and when they get eliminated it helps legitimize the performances of clubs from ""smaller"" leagues that make deep runs. you may want to check the match thread here on Thursday, the number of comments should tell the pull of Prem team Yup, doesn't prove much. Transfermarkt does the same sort of adjustment if an average player joins a big club. His position is in as a right winger so he doesn't appear He doesn’t play there…. Nobody's buying Watkins for the same price as Kane, nobody really compared Watkins to the best striker in the world. Yes Watkins has a long contract, is younger etc. But the optics just wouldn't look good even if it makes sense economically. Actually mad that that's even a discussion on price. Bellingham and Kane just moved *this* season for ~100m. That should be what a 100m signing is. Not Ollie Watkins. But since Prem money is busted and Caicedo and Enzo recently also moved for upwards of a 100m I guess you're right lol He is great, a bargain for 4 million , probably gonna make good profit on him  Runs endlessly and is good technically, a nice change from our previous slow players in that position He has talent tho… It doesn't mean that agreed, however it does mean that the distance isn't as long as it seems So by your logic arsenal are better than Bayern because they’re top of the prem and Bayern wouldn’t be ? This is in euros btw, no chance I would accept 35 million pounds for Jacob. How dare you malign Poland legend Mateusz Caszinski! > There'd be riots if we let Watkins go for £55m  Imagine reading this statement 15 years ago. 55m is absolutely off its tits money. >If anything players like Watkins (...) are massively undervalued.  you do realise Watkins value is higher than fucking Gyokeres and Gimenez right? that´s absurd Nah nah not solid, I'd say amazing. Not many players with double digits in goals and assists If someone would offer 65M€ for Watkins right now it would be instantly rejected. He is that good.  Best ST this season in PL. Surely, those two things are not mutually exclusive. i love this lol Love your propic C.R.E.A.M. Lyrically n___as can't see me Money is the root of all evil I'm happy that he has found success with you guys even if he left us the way he did FPL cultured hero Daniel Podence?? Any insight on how El Kaabi and El Arabi are playing for you guys.  El Kaabi is a pure product of Moroccan first division so we are very proud of him. how's hezze? (we miss him a lot) Youre twirling your moustache rn getting those premheads arent ya Not gonna lie, amazing fish here Please keep talking shit I adore prem elitists getting annoyed  High quality bait for low quality fish How so? How does it? We've been great this season. We absolutely dominated Pep's City at homen a way I've never seen this City team dominated. Also 6 points against Arsenal. For the second half at the Emirates they couldn't even get out of their own half. You went off with this You say it as a joke but its true for this year. Look at Chelsea and United how god awful they were for most of the year and they are still both in contention for 6-7 place.  Arsenal got manhandled by Bayern while being absolutely dominant in the prem. As an Englishman there's gonna be a lot of people from the other side of the globe rattled by this comment. That's like saying Bayer Leverkusen is showing how bad the Bundesliga is by going from a Europa Leauge team to undefeated all season. If the prem is so bad why don’t more guys making 5k a week in their league come earn 100k a week there lol Bundesliga team fans finally have a year where they have a decent run in European competitions and now they get big-headed thinking they can shit on the top tier league in the world. How cute. Under Emery, Villa have been playing a lot better. Watkins has the second highest goal contributions in the whole of europe and Villa have some of the best defending stats out there. These aren't random players anymore, they're some of the best in the world that managed to push Villa to 4th place in the Prem.  I'd actually argue that no team in the bundesliga would survive in the Premier League. Tuchel said it himself, ""The Premier League is more robust and demands even more from the players than the Bundesliga"", not only is the timetable harsh, but premier league teams play more games on average per season. Just show you how bad the conference is , why they'll put the effort in a competition that if they win it will give them the Europa league when they are fighting at the same time for a spot in the Champions league ? The odds are heavily in thier favour. Aston Villa need 3 more points from 2 games Or for Tottenham to lose 1 game. Tottenham are yet to face Man City Spurs ain't getting the champions league bud 💀 I don’t see how you can hate from outside the club Villa basically have 4th wrapped up, there's more chance of us coming 5th (which I don't think will happen) than spurs finishing 4th Always trust in Don José Luis Mendilibar How you feeling about the next game ? As a Villa fan and after our game last night I’m not so confident we’ve got it in us to bring it back from 2-0. But stranger things have happened I dunno mate, not sure if we’re both just playing coy just in case, but our players are absolutely cooked at the moment. Your league giving you the week off will make the difference  You will go to the final. Well done in the first leg, you guys were awesome, and your fans are incredible. His team, Olympiakos, are currently beating Villa, my team, in the conference semi finals. Most would agree this was unexpected, especially given the gulf in **perceived** quality between our two sides. Him posting this is a playful joke, boast, and also a factual statement. In turn I made a joke about it being brave because if they lose, then this would make OP look a little silly.   Like an onion, the post has layers.   TLDR; it was a joke mate The only players there we'd sell at these prices are Cash, and *possibly* Luiz/Ramsey. Quite a few of them are around what we paid. It is not an estimation of villas selling price.  It is an estimation of the players market price, so how much buyers would be willing to pay for these players.  Transfermarkt is used so frequently on this sub and I still feel like the majority does not understand these values. Value is highly subjective though, especially for English players.   If Ollie Watkins had the exact same qualities but was Spanish or German, he would be worth a lot less. Simply having an English passport increases your value by 50% I wouldn't say that. Transfer value has really become kind of a judgement of how good a player is or how much potential he has. You see very rarely that a player is actually sold for his market value. Some players even have higher market values than release clauses Exactly. The Premier League is flush with cash, hence their players are “valued” higher for equivalent skill - because you’d need to offer more to entice someone who already has enough money.   Look at Aston Villa vs BVB. The latter is by all metrics more successful. Yet Aston Villa can outspend them on a whim. Villa can drop €35m on a player and it’s not even their biggest signing that year, while BVB are penny pinching to make it happen (granted they’re looking at Sancho too).  contract also matters too The main reason for Prem teams to have high MV is that Prem teams have the most money and they are far more willing to pay big sums for players that already play in the Prem than players that play in other leagues. Tell that to the Italian federation Drake aka BBL Drizzy *laughs in Taylor Swift* That doesn't make any sense here.  The reason that's the way with those people is because the metric for success under capitalism is money and the popular ones bring in more views and money.  Quality isn't the metric.  But when it comes to sports, the metric is usually about winning.  Winning is what brings in more views and more money.  It's relatively rare just to sign players because they are popular.  And that's certainly not the case with these Villa players. [deleted] Do you think the same exact players would have higher or lower market values if they played in Dortmund (who are UCL semifinalist)?  If you can think about this question you will have your answer They should value Dortmund players higher because they are better. I haven't heard of most of these players ever, yet some of them are worth 80M. Nobody really thought Sancho was bad. People know that ManU is a burning trashcan. Of course Dortmund would be winning, are you fucking delusional? > You can probably make more money as a doctor than you can as an average player in a non PL league.  What? Where are doctors paid millions per year 42 million is still a lot especially considering he just came back from a big injury. /r/soccer does not understand how supply and demand works.  i have been here for ten yearsnow, give up > Basic economics innit.  Except PL doesn’t exist in a bubble Villa fans have been complaining they have been playing loads of games and have a few injuries.   They also knocked out Lille (on pens) and Ajax easily in previous rounds. Even a good team can get disappointing results.. If it fits the story they want, one game will tell them more than the whole season. Aston Villa is officially worse than Olympiakos now and since Villa dominated Man City when they played them, it's obvious that Olympiakos would win the Premier League if they got to play it duh. Sanity. People think a team being richer means that they will always beat a less wealthy team. As if this isn't the lowest scoring game in the world where anything can happen in a single game.  Does that mean Liverpool players are overrated because they lost to Everton 2-0 who are 15th in the league? >On paper, that Villa side should comfortably beat Olympiacos. The fact they didn’t doesn’t mean the players are actually all vastly overrated  It's a single game. If you watch football it shouldn't come as a surprise that a single result can be different than what you expected. When AC Milan lost to Monza they didn't suddenly swap positions in the league table either. No, you're still in second place because you're the second best team. That doesn't become untrue because you lost to a significantly weaker team. >On paper, that Villa side should comfortably beat Olympiacos  on what paper though? the paper that they did well in the PL? that's the whole issue. Over inflating players because thy play in the PL.   When they get testet internationally they all get humbled > That’s the whole concept of value  Incorrect, this would only be true if PL was a closed market. Items and assets are misvalued all the time. If you want to talk about ""value"" as a **concept** the fact that PL clubs prefer to buy already proven PL players makes them overvalued because that's just a subjective preference moving the price away from the players **absolute** fair market value. You are confusing value with price. it's simple  if people know you have money and that you can pay more than most other teams are willing to, then they will force you  english teams are suffering from success really, simply because that the english football structure works really well. because prem elitists saw you lose to olympiacos and decided the whole villa team is shit They are overvalued because of the PL-tag. You put this team in any other big league and they finish 4th at best. And then you look at those numbers being reduced to a 3rd.  That'd be a fair evaluation, this is just inflated. Anyone that is willing to buy at these prices is just a clueless idiot. Cash isnt valued that high. Not sure who’d spend that on him. Watkins value is higher than fucking Gyokeres for example, that´s comical... Douglas Luiz is almost the double of Joao Neves value, just to give two examples Emi isn’t going for 84M. They're overvalued comparatively to ability. 28 mil for Matty Cash is mental. Kamara was worth 20 million less playing for OM, I doubt he was any worse as a player. It's just that any player in or linked to a move to the Prem has his value inflated. Martinez is 31. I don't think he's valued at nearly €90m Abso not the case tbf, we can ask for those prices but realistically nobodies paying Villa (418M) spent 26x what Olympiakos (16M) did on their registered squads. Doesn’t really say much either, if you have more money you can spend more on a player. Shhhh we paid what this picture shows He was a god to hibs fans before he left for villa but he has improved immeasurably since leaving tbh No, Diaby and Bailey are interchangeable on either side, but just looking at the stats, Diaby has played the most games in the right or being subbed into the right as a rm, or a rs. Nico G only okay right unless we’re desperate. Really only when Kouame was at Afcon and Sottil was injured. Ikone can’t play left so Nico had to go over or we played Bonaventura as a lw…which wasn’t ideal. Just move Diaby to the left and then put him on the right Meh what's the point then, moneywise?   Conf league needs more money, CHampions league less.   Club Brugge is playing in the semi finals, we've already played like 8 opponents (includering preliminaries) and still we haven't made HALF of what Antwerp earned in the Champions League, by just showing up.  That's ridiculous, game's the game of course we knew this beforehand. But when you objectively look at it, it's insane 100% , you guys smashed a prem team after people said u fluked your way through , beat Fenerbache on pens too even after it looked like you were gonna go out , amazing story and i’m sure this cup run wouldn’t be as special if you guys didn’t face these huge teams , hope you guys win Nice to see this! Thanks for your reply and good luck against Villa Well, yeah.   If you play an Aston Villa side that’s nowhere near the team listed on this post, that the players that **are** available here have played more minutes than any other team in the premier league and running on absolute fumes.   Yes. The distance is going to be closer isn’t it?  A post about Villa having a high valued team then mocking them for not being able to utilise some of these players and then the rest bring less than 50% right now because of fatigue.   Well done, can’t wait for the next post bragging about how the oremier league is a joke and Aston Villa are shit after you win comfortably against our broken side Thursday. It’s a lot tighter in this case. Not necessarily Arsenal are better, but that there is not much of a gap between the two teams.  I recon Bayern would be on around the same points we’re on.  Also the fact they won by 1 goal over two legs again points to the fact that the two teams are about as good as each other. I could see us accepting £35m for him tbf, purely due to him being an academy product and him seemingly having recurring injury issues, but I wouldn't be happy about it. Unless someone has overtook him in the last couple of games, he has the most goals + assists in Europe after Kane, all without taking a single penalty (edit: looks like this is top 5 leagues only, I believe Gyokeres actually has more G/A). He's Prem player of the season for (admittedly biased) me.  Add onto this that he just signed a brand new 5 year contract and the current state of the striker market. Lol Get the money! The **Love** of money, is.* The biggest little man,  Talking as a sporting fan? I’m mad he has, the guy can’t go 4 seconds without diving Oh was he popular in FPL El Arabi is a club legend but time sure is a bitch, this season he has been nice to have for 10-15 minutes , his ball control is incredible and he could make a change even in this age  El kaabi is having a phenomenal season and while many had a bad first opinion (including me) because he doesn't really have the aforementioned ball control , the guy can just smell goals , hat trick in Europe , goals in important greek matches etc , he has worked out excellently He's been a great player , he's not flashy but when he is not on the pitch you can tell something is missing, loads of endurance , I bet you do miss him yeah Los tiene bailando jajaja I made the comment provocative on purpose, came back 2 hours later and had like 11 replies lol why do they always get so rattled  Of course the prem probably is the most league with the most quality. If prem pundits and fans (elitists) werent so annoying for the better part of a decade in claiming their league is basically hte only thing that matters in football apart from the CL im sure no one would care that they had a terrible european season.  Fact is, the entire world was happy when england lost the Euro final in 2021 and the entire world is happy that english teams are having an awful european season. Thats not a coincidence, thats a result of utter arrogance coming back to bite them in the ass. There is no explaining this horrible season, yet they still attempt to rationalize and justify. if i was a prem fan, id jsut keep quiet lol there is no winning in responding to provocative comments like mine because any response just makes them look incredibly defensive Its fourth best team gets trashed by the fourth best team in Greece. The third gets played out of the park by the 6th in Serie A. Think he's having a jab at the prem-babies who tend to use this logic for when a Union, Stuttgart or whatever makes CL from Bundesliga.   And not having a jab at all at Villas great season :) Atleast thats how I read it he was being sarcastic… I think Not exactly going to disprove his point by saying you played well against other Prem teams haha 😂 Except Leverkusen remains good in Europa League. If they got knocked out then it would be like that. Great to see how rattled 7 comments can make you guys     Difference is, leverkusen will likely advance to the europa league final while aston villa will likely get knocked out by a greek side in the conference league 5k and living in continental Europe vs 100k and living in the UK  It's a tough call to make, you know... Dreams can't be buy cope harder 🤡 Like Serie A last year only they actually had some more humility This dude actually thinks the entire bundesliga is worse than fucking sheffield united, burnley, and luton...  This is why people are always praying on englands downfall in european competitions and international play >I'd actually argue that no team in the bundesliga would survive in the Premier League. Tuchel said it himself, ""The Premier League is more robust and demands even more from the players than the Bundesliga"", not only is the timetable harsh, but premier league teams play more games on average per season.  What a joke. Newcastle was demolished in the UCL, a group topped by Dortmund.   Bayern has had a great season in Europe, standing its ground against UCL titans Real Madrid. Leipzig was also unlucky not to advance against Real Madrid. Dortmund now has the upper hand against PSG.   What's more, the best team in the Bundesliga right now is not even playing in the UCL right now. Leverkuzen is a few steps away from winning the Treble undefeated.   Meanwhile the EPL has been a complete laughing stock in Europe this season.   Jesus, listen to yourself. The coping is crazy   Im sure westham fans, players and managers will tell you their title last season meant nothing to them. Its still a a european title it still means something  You guys cant always cope out of allegations against your league by saying ""if they tried harder they would dominate!!!!"".   Ok, why do other leagues do it then? Do they just try harder or are they better? Tottenham always play their worse before facing city, just to bring their best performance of the season to the city game  But villa definitely seems the front runner for 4th place My bad - I thought you meant *qualifying* next season - not playing in next season. They’re almost certainly qualifying this year, I agree Spurs goal difference is 9 worse than Villa's, even 2 wins and a draw against City with Villa losing both of their games might not be enough. Although given it's Burnley and Sheffield United they'd probably catch them in that scenario Knowing Villa and the injuries.   They won’t be beating Liverpool after a European night and Liverpool fully rested. So then it goes down to palace away. I don’t think Villa get more than 69 points. In reality, I see 68 points.  Spurs will beat Burnley and Sheffield United. So on them for City, which I think ends in a draw. I trust that he's not gonna play defensively indeed ,  I love the guy , I don't know what he did to get the sack there but he is genuinely a wizard for us I have seen our defence shit the bed with way worse teams so I think you have a chance, we need to kill your rhythm though so no parking the bus .I'd prefer we try and play our game , seems like more of a sure way to lock the game with one early goal, considering your defence that also looked shaky no offense Looked like it against Brighton yeah, that's not the villa that toyed with city earlier in the season , still have loads of quality though  Btw I'm sure we'd get the week off anyways but this week off is for orthodox Easter so not a league decision It’s true. I’m so immensely proud of our boys but so frustrated too. Natural. If I could I’d just end the season now. We deserve fourth and a place in the semis. I'm confident to be honest, but opening up is just asking to be cursed at when you lose haha 65m for Watkins seems like a steal You’d be nuts to ship Luiz on at that price Just to add to your point those buyers include prem teams they compete with and their big budgets as the more likely purchasers too hence the prices skewing higher than other leagues Well of course duh, the homegrown rule exists. English players are more likely to stay in England so that increases their value as well. It's an estimate, so yeah it's never right.  But if it was a measure of quality, player values wouldn't jump the second they get a transfer to a bigger club or league. Same player, different values. For EPL clubs there's also the Homegrown quota to account for. That's why English trained players got a really inflated value both irl and in Transfermarkt. Wages are a much better measure. There’s a chapter in soccernomics on this. Basically, the market that determines wages is fairly efficient. Bad players get low wages, and players on high wages that don’t deserve them get lower wages on their next contract, vice versa for good players on low wages. Transfer fees are a function of loads of other factors other than player performance. They also take the recent transfer fee for that player into account so it's a bit of both Psst I see dead people  Fuck him he's the PSG of hiphop culture P Drizzy I don’t dislike things because they’re popular, and I try not to actively dislike things in general (seems a waste of energy).  But Drake? Fuck drake. Aka fake abs Drizzy ""Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles"" Nothing wrong with Supermarket Music. Dune Part 2 was extremely popular. Are you saying it's shit? Cant believe someone in a football sub doesn't understand how value works.  If I have lots of money, I will require a lot of money to sell something that I value, because I'm less inclined to sell.  If I have little money, I won't be able to hold out for that long and will most likely sell at a lower price.  Do you think players get magically better the second they get sold to a bigger club and their value increases tenfold? Do you think the exact same house in London would have a higher or lower market value if it was located in a Greek village.  If you can think about this question you will have your answer Not one player is valued at 80m.  Also you're commenting about players you've never heard of? But you know how they should be valued and know Dortmund has better players, how does that make any sense?  I'm not saying Dortmund don't have any valuable players, just that being in a semi doesn't automatically equal a higher squad value.  Edit man I hate it when people block or delete a post, it's such odd behaviour. Saying you haven’t heard of most of these players completely invalidates your opinion here, you realise He wouldn’t have succeeded at a different prem team either imo. Not good enough defensively and offensively he’s not special enough to warrant offering so little off the ball I can't tell you who would win but I definetly feel that the odds would be on Villa to win Look at a lot of the non premier league player salaries. They are making like 10k a week or less. Thats about $480k a year. Which is actually pretty achievable as a doctor, private practice attorney or software engineer.   Surprisingly, a lot of the players who play outside of the premier league aren’t making millions per year like you think. Which was a big surprise to me as well. I think it's reasonable/ on the low side. He was our best player last season, is still young and developing, is home grown, captain of England U21s. I don't think price should really incorporate injury risk that should be in a medical, and if he's not fit to play then you don't buy him. In a world where you have mediocre English players going for 30 million, that is not a lot lol. I know this place only remembers what happened last week but in no world would I be okay with selling him for this much. To be fair, I feel like a vast vast majority of people don’t understand simple economics. It’s not as widely studied as let’s say, math, language/writing/reading, history, which are generally mandatory classes for much of the schooling years. Supply and demand == Asset always valued fairly  What an amazing revelation, I feel like my finance degree was wasted. In the future I will be simply saying, ""It's true value is X because it currently costs X"" and refer to you. The football market is international though. So supply and demand are the same for every club in every league. Just because you play in England your value doesn't increase for spanish, italien or german clubs. Yeah Im not being funnt but Villa were still probably the better side in the first half. A goal wrongfully disallowed, a pen not given, a pen missed, Dougue swining his arm like an idiot, and a hilarious deflected goal. All these are sort of unlucky and changed the result from 5-2 to 2-4. Big swings in football It's a proper case of Schrodinger's Premier League -- simultaneously so rich that they're ruining European football, but also not good enough to compete and overrated. This...but unironically. When your standard for Premier league teams is that we win 100% of the games we play in Europe then yes, 'we all get humbled'. They don’t all get humbled, people have been complaining for years that the PL’s financial dominance is distorting European competition as they buy all the best players, and they’re right.    This year is a one-off and we should be grateful for it, because at the end of the day, money usually wins.  Aston villa have been playing a lot of games. The match timetables are harsh to the point where even klopp defended Villa. I think that loss was just fatigued + a lot of injuries. How would an absolute fair market value be determined? He was being linked to Atletico Madrid for £40m  only 2 years ago Gyokeres had similar stats playing in the Championship to Watkins' stats in the Prem right now. Why is it shocking Why is that comical? Watkins has been the best striker in the prem besides Haaland this season. ""Value"" can mean both ""quality"" and ""price"", but quality is only one of many inputs determining price. Once you’ve shown you can compete in the prem your value goes up. Prem tested players are worth big bucks Worse than the apparent value which is ""just"" 6 times more So use that, rather than Market Values which are bullshit. If anything it shows the true disparity and the true amount of money Premier League clubs in particular waste. Villa spent more than I thought (not that i thought it was going to be low) but using real prices makes more sense than fake ones though. Didn't make the thing , it's preset It would be even worse without the strongest clubs.   And it’s still a European trophy, tiny find it fair if countries are excluded from winning it. Antwerp earned their CL spot by winning the league, that’s a nice reward Exactly, the weight of the opponent gives your achievements value, while it has gotten to a point where we could never knock out real city Barcelona etc level of teams, facing rich historic teams in the conference is still great, it's those Ajaxes , fiorentinas romas and villas that we like the conference for , at least in greece 100% Mendilibar sorcery Lmao they got a soft pen and Villa missed one.   Also olampikos vastly outperformed their xG.   By no means did they smash Villa. The ""2nd"" team you put out was 350 million, maybe not as expensive as the top one but still, Before the game most were quite confident you'd clear the game first leg , didn't seem quite so bothered by the injury list and the fatigue The injury issues are recent and he's been unlucky. I would question any fan who's okay with him being sold. I want that as a hat. Dolla dolla bills, y'all yes He was pretty popular for that lockdown season, along with Pedro Neto in that Wolves team. Yeah he was cheap and returned often. I owned him for a few spells. Holy fuck you lit a fire under so many people's ass ahahahahahahahaha > If prem pundits and fans (elitists) werent so annoying for the better part of a decade in claiming their league is basically hte only thing that matters in football  From the outside looking in, I genuinely never understood why this rattles people as much as it does.  Annoying fans, sure I'll give you that one, but pundits? They're simply hyping up their own league by saying 'we're the best', and that's normal enough? Of course English pundits are going to cheer for English teams and the English league. Do German pundits not hype up the Bundesliga or German teams? Do Spanish pundits not talk up La Liga or Barcelona/Real Madrid? I was so happy to see Italy beat England in England in 2021 Do you never stop to think that this might be because you're watching English-language broadcast media? Commenting on English-language social media forums? Talking about English-language pundits who are bigging up an English-language league for ratings?  You don't think Spanish pundits talk about how Barca and Real are the only two important teams in the world?  You don't think Italians big up the Milan derby or Juve? Or that Italian broadcasts spend much of their focus on Ferrari in F1 or Rossi in MotoGP?  Like I get what you're saying. But basically this comes down to people purposefully watching English-language media about things in England and then calling them arrogant when they take pride in their league, or the fact it attracts so much attention and quality players from every corner of planet earth?  Are these not things that the English can take pride in?  Must we meekly sit around in a circle and say nothing while all other nations have free license to celebrate our losses and rub it in our face at every given opportunity?  I don't wish these things on you or your country. It's you who wishes it on me and mine, and for what? I've done nothing to you and won't delight in your team losing. I'm actually rooting for Dortmund to win the CL this season -- you ever think about that? You ever think that there may be many English fans who love an underdog and are supporting your team tomorrow?  Why the chip on your shoulder? How is reaching the QFs a horrible season? The prem sends new teams to these euro comps every year. Olympiacos plays in Europe every year. This is many teams basically first time (or first in a long time) adapting to European play. The same spending gap exists between say Aston Villa and Olympicaos and Asteras Tripolis in the league. These leagues with only a handful of viable teams can exert their efforts in european play. Meanwhile Villa's sched the last few weeks has been quite tough.  I think what's really at play here is that fans are annoyed that they cannot compete with the Prem monetarily and the best talents go to england (or Bayern, Madrid, Barca). This breeds resentment, so when they fail, its a celebration. “I made a proactive comment on purpose… why do they get so rattled?”  You sound so bitter and unhinged. Get a life, man.   “The entire world is happy English teams are having a bad season”  Correction: you mean mainland Europe. Nobody in North America or Asia watches the Bundesliga. Great league, great fans, but nobody watches it.   Europe =/= World, which is helpful for you to understand if you want to grasp why the Premier League is so wealthy. The arrogant English fans for the national team is entirely fabricated. No English person actually expects us to actually win anything. We may say we're one of the favourites on paper, but that's a different issue. And I'm sure you already are aware, but are just fishing, 'it's coming home' is tongue in cheek. It's not meant to be serious. As for European football at club level, I don't care, as long as Real Madrid or PSG don't win. Out side of man city the PL's top half can be very unpredictable. We can't really talk of their being a ""big 6"" anymore cause in any given season any of the big 6, except for city, can finish outside of the top 6 [deleted] You read that from “shows how bad the Prem really is”? he's _kind of_ right... Liverpool got beaten by atalanta pretty easily, Aston villa barely got through the conference league while being in the top of the premier league. not saying they're bad, but still I'm really bad at judging on here tbh Check his comments. Man absolutely hates the English league. I don't see why lol only on Reddit Shows you what it is like for fans in other leagues when PL fans get elitist.  You don't like it, and neither do we. Whatever your opinion is, it's objectively harder to play for a premier league team. I'm all for making the premier league like the bundesliga though but money is probably stopping that If the US cared about soccer we'd dominate our athletes are unmatched actually West ham ended 14 last season ,if they were fighting for a place in the champions league they would definitely had dropped the conference league.  Literally your example is proving my point Sevilla is being run horrendously. Mendilibar was made to take the blame and sacked, when the club's situation clearly wasn't his fault. Yeah nah that’s pretty fair, I think if you come out and play like you did the other day we will really struggle. They did a really good job last game shutting us down at times  Our defence can be very shaky. Hoping for a good game nonetheless  First goal either way will be extremely important I feel Yeah, I would be too. Our team is completely shattered and will be forced to play more or less the same team that shat the bed against Brighton. Running on fumes and dreams!   Oh, not to mention the atmosphere the team will be up against. Don’t think many of ours players (maybe Martinez, Luiz, Zaniolo, but after that I’m struggling) would have seen that before For a PL side, maybe. No club outside of the PL is ever paying that. 65mil is a steal? is he going to bag 50 a season lol. 65m would be almost 6x our transfer record and we're a UEL/UCL side. Which is exactly my point, value is about a lot more than just the quality of players. Take almost any English player and you can find similar quality for half the price if you look elsewhere It's more like perceived value. Clearly it's strongly related, and it's testament to EPL overall inflated rating  I also think EPL clubs may underperform on a collective basis. They've worse performances than you could expect by their players. On the contrary, Spanish or German clubs punch above their weight. Leverkusen for example could perfectly be the 3rd team in EPL but their squad value would rank how, 12th-15th? But also if it was an estimate value you need to pay for them free agents would cost 0. It’s kind of a mix of both and doesn’t really show much tbh Has a lot of other factors I'd think, homegrown players getting less etc More like ManCity, because he's been incredibly successful. Psg ain't win shit of note. I know they're strolling in ligue 1 for years but I mean cmon. Absolutely agree. Hating is poison for the soul.... Unless it's against mfkers like Drake using their fame to lure in underage girls. Nasty guy A.K.A. PDF-File Drizzy Not like us Deadbeat, pedophile, man-hoe made music [deleted] I don't think you understood his point at all. You realise its possible for something to have a fair market value and still be overrated right?  If I gave you €650 million to buy a squad of football players right now (in theory), would you spend €646m on this Aston Villa squad or would you spend €420m on Atletico Madrids squad and have 230m left over? So based on pure footballing ability, are the Aston Villa players overrated or not?   Being ""PL-proven"" adds a hefty price tag to players which is not reflected in their ability. Yes, I understand where this increase in market value comes from, that doesn't mean that the players can't still be overrated.   >Cant believe someone in a football sub doesn't understand how value works.  Your example describes ""perceived value"" and is not quite the same. The market value used in the post aims to give a more objective assessment. The numbers you see have nothing to do with Aston Villas willingness to let go of these players they are based on the extreme influx of cash in the PL. Bellingham's market value almost doubled in a half season by going from Dortmund to Real Madrid. Also Dortmund has way more money than Villa, you are just inflating prices to keep those players in the PL it's not a fucking economical PhD work Bundesliga villager league Really funny when people are convinced that Aston Villa is the house in London in this analogy when in reality they are the greek village compared to a team like Dortmund Lower  No wait, higher [deleted] Yeah Dier is really bad and only playing well, because hes in the worst League in Europe. Thats why theres 2 german Teams in the CL Semis while the only PL Team left in european competition is playing in the conference League. That’s not really true, average player salaries in Bundesliga, Ligue 1, La Liga and Serie A are way higher than that and much, much more than a typical doctor would make. I think there’s only one country in the world where $480K is ‘pretty achievable’ for doctors Pretty sure doctors only make that much in the US. bro, 480k as a doctor is not achievable anywhere in the world other than the US, and even there it’s still more than average for doctors. What the actual fuck are you on? You’re comparing average players to high end doctors, average doctors aren’t making that much even in the US.   Also $10,000 a week is $520,000 a year, not $480,000. It’s crazy how many ppl take weekly x 4 weeks x 12 months to get an annual number. You leave out an entire month, and so many people do this when stating income. Yeah, 40m seems very low. But TM's metric is a bit odd. Not specifically rSoccer related but the number of people who don't grasp the difference between gross profit and net profit pains me. And the worst evil they are doing is the transfer fees. You know, giving these ""obscenely too high"" amounts of money to OTHER non-English clubs that spend money way better, and not selling their awful, overrated players to other non-English teams... Somehow that is very evil and hurts the football, that these good non-English teams receive too high transfer fees and don't spend too high fees on bad players.   I seriously don't know why they even care if what they say is true. If someone wanted to waste ""too much"" money on exactly me, I don't think I'd object. If someone was offering me 10x the worth for every item I put on Ebay, I don't really see why they'd be hostile to me. classic excuses If I had an answer with good accuracy I would be managing transfers for a big UCL club not arguing in Reddit comments. What do you expect me to say? 2 years is a long time ago in football The best example is neves like he said. No way does Luiz go for more than neves sure, and Gyokeres has been the best striker in europe besides Kane this season, see the difference? > Prem tested players are worth big bucks.   Indeed, even the really shit ones. > we could never knock out real city Barcelona etc  No balls no glory. Hype yourself enough and anything's possible. A soft pen? I mean yeah the casual fan of course is going to be confident because there’s less of an understanding of how stuff like form and fatigue works. A lot of the more understanding fans have been concerned since the Lille games. You can just visually see the players on the pitch are laboured.   Weve literally had to sacrifice trying to win games this season in order to manage the injuries and fatigue in our squad, we rested all our star players against Man City of all teams and gave them the win.  A lot of outside fans don’t see the issues we’ve been having with this sort of thing honestly all season, because yes a lot of other teams have had a lot of injuries too. But the difference is our squad is smaller, we’ve been playing way more minutes. So the players that are available for us are just never fresh and at 100%. Emery has been working absolute miracles this second half of the season to keep our noses inside the top 4 amongst all our issues.  I’m super proud of the lads for staying strong despite everything. So seeing posts like this literally mocking us for having a bad 90 minutes against a team that’s obviously not as good as us, hurts. Transfermarkt doesn’t rate Byzantine players 😔 Yeah I remember there were some issues there, no other way a player like Podence was gonna come to us though so we feel blessed I thought you were talking as a wolves fan which would have not been exactly your flair, but strongly correlated with Because it often crosses the line from hyping up their own league into downplaying other leagues or even acting as if they do not exist. It's a combination. The EPL has so much more money than everyone else that no one can compete. The fact Premier League fans then go to brag about their league and overrate their league makes fans from other countries dislike them, because it feels as though the leagues succes has been artificially built. When the EPL with all their money fails, people celebrate, because they would rather see an organic club winning stuff No, it’s the supremely arrogant attitude of many (but not all) prem fans.  If the PL had done well in Europe this year we would have to hear about how Brighton would finish in the top 4 of the Serie A and Spurs would win Bundesliga for another year. Obviously people will gloat when these narratives lose steam because it really is torture to hear some of these brain dead opinions constantly. Olympiacos has been playing our important matches in Europe while in the playoffs, really only playing with other title contenders quite equal with us After that Dortmund person's response, you should just have not said anything. Thank you for your sensibleness. The prem is so competitive they're sending new teams regularly. It's not the same 4 in UCL or the same ConL teams every year. So while they do have more money they're often inexperienced so it balances out a bit. And these new teams have to balance their new European campaign with trying to do well in the league as well. Look at arsenal vs Bayern. Arsenal's first UCL season in 7yrs and they had to play 4th place between the two Bayern legs. They basically lost the UCL and the premier league right there.   I remember the late 2000s. It was the same 4 making CL for England every year. Lo and behold, the four teams became strong and very experienced. They dominated Europe for half a decade. We get every Bundesliga game on FoxSports and Espn+ in the US  I find myself switching to watch it as opposed to a United or Chelsea game just because it's genuinely more entertaining >We can't really talk of their being a ""big 6"" anymore cause in any given season any of the big 6, except for city, can finish outside of the top 6  You could say the same about the Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and dozens of other leagues (Uruguay included). There isn't a ""top 6"" in England, there is a ""top 2"" (Liverpool / Manchester City), or ""top 3"" in the last two seasons. You can say that for other leagues too lol, if you want to use that logic then you also have to consider other leagues. > does anyone really consider La Liga to be the best?  Yeah, plenty of people do Yes, most people consider either LaLiga or Serie A to be the best league in history, which is shown by the fact their teams have performed so well in Europe Yes becaus there where a couple of words before that specific qoute that set up the whole thing up. people were saying the same stuff about West Ham last year. what The EPL is better than the Bundesliga currently, but it's much closer than you are making it look like. If you think that Bayern, Leverkuzen, Dortmund, Leipzig or Stuttgart would struggle in the Premiership then you are clueless, simple as that. They would easily be top 6 contenders at a minimum. Feel bad for him , although that led him to us I don't know if I can take a half of being 1 goal up and trying to not get scored on, that's why I fear an early goal (we are extremely prone to conceding those)   Yeah hope for a good game and good luck in the prem, not that you need it at this point Watkins has one of the highest goal contributions in the whole of Europe, highest in the Prem, what do you mean lmao They get gifted £80m each season from Sky Sports to spend on players so Arsenal could buy him and still have £15m left to spend, just from their TV money. This just isn’t true. We’ve seen loads of bang average strikers go for mental money. Kolo Muani scored 15 goals in the bundesliga and got a 90m move out of it. And with all due respect to the Bundesliga, Werner was scoring bucketloads there. Undav, who looked terrible last year for Brighton, has almost 20 goals there.   Ramos the same, 65m and he’s been poor. Ligue un Yeah that’s actually the better comparision lol ""If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested""  Yea man, that definitely checks out. Not like Epstein and Weinstein and shit exist and prove that being famous actually makes it even easier for you to get away with it for decades.  Let's also not forget the mfer pulled up a girl on stage, asked her how old she was, she says 17 and he goes ""why you look like that"" and gives her a kiss. Aka deadbeat father Drizzy I hope for your sake that you're trolling because my god what do you reccomend? Seriously what a borefest that was. Dune 2. >You realise it's possible for something to have a fair market value and still be overrated right?  He's literally questioning the market value. Why else would he ask what their market value would be if they played in Dortmund?  >The market value used in the post aims to give a more objective assessment  So then why do players market value increase just by joining a different club? Hugo Larsson was worth €9m according to transfermarkt, and was bought for that sum, from Malmö FF to Eintracht Frankfurt. Then his value increased to 17m overnight. How do you make sense of that? https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/n73SKXjvOG  You still think that was his point? His value increased by showing that he could perform incredibly well at possibly the best club in the world? No shit. What point are you trying to make?  ""You are just inflating those prices to keep those players in the PL"". Haha what? Who is inflating the prices? And how? If you mean the clubs are inflating the prices, you're just proving that you still don't understand how the market works. The selling club decides the price. If Aston Villa don't want or need to sell, they won't sell.   ""You're overvaluing your players!"", no, they decide what the players are worth to them. That's how it works They're closer to the house in London though, both literally and figuratively - they generally offer better wages and play in a market that's probably helps more with the brand exposure, and they're no longer a shithouse rundown London flat like they might have been back in the 2010s. Of course, just as there are reasons why someone might prefer the Greek village over London, there are reasons why players go to Dortmund instead of an English club.  Plus, you know, Villa have won as many European Cups as Dortmund has, so it's not like a matter of historical prestige here. Well both dortmund and villa has the same number of ""champions league"" trophy We're factually not are we though? 4th in the Prem vs 5th in the Bundesliga. Probably both going to be in the CL next season. Both very rich clubs with big fanbases. It's just your bias doesn't want that to be the case. It makes perfect sense..  Clubs have money. Not all clubs are equal. Even the exact same player would be valued different by clubs with different financial means.     How can you not understand that? No, seriously, how can you be *that dumb*, **that financially illiterate**?     Do you genuinely think a club that spends €55m on a player has the same financial pressure as a club worth around €100m? Aston Villa spent enough just this year to have literally bought Olympiacos outright..    If you offer a random person $100m for their kidney, 99/100 would snap that offer up in seconds. Bill Gates would pay you $109m to piss off.  Did I say that? No.  Dier was rated badly in the Premier League.   Now he’s rated highly.  Those are two things I presume we agree on because they are pretty obvious.  This is an example that prem players aren’t overrated but that the teams aren’t using these great players in the best way. Be that down to managers, fans, style of play, whatever. I imagine that’s the case for the highest quarter of OECD countries. Definitely more than 1. When is gross profit ever mentioned in this sub? Gross profit is just revenue - cost of goods, manufacturing and other expenses not counted. They only use net profit when it comes to players in football. On average Premier League teams play more games without breaks than the bundesliga per season, players are more prone to fatigue and injuries. The same thing happened to West Ham last season, they started crumbling towards the end of the season because of match exhaustion. Not every team has the same luxury as the bundesliga I don’t think he’s gotten worse since then though. He’s just kinda stagnated. I don’t think his value would’ve fallen that much in 2 years that no one would even pay 28m euros for him.  He’s a decent right back at the premier league level still early in his prime at the end of the day. £15-25m is about the going rate for that kind of player. Like who? we going for the champions league final next year He was part of the group of players that canceled their contract after the tragic attack on our academy. Though to be fair he was getting less and less time for us so a move during that off season was inevitable haha fair >When the EPL with all their money fails, people celebrate, because they would rather see an organic club winning stuff  sorta like Bayer this year, right? Bundesliga also celebrates when a non-bayern team wins too. How does that make you feel?  > overrate their league   This is the part that confuses me. We all have access to the UEFA Coefficients. EPL is significantly higher than other leagues. Its not just who is at the top, but the quality top down. I'm sure there is an identical thread to this made last year when West Ham lost the first leg in the Semis(?) and then went on to win it all.   The way knockout competitions give ""lesser"" teams on paper the chance to compete. do you often look at the spending difference between yourself and the other 80% of your league? I know there's a prem hate circle jerk, I don't care I'll still state my opinion. England dominated Europe so much that they had an insurmountable four title winners in 20 years🔥 If the balance of the league is your argument that makes the PL the big league, I present to you the Brasileirão. that in addition to the balance, the unpredictability of the winner, rotation of decades between teams, there are the greatest talents, who are only in England because of the money. But that isn't unique to the Premier League. Since the creation of the Conference League there have been 5 different English clubs to make European semi-finals, the same amount as Germany and less than Italy. Those league are also sending multiple teams deep in Europe often without much continental experience and still seeing a fairly similar amount of success over that 3 year span.   The myth that the English midtable is miles stronger than the Bundesliga's or Serie A's is just not holding up to what we're seeing in competitions. Keep in mind what makes the prem so great is the parity in the league. The top 10 teams are quite competitive and even the top teams struggle those in the bottom half. This is what also makes it hard for prem teams to compete in Europe. The top 2-4 teams from each of the top 5 leagues and the top team from lesser European leagues are actually pretty close in quality. That said, in the prem the quality of their league competition week in week out is much higher on weekends than their competitors throughout Europe. On the weekend they play more difficult teams than their European counterparts, then play the top European teams mid week. Add in other cup games and some teams play 10 games in a month, all against tough competition. It’s a more difficult schedule that makes it difficult for English teams to compete in Europe. You have to choose to prioritize league or European play but since the parity is so great, prioritizing European play really risks your chance of making it back to Europe next year. USA gets it good for bundesliga. Germans have to deal with DAZN and SKY and other shit. They have specific games split up on different networks. Hard to complain about 1 ESPN+ membership Dude you need to be real here, Americans care about the Premier League and Real/Barca. Sure some might watch German football but it's a very small number by comparison. All the bars that show soccer do premier league mornings, none do Bundesliga mornings. I'm not disrespecting German football, I love it and I've seen Shalke play and it was fantastic -- but I think you're just not painting a realistic picture here lol, what? Feels like I’m walking into a room where there’s just been a really toxic argument. If he’s being sarcastic I’m too dumb to not need /s Were they? West Ham looked really good throughout the Conference League last year while being incredibly mediocre in the Prem. Outside of the Final I dont remember a time they were in danger of being eliminated, while Villa have had to go to penalties already and are in a really bad spot right now. There are millions of French, Spanish, German. Greeks living in the UK out of choice. Yeah I get that tension will be high regardless haha   Thanks hopefully we don’t! Goodluck to you guys He's 28 years old 15-goal striker who's having a season way above his average. Nobody outside of the PL is spending 65 million for him unless they are desperate. ok farmer Dortmund for example is not doubbeling their record transfer fee for him lmao what on earth are you on about.   Outside of Bayern no club in germany could even dream about signing him. And then he is not nearly the player to justify potentionally bankrupting your club for.   And this is the same in all the other leagues too. You really think a french club besides PSG is paying 65m for a Player? Yep. I know I sound like I'm just whining but it's so crazy to me, we spend 15m on our player of the season and it's just good value, they spend 15m and if the player appears 4x it's good value. It's a totally different sport. He's been quite good lately, could've just been him adapting early on. P Drizzy slow in his head. Diddy prime example for this and this mfer out here saying ""I'm way too famous for this shit"" Hey, better for a PDF-File to be a deadbeat father :)) The original comment said that the players were overrated not overvalued, which is different.   But still: Yes, Hugo Larssons absolute market value was probably closer €17m all along but it's harder to value players playing in small leagues like Allsvenskan. Frankfurt exploited that discrepancy and pretty much got €8m for free. The ""value"" represented isn't being set by some omnipotent being. It is very hard to value a player that half of europe doesn't even know exists.   https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp Try applying this concept to another item or asset (in this case football players) and you will see my point. There's not a single market in the world that's automatically perfectly efficient. Especially not the football player market. Players are mispriced based on subjective preferences and external factors all the time.    My gripe isn't necessarily with this post in particular just the argument that a player can't be overvalued because ""someone is willing to pay the price"". This has nothing to do with the absolute objective value of the player, only his market price. I guess it depends what you consider ‘pretty achievable’.  It’s definitely possible in more than one country, but is it something a good doctor can expect to earn with normal career progression? Premier League teams also have bigger teams while not having a dedicated second team  just a bunch of Premier League myths Yeah that's only around £24m and to be honest that's a decently good price for a player in the prime of his career, is home grown and has proven that he's good enough for a top 6/8 Premier League team.  Not a bargin by any means but not a bad price either Like Robin Olsen or Troost Ekong both of whom I've got first hand experience with. We've paid one million for the former Watford centerback only for him to lose his starting position to an out of postition Tomasz Kedziora we got on loan from Dynamo Kyiv. See you there Ah bad stuff , I thought it was more something to do with money It's not like Bayern at all. Bayern is a completely organic club, owned by fans. Bayern however has grown so dominant over German football, that most German fans want another team to break our dominance, as a more competitive league would be a healthier league. Other fans don't generally dislike us (maybe a little, but not for the reason they dislike Leipzig or Hoffenheim, or the EPL teams for that matter), they just don't want us to win over and over again.   As to Premier League fans overrating their league, it's not a problem thinking you're the #1 league, because you are. It's the fact EPL fans act like other leagues don't exist and don't matter that's annoying. You disrespecting players from other leagues and saying you will batter teams when you are basing that on nothing (like all the Arsenal and other EPL fans before their game against us) is what makes the rest of the football fans celebrate your losses. You are the best league in the world, but you aren't miles clear if every other league. You could do with a little more humbleness Colour me surprised, the greek league is severely dysfunctional   80% of the greek league has 500 fans also England has 15 titles between 6 teams. Lets not even get to those that have made the final. An English team made the final every year for 5 years 2005-2009. In 2008, 3 of the 4 semifinalists were English. It was similar for many of the other years. England's coefficient in 2008/9/10/11 put them in first. Yes the gap between England and the rest wasn't as large as today (England weren't as great in EL) but they were definitely dominant in the CL. not worth taking this angle, they don't get it. Meanwhile the ""worst"" Bayern team in decades will very easily make CL next season. Arguably my best soccer related streaming purchase apart from Paramount+ so i can watch champions league at work I can't help but tell you you're wrong.   Growing up, we got MAYBE 1 EPL game a weekend- we always had Budesliga and later La Liga available, could sit and watch those games for hours in high school.   Sure, for the the casual tiktok fan probably only watches EPL and Barca/Real- but personally i have a spoil of choices and take advantage and have friends who do the same. My work TEAMs is lit lol that was his point aswell. When you make more money in the UK exponentially, ofc you go for it.  there are also British people living by choice in other countries. Not sure what that’s supposed to mean that was his point aswell. When you make more money in the UK exponentially, ofc you go for it.  there are also British people living by choice in other countries. Not sure what that’s supposed to mean No fucking way he’s 28 I thought he was like 22 and was a prodigy 19 goals and 12 assists, and that's just the premier league stats. He's in his prime Is that Barcelona’s music that I hear? By the spotless football logic , you farmed us and we farmed 2 pl teams so Freiburg>Villa ok farmers league fan The prem is absurd at this point in comparison to the average team on the continent. Most of these ""values"" are based on how much they would cost for another prem team, because no way is anyone else buying them at that cost but they're also not going for much less to a league rival. I didn't reply to the original comment.   Frankfurt don't exploit a discrepancy in transfermarkt values. They exploit a discrepancy in club economy. Do you think it's just a coincidence that players from smaller leagues NEVER go for big sums? Fair that every player in small leagues can't be properly valued by a site like transfermarkt...but why is it that every single player bought form a small league goes for a much smaller cost than what their value then shoots up to instantly after being bought?  Of course the transfermarkt values are subjective. What makes you think I disagree with that? For a specialised doctor working in the private sector, yes. That's not true, Man City have mastered team rotations to counter player fatigue but they can only do that because they have an insane budget.  Whatever your opinion is, it's objectively harder to play in the premier league. Neither of those players fit the description of being prem tested so I don’t really think you’ve got a point Troost Ekong played 17 games for a dreadful Watford team that got like 20 points. Olsen is a back up goalie and Villas first choice is a world cup winning starting goalie. Neither is Premier League proven and in Troost Ekongs case he was proven to be not good enough. I'll concede on the Bayern point until another BuLi fan can chime in.   >(like all the Arsenal and other EPL fans before their game against us  what were they saying? not sure what that changes. It's just sort of rich that probably the richest team in your league is also making a point about a spending gap lol Okay but that wasn’t his argument. His statement was, and I quote, “they dominated Europe for half a decade”. If he is referring to 2005-2010, that’s hardly dominating Europe as there were only two different title winners in that span, which both Italy and Spain achieved in that same time span. If we look at the second decade of the century, there’s still only 2 winners, the same amount that Spain and Germany had. I'm pretty sure a bigger consolidation is coming and it's going to be all into AppleTV but hopefully we dont lose convenience. Dude I'm talking about real life -- I'm talking about what matches the bars are showing, it's always premier league games, never Bundesliga  I'm not talking about some random high school. Granted, I'm in LA, so I don't know where you live maybe they love German football -- but around here it's the PL matches that are advertised Same tbh, the way I've heard some people talk about him lol in his 4 seasons in the Prem he’s scored 14, 11, 15, and 19 goals respectively for an average of ~15. Assists are 5, 2, 6, and now 12 which averages to 6.25. Outside of PL Real/Barca/Bayern/PSG are the only clubs that could spend $65 millions on a 28 y/o striker with that output, and he has only done it for one season, they definitely would rather buy a younger striker or one with better output. Other elite clubs like Atletico/Dortmund/Juve/Milan/Inter can't afford to take such a risk and neither can lower clubs. see y'all in the cl/el finals. oh nevermind... I am talking about fair market value. Not transfermarkt value. You said it yourself, big clubs can buy these players below a fair market value. You are literally describing my point then arguing against me. They bought a player for 9m who should have been valued much higher. But they can do it because of external circumstances (small league with low funds) well I’ll have to take your word for it, because I can’t find anything else to back that up They've both played full PL seasons. But no, you're right I don't have a point. Carry on considering the prices and valuations of Premier League players are fairly reasonable. My point all along is that even the shit players in the league are worth too much. You proving that they are in fact shit isn't news to me. Before the match against Porto there were lots of Arsenal fans talking shit about winning 5 or 6-0, only to lose 1-0 and eventually only get through on penalties. Most Premier League fans and Arsenal fans here on reddit, on twitter and on tiktok were expecting Arsenal to win at least 3-0 at the emirates, I've seen so many people say they would take revenge for 10-2 and stuff like that. I can't be bothered to dig through old posts to find examples for you because you'll just say that it's only a couple people that said that or something, but if you were on this sub or on r/gunners before the game you'd think Arsenal were playing Huddersfield Town You can scale it back as much as you want, there's always a richer team, the issue at hand is one of leagues, Luton town could outspend us just by being in england Is real life viewing of soccer only in bars?  We're a bunch of guys in NY, in their 20s and 30s at work and have pools where we pick the top 4 of the the top 5 leagues.  I can't relate to such a narrow view of us fans lol Those first 3 seasons he was playing in a side usually in mid table or lower. They were fighting relegation 15 months ago. So those are really good goal numbers for that. Now the team has gotten better, and he’s coming into his prime he’s getting a lot more contributions. I don't get it, those are great stats for a striker? > and he has only done it for one season  Hes got 10+ goals for what, 3 or 4 seasons now. In a mid table Vila side. Obviously the market prices are inflated but EPL proven strikers are hard to come by Freiberg is in the CL? How does fair market value get valued?  So you agree that transfermarkt value takes club funds into account. And my original point was that a player for Aston Villa is obviously gonna be valued higher by transfermarkt than a player for a club or league with lower funds.  And mate, you're the one who started arguing against me. If you agree with my point, why are you arguing against ME? The point I’m making is the price of a player once he’s played in the prem and then moves to another prem is inflated for being prem proven. You don’t even understand the point, you’re just too caught up in prem hate You should be annoyed at your club for signing bad players not transfermarkt and their made up bad valuations. Shit players are worth more in the highest standard league in the world are worth more than shit players in the Greek league. Having said that every player here is really good and one game doesn't disprove that. Surely you'd swap and England and Spain internationals for your CBs? Also Giannoulis and Tzolis were shit for Norwich in the Premier League but still worth 8 to 10 million to us are they overvalued and shit?  Maybe those Twitter troll accounts with player avis, but I haven't heard any of this myself. I never really understood this take. There are hundreds of thousands of Arsenal fans online that span continents. Somehow there's a singular thought that we had? C'mon be realistic. I think fans like you are a bit too sensitive. So what if some arsenal fans are a bit over the top and felt like they were a better team this time around.  The fact of the matter is the opnions were all over the place. Luton town cannot outspend Olympiacos lol they need at least 2 more years in the prem to do that The conversation is more in contention on whether those stats justify the hypothetical €65M price tag Ok, then I will rephrase my argument to make it clear.  > If I have lots of money, I will require a lot of money to sell something that I value, because I'm less inclined to sell. >  > If I have little money, I won't be able to hold out for that long and will most likely sell at a lower price.   This is not ""value"". Mate I didn't even disagree with you up until you told me players that have played full seasons in the Prem don't fit the description of PL tested. My point is any player in or associated with the Prem has his value inflated otherwise clubs wouldn't ask 100mil for Antony and Mudryk. What made you conclude I blamed transfermarkt valuations ? I brought up players I can safely pass judgement on having watched them over the course of at least thirty games. Swapping Mavropanos for Maguire is reasonable so long as I'm not asked to pay 80 mil for the latter. Being better or best doesn't have to justify exorbitant valuations.   Tzolis wasn't ready to make a move and I said so at the time. Giannoulis was amazing offensively playing with 3atb, has notable weaknesses more evident playing as a full-back, Atalanta had shown interest at the time and I think would have been a far better move for him. [It's in Portuguese but you can use a translator](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrimeiraLiga/s/NbAauKyThR). Arsenal fans, in the city of Porto, talking about 5 and 6-0 before the match. A match they lost 1-0. The comments on that thread also mention r/gunners being full of themselves.  EDIT: The article has actual video interviewing a fan so you can just listen to it and ignore the subtitles. The fact is fans from other leagues see EPL fans as more arrogant over the board because of things like that, and that is why we are happy when smaller teams like Olympiacos beat a rich team with a louder fanbase like Villa Yeah they’re prem tested now but they haven’t been sold since so therefore it hasn’t yet affected their price in a transfer. Re Anthony and mudryk, a fool and their gold are easily parted but they were both seen as the prime talents of their respective windows. The highest price gets the player This is pretty silly. It’s an article about a video interview where two random fans say Arsenal will smash it 5-0, but others right there are saying it’s going to be a tough game. Lol, it’s just like people seeing a headline and totally running with it. It worked though, people like you who are waiting for the favorites to be a bit arrogant caught wind to the headline and ran with it. its odd coming from a Bayern fan of all teams though ""We'll probably win like 5 or 6-0, the Porto team is alright but nothing compared to Arsenal.""  ""My expectation for tonight is we're gonna win 5-0. [...] The Arsenal are the best team in the world.""  ""Arsenal is going to win, sorry, sorry for the Porto team but Arsenal is going to be [something I can't understand but a synonym for amazing].""  ""We're gonna win 4-1, don't worry about Porto.""  These are direct quotes from the video. Do you want me to pull the r/gunners pre-match thread as well? Because I was reading that too just before the match and the sentiment was the same. Some were telling people to be cautious and that Porto would be tricky but the majority was just spouting the 5-0 crap. Why? BuLi doesn't have close to the amount of money as EPL, and as a result is less dominant in Europe. Also we are an organic club, not an artificial one Why did you pull these quotes specifically when there are also quotes from others saying it will be close with much closer ties...? lol look, you fell for it and are too ashamed to admit it. You linked a video you didn't watch (the video was in English so I didn't need a translator). I'm sure you can find folks saying 5-0 and I'm also sure you can find a sizeable amount of folks saying it will be tough. That's what happens when you have such a wide-ranging fanbase.   That video isn't indicative of shit either way. It's interviewing drunk fans hype before a game. You think interviewing Porto fans would be less confident? It's like those videos where people interview folks at a political rally. They're only going to post the ones that give the strongest reactions. Bayern is essentially the sole club in the wealthiest German region. They spend as much on wages as City does. They are grossly disproportionate and constantly usurp the best talent in the league. While Bayern may not have the sheikhs or foreign investors, that might be the only way to shake up Bayerns dominance. I fell... for what exactly? Lol. I linked a thread, in Portuguese, that itself links to an article, in Portuguese, so yeah, you could use a translator to read what's being said there. Sure I didn't watch the video 2 months ago, I have more important stuff to do, I only read the thread, but I watched it now for the quotes and it's 4 quotes for the ""Arsenal will win 5-0"" side and only 2 for the ""Porto will be tough"" side. But fine, some quotes from the pre-match thread as well:  ""If we can get a clean sheet and a win here, we slaughter them at home.""  ""I'll take a 6-0 aggregate score."" (later in the same comment chain) ""A 4-1 or 5-1 aggregate win would be fairly realistic [...] We're a force to reckon with and I'm fairly confident it'll show against Porto and teams that come about.""  ""Bollocks to the Europe pedigree, European crowds, Porto are a good side excuses, we are the Arsenal. 0-4 to us""  ""Porto 1-3 Arsenal"" (this one is not as bad but nothing was said about Porto being good, just talking about the away goals not being a thing and how that would make Porto lose at home)  ""I am quite comfortable going into this. [...] Porto is not that threatening.""  ""Predicting 6-0 win""  ""I predict a statement win. At least 3 goals for""  ""On our current form I'm confident we can pump Porto home and away. If anyone replies saying 'cl is different' I am telling them to do one""  ""We're gonna body Porto""   ""I'm pumped for this win""  ""Their goalie asked to get spanked hard so I hope we deliver. Be careful what you wish for. 4-0 to the Arsenal""  Is that enough? You feel for the anti-PL circle jerk. A Portuguese article will obviously highlight ridiculous takes lol they're not trying to be objective. You asked me to look at the video not the thread, just stop.  You might have more pressing things to do, but you still went through the pre-match thread to pull quotes? okay sure. It seems like you’re trying to craft a bit of a silly narrative.   You know I can also look up the comments too...right? https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1avf14v/prematch_thread_fc_porto_vs_arsenal_21st_february/  Tell me, do these really reflect the story you're trying to tell? There’s a real mix of over-the-top confidence, obvious trolling—like the comment saying it’ll be a tight game, 8-0 to the good guys—and worry. The mood is all over the place. >Maybe those Twitter troll accounts with player avis, but I haven't heard any of this myself   \[...\]  >The mood is all over the place.  So is it those Twitter troll accounts or is it a significant portion of the Arsenal fanbase? And it's not really *that* over the place. Ignore the comments of people excited about a UCL knockout match and I'd say most of the comments talk about a comfortable win. There are a few people being cautious as well, of course, not everyone is the obnoxious type I'm criticising here, but I quoted 11 comments (not even quoting the ""8-0 to the good guys"" obvious trolling) from there and I can find 7 (being generous) cautious comments up to the last one I quoted. But don't take my word for it, take the word of someone in the thread itself:  >Listen lads. Everyone is very confident on this thread. But let’s not forget this is the UCL and we’re away. Things happen. I do expect us to progress through to the next round but let’s not be too cocky and say we’ll cook Porto tonight 5-0. You're proving exactly what I'm saying. There is a wide-ranging set of opinions from arsenal fans. What isn't real is the narrative that there was an overwhelming majority of fans claiming they'd stomp over porto. You got caught into the circle jerk and didn't check your sources. It's fine. It's happened to everyone at least once before."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* I’ll be relieved that this one is over. I’ll miss Dougie but, of all of our top players, he was probably the most replaceable over say Martinez, Watkins etc. It sounds like we’re getting some good potential in as well so I’ll take it. Swap deal done, this sub is gonna melt I have no real opinion because I know nothing really of the two players we are getting and I won't pretend to try and form an opinion from looking at transfermarket or youtube highlights.  Just hope Luiz smashes it. Been a committed and consistent player for us since we returned to the Premier League. One of the most important players of the last 5 years. Wish we could have kept him but of the key players he is probably the ""easiest"" to replace Goodbye Dougie and good luck in Turin. One of my favourite players to wear the Villa shirt. Bet they won't complain about ""fair market value"" for this one, we are getting short changed here and it's sad to see Dougie go but unfortunately it has to be this way, he also apparently wouldn't sign a new contract so I guess he had this in his mind. Bye my sweet Brazilian prince. Todd Boehly must be FUMING a swap deal has been done without him The kind of deal people said is unrealistic. 2 players for 1 swap.  Seems like swaps would be counter productive for PSR?  Why not sell for €50m and buy the other two players.    *I’m not aware of the two Juve players and what their value is. I thought it was £50m plus £22m with the two players? Is it too late to chuck in McKennie for free? we get it , this deal is happening. stop posting it Have Villa been linked with any more DM’s?  Outside of McKennie, I haven’t seen links to any others. Isn’t the swap deal against Villa’s interest here?  Like they’ll only get £28m fee in for PSR calc but Luiz is worth much more than that juve drama will also be incoming. 100% will be another battle in the courts. There is a severe severe lack of sky 6 flairs crying faux inflation in here. Shocking really Under PSR rules it essentially works out the same either way, if the value of the players + cash adds up to £60m.  The bonus of doing it this way is, with Villa for example, if Man City have a sell-on clause on Luiz (let say 10%), Villa would only need to pay 10% of the cash amount (so £2.8m instead of £6m). That is exactly what happened…. The buy and sell happens anyway, will be monitored by FIFA in order to make sure the transfer money is all calculated correctly and the players' previous clubs are all compensated.  One such example of clubs trying to get around compensating previous clubs was the Ibra-Eto'o swap, they tried to convince Fifa that Eto'o on one year was worth 20m or so, which was a joke of course. Zlatan for 70 or 80 was cheap as well. Correct He’d want £200k a week, the number 10 shirt, to be made captain, to be the penalty taker, the free kick taker, the corner taker and have the statue of William McGregor outside the Trinity Road stand replaced with one of him. Im so glad we dodged that nuclear bomb, id rather take a punt on some more unknown younger players with high potential than take in a clown like McKennie. Barkley is apparently a done deal. I know, not your typical DM, but that's the position he mostly played for Luton last season. Enzo Barrenechea is a part of this swap deal and just played 2800 minutes in Serie A as a DM on loan at Frosinone. I think he'll get gametime for Villa this season and could surprise people with his quality.  If Ross Barkley is signed too, they would have Barkley, Enzo, Kamara and Tielemans for two midfield spots, plus McGinn who can play there too which is solid depth. Man city have a sell on clause for luiz, Ive heard around 20%, so this helps less with PSR but we end up getting more value out of luiz then if we sold him for straight cash They’ll get well more than 28m for PSR. That's just the difference in valuations. Luiz’s will be likely 50-70m, depending on how cheeky they want to get. You paid 50mil for Luiz, that's hardly an inflated fee. Most Villa fans would have wanted to hold out for at least 70m had it not been for our PSR issues. Either way it's fine for villa. Let's say the 10% sell on is true, then it's + 54m net in for Villa. Their problem is more for balancing the book than lacking the actual fund. Ok, thanks for explaining. > The bonus of doing it this way is, for Villa’s example, if Man City have a sell-on clause for Luiz with Villa (say 10%) they only need to pay £2.8m instead of £6m  This part isn't true, you still have to pay 10% of market value, determined by the clubs, but ultimately decided by the Fifa courts. Wait was he really that unbearable? I thought he was doing well at Juve As good as he was last season, that still feels like a pretty significant downgrade from Luiz.   I guess Tielemans and Kamara would be the first choices, but I’d be worried about depth if Barkley was the backup to them. Barkley is a good value, but I would be a lot more comfortable going into the season with a better player Lmao. No there isn’t!!! There was a buyback clause and that’s expired. How did this get so many upvotes. Get some source. I think we valued him at 50m Euros with 11+11 for SIJ and Enzo for the 28+22  Which is honestly lower than most villa fans would value him at even in £ has nothing to do with fees being inflated. The accounting standards, that also apply to Villa, stipulate that a swap needs to be conducted at book value, not a transfer value. The sale side of a swap should result in 0 capital gains for both clubs, with the only net impact of the transfer being the difference residual book values of the players being traded. This is what Juventus previously got in trouble for, by trying to pass these off as individual and independent transfers to avoid having to follow that standard. Technically any gain over 0, is inflated, and so it is generally misunderstood that the values juventus was attributing to the deals was the trigger and issue. This is not correct. Had the judge accepted the deals were independent then the numbers could have been infinitely higher without issue.   As of last year juve used the Dragusin/Cambiaso swap, which has a net impact on juve's financials of less than 0.5% of revenues, to trigger another legal case with the financial authorities to try a set a precedent that would allow juve to do swap deals by using valuation models supported by data and third party consultants.   The main issue is that a player's sporting rights are difficult to value accurately and consistently, hence why the accounting standards stipulate a trade at book value rather than a transfer value to avoid book cooking. In an independent transfer both sides want the opposite - to pay the lowest fee for the player, and the other to receive the highest amount. In a swap, both parties may be inclined to inflate values to reach certain short-term financial targets.  Instead of going with the previous route of claiming they are independent, juve is trying to argue that it can in fact value players accurately and consistently, and therefore does need to follow the standard normally required for intangibles of this nature.   As it stands, only juve is scrutinized for doing swaps, whereas it would technically not be feasible financially for anyone to do it. The difference here is that because juve is publicly traded, the authorities have more insight into their accounting. Juve argue this is unfair and are trying to find a way to level the playing field.  Technically juve should have waited until the conclusion of the Cambiaso/Dragusin case to safely advance with a precedent in place. Seeing as how the net impact on the books was less than 1%, any ""advantage"" gained would have been neglible and therefore could have avoided any serious punishments. To go balls out like this with these mega swaps, before having that cover, is risky AF imo. Its not like the authorities have treated us leniently in the past here so if they lose it will be a big drama. Remember this won't be the only swap deal of the summer, and there will be a lot of activity resulting in much more significant capital gains. First I’ve ever heard of sell-on fees being based off market value. Where did you hear this? He did well this season but hes out of contract next year and in order to renew hes asking for Juve to double his wages. Tielemans probably is our Luiz replacement. I’ve heard talk as such. The others are mainly squad players/players for the future which I’m happy about. Tielemans was incredible last season once he got going. Luiz isn’t really a DM [deleted] Someone who worked for the FIFA court. It's not based on market value perse, but if you do a swap deal, you're still forced to valuate the playersale fairly. Of course he is… Yeah Tielemans is a really good player, and Kamara looks like he could be as well, but all it takes is one injury and Villa would be playing Barkley at DM.   If I were a Villa fan I’d be wanting to see the club make a bigger name signing to replace Luiz. Manchester evening : “However, his former club did reportedly retain a sell-on clause.”  Absolutely no sources 😂.   MSN: again no sources.   Ornstein etc, the actual reliable ones haven’t reported jack shit. Both those articles are equivalent to twitter made up crap. I highly doubt there still is a sell on clause. Wouldn’t be shocked if there was but we haven’t heard any credible sources about it. With what has been happening recently, I wouldn’t be surprised if teams have it in the smallprint of their sell-on contracts now.  But Luiz signed in 2019 so I doubt it was stipulated back then. Dougie isn't a dm btw, his departure doesn't affect that issue. Kamara is our main DM, and he is superb.  I think that’s just semantics. He plays as one of the two deep midfielders in Villa’s team. Some would call that a DM and some would call it a CM. But injured:( His role is not a defensive one, he was our playmaker, he was more of a box to box 8. So I would never call him a defensive midfielder. It's not semantics at all. Dougie is a bad defensive midfielder. Anytime he's played it on his own he's been okay at best but usually closer to terrible. He's best as a deep 8 without actual defensive responsibility where he can work his magic. Would you ever call Declan Rice a defensive midfielder? Right, and I and a lot of people would call a deep 8 a defensive midfielder because they do more of a defensive job than an attacking midfielder.  Which is semantics.   It’s really not that deep. Depends on the role he's playing, rice started as a centre back and goes between playing 6 and 8, his best qualities lean towards his off the ball abilities although he is good on the ball and has improved a lot in that regard over the years.  Dougie is straight up not a 6 though and we were wasting him ever playing him their, he's a number 8 and should play box to box dictating the play with a more defensive minded partner. Those people would be wrong? Me you don't have a chance A defensive midfielder that doesn't play defense? You're talking about two very different positions. Fucking hell. People will argue about anything. Where do you get the energy? I certainly don’t have it.   You think one thing. I think another. That’s fine.   It’s not that deep. You're the one arguing man. You said something that's not true, you were corrected, and then dismissed it and called it ""semantics"". It was worth correcting because Dougie leaving does not mean that Villa need to sign another DM at all. It has no effect on it.  He was originally a defensive midfielder and is still labeled as one in FIFA. So all these people on r/soccer think he's a 6 but he's not at all. When asked to play that role he doesn't do it well. Okay 👍   Have a good evening."

I’d bite their hand off If I was Juve Sounds like a horrble deal for Villa how good is Douglas Luiz? Should I be excited? How has Iling-Junior been btw? Wish he never left but haven't kept up too much since he moved to Juve Why is arsenal not in this? We have been looking at him for years Juve are stupid if they accept that. Aston Villa literally have 3 weeks to sell or get fucked by FFP Psst.. How about an ESR for some help with PSR? So Juve actually agreed on selling Iling ? Madness This is for sure not real. A two for one plus cash swap? LOL If he's really on sale I dont get why no other club outside Juventus are in for him..  I mean Douglas Luiz is one of the best playes in the world in his position, regular starters for BRAZIL NT, the fee: €60-70m is an affordable amount for at least another 10 clubs and Aston Villa need the money so don't have big leverage.. Except Mckennie is shit Be funny if Villa pick him up once this financial period ends. I mean I am with you and they should suck a dick but according to transfermarket.com douglas luiz is worth 70 mil, and mckennie and iling together worth 41 mil so, on paper they are giving us a discount too. Guess it's somewhat time sensitive that's why they are rushing things. Emery probably will get a lot out of McKennie and everyone seems to rate Iling-Junior highly. I said recently, I can see player trades increase with PSR floating about. The consequence of that will be some really one-sided deals early on as teams adjust.   If you're judging McKennie as the fat kid at Leeds it's going to look a really crap deal. He looks sharper now and is a solid box to box midfielder. The wildcard here is Iling JR. On paper he's an England youth international that can play a few roles and looks like he has the raw skillset to fit in at Premier League level but will need work.   The ceiling on him is hard to gauge. Throw in he's in the last year of his deal, the book value is probably what 15-20m? Throw in a similar for McKennie, and then 20m on top and you get the 60m they want for Douglas Luiz give or take.   The reason I say Iling is a wild card is because if he delivers on that potential he's going to be worth a lot. Last year - my team, Newcastle - paid about 30-35m for Livramento and Hall. That's the going rate for a promising young fullback. Very good all around player in his prime. Physical, great technique, contributes defensively, offers goal threat. No personality issues or scandals that I'm aware of.  Borderline elite depending on who you ask. Probably fits into most teams because of his versatility, he is a modern 6/8 tweener if that makes sense.  I'd be excited, I'd love to have him at Arsenal personally. He's a good player, always a goal threat, strong on the ball and can play a great ball in behind a back line. A bit like Xhaka in his last season for Arsenal just needs a good defensive option in midfield to partner alongside, which I assume Juventus probably have. The only player in the villa side I can confidently say is better than Luiz is Martinez. If he does go I'll be very sad. He smashed Alisha. He's very good. He's very very good, especially when paired with a strong DM. We were unplayable in midfield when him and Kamara were together. His form stepped down when Kamara got injured, and was an outright liability when Tielemans was injured and he was forced to partner with John Mcginn Talented young player He has so much potential but did not get much playing time under Allegri who preferred kostic last season Brilliant for that one game vs Benfica 2 season ago, after that he is just kinda mediocre. Kostic was bad last season but even Illing still can't compete with shit Kostic.  I don't think he is good at WB as his defensive attribute is lacking and will be better if focus on attacking. His main asset is his pace but other that that I don't see anything special in him. But maybe Emery will bring the best of Illing, he is still young. He was played out of position for like 80% of his playing time and his playing time was not a lot but he showed he got something to offer. He looked good in some moments, i would be sad if he leaves without gettin a real chance over a whole season in his position. he could genuinely be worth more than douglas luis in the future. he’s amazing. I hope we are just working very quietly to get this done.  It's a dream scenario -- we'd be fools not to attempt to capitalize.     A team being forced to sell quickly, eager to unload a talented player we truly covet that will instantly elevate our squad?    With the funds to get it done *and* an appealing situation for the player??            This type of situation doesn't seem to happen for us ~~often~~ ever. Sadly as much as we’d all miss ESR I’d make the deal plus some cash for Luiz. He has one year left on his contract For Douglas Luiz yeah they’d be mad not to Not sure what happens with selling, but as of now Illing is 4th winger at best (behind Chiesa, Yildiz and Soule). Obviously someone (and likely a couple) are going to be sold, but a decent price for Illing and he’s gone. I think most of the clubs that can afford him don't need a player like him at the moment. bored cows bedroom follow sharp engine outgoing sophisticated rain plants   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Arsenal were interested before and could be again Has been pretty good outside of that Leeds stint, and looks to have taken a next step at Juve last season. He's not great but he's versatile and has some value  Iling is widely viewed as a talented young player as well, him + 20M on top of both players is a decent offer TBH They would need to give him record wage. He is making 7mil net at Juve right now and asks for 8. In Villa no one earns more then 5mil at the moment Transfermarkt isn't a gospel for market. most top deals happen at a rate far from their valuations. They're not some ITK entity or statistical syndicate who leak or dictate prices. They're just as pointless as live result apps or video games. He wasn’t your typical box to box midfielder this year. He was so effective at Juve because he played right wingback just as much as central mid. He has a great delivery from wide areas ans is is a great 1v1 player, both offensively and defensively. He still struggles on the ball and lacks composure in congested midfield areas which is why Allegri would have him and Cambiaso swap positions during build up Ayy the tweener reference. Cheered me up after this depressing thread  > good defensive option in midfield to partner alongside, which I assume Juventus probably have.  Not really Honestly if his season was flipped and his first half of the season was how his season ended, the entire fanbase would be absolutely losing their shit but you know how villa fans are and some soured on him a bit because he wasn't as good in the second half of the season, even though there are obvious reasons for that.   He was moving like the best midfielder in the league first half the season and his partnership with kamara is elite, I imagine if he's going we'll be looking at youri taking his role. He  ~~smashed~~ *smashes* Alisha, they're back together again A player we truly covet? Ornstein says otherwise https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/18ns8kk/david_ornstein_not_everyone_at_arsenal_is_fully/ (and personally I agree for the amount Villa value him at). Two years ago we'd make that deal too. Now? ESR has been injured or benched most of the time and Luiz on his day is a top 5 mid in the league.    Have to be a fair chunk of cash  Look at us selling Iling, Chiesa and Soule to buy Saelemaekers. God damn Fuck you. You have so many great youngsters. The u23 team was such a success fuck you bitch :( Arsenal are pretty keen but I can imagine Aston Villa being hesitant to sell. I doubt Villa are worried about valuable players they must have made £150m from finishing in the top 4, they need depth and quality for the tough CL games and extra fixtures they'll now play. €7m net is like over €13.5m no wonder Juventus has had some financial trouble if that's what they are paying players. Absolutely can't see Villa paying that they have high wages but relative to the rest of the non big 6 sides. Thats why I said on paper. Right, but Villa won't be signing him as a right wing back. His versatility will be nice for rotation as they adjust to CL football, but they'll see him as a midfielder. Perhaps those elements you outline will pitch him more as as Mezzala or an 8 that crashes the box.   Villa aren't typically a team that have to play low blocks often, so tight spaces won't be an issue. They tended to do their best work in transition so he'll be well suited to that. Ornstein was answering a question related to the Jaanuary window.  After it was already clear we were not looking to sign anyone.  However 2 very important things have changed since he answered that question:         1. -  We are now looking to buy      2. - Villa are looking to sell.  Fast.           I dont expect *everyone* to be all-in on every player we sign.  But it's clear the important ones are convinced -- considering just as your article states, we were in for him a year prior.  (And that wasn't the first or last attempt). To me, that clearly seems like a player we covet.   The only thing in the way was the price.  If Villa are now more flexible-- I expect us to be all over it. We also don't need Smith rowe Well that escalated quickly. Project has been an awesome success thus far. But it sucks that the first generation of standout next gen grads are going to get sold to cover for previous mismanagement. I think with the time limit it's just not gunna happen. Also for €60m-€70m Arsenal can do better than Luiz in my opinion and might as well push things up and get Guirmareas or really go for De Jong. > I doubt Villa are worried about valuable players   You would be wrong. By most reporting, Villa are in or close to being in trouble with PSR—it's the entire reason why there are transfer rumors around Douglas Luiz to begin with Due to growth decree its actually barely above 8m gross It's not even on paper though Teams have definitely started dropping deeper against us now that people know we're good lol. I hope I’m wrong but it seems to me that Villa still want more than they did in 2023, so unless that changes I doubt we go for him. Well yeah that too lol  I think it's realistic to say that this will happen to most generations of U23 graduates.  Keep one or two, the very top of the crop, and fund our transfer market with the others. I thought that ended recently? Regardless no chance Villa would be matching that. yeah that happens a bit - happened to Newcastle this year - but it won't happen regularly. It ended but the deals made under it are still in effect. So his new contract wouldn't fall under it? Well that is too complicated for me to tell. I read some journalist saying that as it will be extension of current deal it will be still under the decree, but that sounds dumb so im not sure to believe it."
