Certainly looked good from what I‚Äôve seen of him. 14 G/A this season in the PL. How much did Villa get him for?  I have it in my head that this is them making a loss on him but I actually have no idea what the fee was.   Damn. I really like him What a waste I think the main thing that happened was that nobody expected the levels leon Bailey reached last season. He was absolutely incredible, dragged villa through some difficult games and actually showed a lot of leadership. He became what we'd always heard he was previously.   As for diaby, he started very well, then around one of the international breaks he picked up a knock and was never able to get the same consistency back. I think Morgan Rogers coming in in January and then showing incredible improvement in the space of 5 weeks, while diaby seemed to lose all confidence was probably the beginning of the end.   I still think he's a good player, but seeing his confidence rock like that and others come to the forefront makes me think this is probably best for all parties I‚Äôm not that upset about this. He‚Äôs obviously very talented but it‚Äôs a decent sum and he was very inconsistent. Still a large ‚Äúwhat if he stayed another season‚Äù to it though. Shame it didnt work out for him here but we can't be turning down big money for bench players.  The bigger shame though is he's basically ending his career, which still had big potential, at 25. Explains the talks with West Ham about Kante, Al Ittihad are at the leagues foreign player limit and need to sell to free up slots Says a lot about someone's character to go to Saudi at 25 years old Moussa Diaby accepted Saudi money üòî Isn‚Äôt Aston Villa going to UCL next season? Why are they selling so many players? Like I heard that they sold Luiz for correcting the record on their books but I thought that would be enough. Is Diaby the last or more to come? Incredible business by Villa Theres been many players already wanting out of Saudi... how can these players see that and still want to go there lol im surprised to see 55M for him, seemed like the trend for Saudi clubs was to lowball with transfer fees while turning players' heads with insane salaries moussa diaby, accepted saudi money Stupid decision, look at Bailey, after he settled he was our best winger, and Diaby didn't even have a bad season, he just needed time to adapt, double our profit yeah and signed Philogene for a fraction which is a silver lining but really wish we gave him another season. Final details being finalized finally Jacob Ramsey would lock the starting place? What the fuck WTF! One year ago, he was one of the best Bundesliga wingers then transferred to Villa where he's playing pretty well. And now you're telling me he's going to Saudi??? Whattttttt From an outside perspective, Villa have a lot of quality but also seem unbalanced af.  Maatsen, Moreno and Digne all at LB. Surely 1 will go.  McGinn, Onana, Tielemans, Barkley, Kamara, Ramsay, Dendoncker looks good on paper but surely Dendoncker will be sold so there's only one #6 and several #8s.  Philogene and Rogers are facing a huge step-up from Championship football to replace Diaby.  Is Duran still leaving? Dobbin from the Everton Bench and Archer from that season at Sheffield Utd are huge drop-offs from Watkins.  I have no idea about the 2 Juventus players who signed tbf. [deleted] Emery will find a better replacement and I'm genuinely terrified of who it might be a shame to see him leaving the prem already, really surprised by that, but i guess he is muslim so higher incentive to want to move there It‚Äôs sad when they go young like that I don't get it last year they already wanted him and everyone praised him for chosing the PL instead. What changed? Probably the numbers on his contract but still You guys think Leverkusen would‚Äôve won if he stayed? I guess he can always comeback after securing his retirement paychecks. It feels as if he is about to get really good very soon; he is definitely one of the exciting players in EPL. another one bites the sand. Is it actually 55m ‚Ç¨ inc bonus? Reports recently said we wanted 70m ‚Ç¨ as total package Go get that bag king What a shame but can't blame him we are selling him because he is shit, not for profit. [deleted] Bum The Oscar way He‚Äôs only 25???? Mf im still in college at 26.  Makes me sad ngl. feels like any pro nowadays got enough money for their lifetime when reaching 20 already Yeah I feel like I'm being gaslit here. All I heard this year about him was how Villa have a great player and that he's had a great season. He was patchy. Started great then and injury and form fell off. By the end of the season he looked like he was really lacking confidence (apart from the Liverpool game). He's clearly an exceptional talent and given time I think he would shine. But Bailey has the right wing nailed down and he would probably be better there. The 10 spot didn't suit him a lot of the season, especially when teams packed the middle. He was bench for most of the second half of the season 30m? one sec let me double check  edit 34.2m  edit 2. Im confused. https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5641212/2024/07/18/moussa-diaby-aston-villa-transfer-saudi-arabia/ says 34.2  https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/22/aston-villa-sign-leverkusens-moussa-diaby-in-club-record-51m-deal says 51 +10ish ¬£34m plus bonuses (though who knows if any of them have been met), so a tidy-ish profit on a player who didn't have a great season and wanted to leave. Probably get him on loan in year mate One of your own now he's weak, cant beat a man, one footed, doesnt suit the prem.  looked good in the bundesliga where every teams defence plays on the half way line. not really, not good enough for villa so.... yeah get that rumoured 15 mil a year moussa. Still think Diaby has higher ceiling. Watched a lot of Villa last season but dont see the Bailey hype so big. Diaby played well considering it was his first season and out of position mostly.  Sadly it will be hard to manage their minutes and the offer seems to be very good. Emery is building something good Decent sum? 55m is pretty good How was his attitude? He was always waving and gesturing at his teammates when he was playing for us. Not really.  If he fancies coming back at 27/28 it‚Äôs certainly not to old. He‚Äôs going to playing all the time, obviously not to a high standard. Why is it ending his career? Little over the top Kante would not be one to leave if we‚Äôre talking about freeing up slots lmao  We‚Äôve freed up 4 slots and if we were to do more, Luiz Felipe or Jota (if we do get another winger) would be first. Don‚Äôt forget that we also have 2 extra slots for 2003 or younger players.  Al Ittihad is holding into Kante and would only let him go for financial reasons. He has been by far our best player last season. Diaby wants to leave and if we can make good Money on them then I'm find with losing players who don't want to be here. With his sale we will definitely be getting a replacement and depending on outgoings we will be signing more players. Tons of moving parts right now. I think this deal mighta been in the works for awhile though.  I dont think we are done with this transfer window either. Seems like weve done our homework and tried to build up the team based around stats. Villa was terrible at aerial duels and now we have Onana coming in, stuff like that. well hes very religous for a start. mecca is like mecca to muslims. Money and lots of it People keep saying this while most players have not been leaving You're basically getting a chance to retire earlier, I mean, I would take it every time. [deleted] First thing I thought of, lol. I think Rogers takes his spot with Ramsey on the left. But other than Watkins and Bailey starting everything feels fluid.  Although honestly Leon is sometimes better coming on at 60 mins to scare the crap out of tired defenders so who knows You're forgetting barrenechea, he would be the backup to kamara. Rogers has already been good and we will sign a replacement for diaby. He's going to pull Nico Williams out his ass or revive Felix's career lol¬† you totally can. footballers exist because of fans, and everybody playing for saudi basically just shows a middlefinger to the fans - because the saudi project is not for fans, but for sportswashing Hard disagree 6 goals and 8 assists in his first season in the prem is far from shit¬† It's not a small club, it's more of a medium sized club that got relegated. Marathon, not a sprint my friend. So was I, got my first ""real"" job at 28. Don't worry, you'll get there. 28 and still in college. You got this üí™ Mate half my graduating class in is masters or PhDs and they're 30 or above Footballer career average: 8 years Football average salary: around 300k for first division football (that's like i don't know, 10% of pro football players?)  You probably made the right choice, mate We haven‚Äôt even started smh, why did we kick a ball more growing up are we stupid? at least you're not selling your soul Na, his season wasn't great but it wasn't shit either, he was inconsistent, started well but faded. I was hopeful he would improve in his second season because he's obviously got ability. From August to October he was insane but then really fell off and was pretty much useless until March, suddenly afraid of 1vs1 dribblings or just using his speed. He then started to be more confident and creative again. 2 really great, 1 good, 2 okayish and 4 really bad months in his debut season I'd say. He wasnt really that great. Started very good but were pretty mediocre to bad whole season. The guardian says a max of ¬£51m with add ons included. Athletic say a base of ¬£34m without add ons.  Can't imagine many, if any, add ons were activated. Maybe one for qualifying for CL.  It was never announced as a club record deal by Villa, which has been the case for previous transfers such as Buendia. See the Guardian figure is what I had in my head but then they're calling the Onana deal a record transfer.   Maybe the Guardian have conflated Euros and Pounds He‚Äôll be back somewhere in a year or two I reckon. Bummed a bit because he was so good for Leverkusen and to see him finally break into the PL with that start last season was great. Then he fell off a cliff‚Ä¶ reckon most Villa fans are indifferent on this and are glad they made a small profit I know it‚Äôs said half jokingly but people been saying this for years and it‚Äôs not happened.  The prem even made a vote in the middle of Newcastle‚Äôs injury crisis to say that you can‚Äôt loan off related parties then stoped caring about that whenNewcastle‚Äôs injuries had subsided.   The vote failed and a loan still didn‚Äôt happen. he's weak, he's outta control, and he's become an embarrassment to himself and everybody else You're doing too much mate, he actually started well but was inconsistent overall. Bare in mind the position he played for us isn't the position he played for Bayer leverkusen, it was also his first season. You've made it seem like he was drinkwater level bad lol, he was hit and miss not outright bad. Sounds familiar Like Mane Mate, don't make Villa fans look bitter and sad. I'd expect that from the Gunners fanbase (for much of last season, saw their fans shitting on Emery despite what he was doing with us).  Diaby looks like a player with potential- no worse than Bailey did in his first season. At the moment though, he doesn't walk into our starting 11 and that's something we can't afford for a record signing. There are times he looked like an absolute star- there's plenty that he's shown to say he's good enough but there's no guarantee that he will get more consistent next year and with Duran going the club is probably looking for a player who could play support striker or replace Ollie in certain games. If we were Man City wealthy, Emery would have kept him the same way that City kept Grealish after a middling first season. mate you became fourth once. He appeared in all your matches...   He's not ""not good enough"" for you lmao He was prob gonna improve and be good enough. For his first season I thought he was solid at least. He just was unlucky enough to end up behind Bailey going God mode and then he was just struggling later in the year You're in for a reality check next season, just like the one our fans who spoke like this got slapped with. Lol. Who the fuck are you guys?! Maybe you're right on ceiling. But Bailey was absolutely unplayable at times last year and just wins you games on his own. Diaby might have become that this year, but it's not a guarantee.   Plus Morgan Rogers has really impressed everyone and looks like he's ready to take that spot Isn't that pretty much what Villa paid for him? It's quite hard to play and train at a much lower level for 2/3 years and then bring your level back up to that of a top European league, though. Not really. Going to Saudi is essentially retirement Wait... Al Ittihad's fan has a Reddit account? That's what I get for trusting Wikipedia [deleted] How has Jota been for you? Who is your target for that spot ? Big if true¬† Underrated comment There's been Henderson and ASM, plus lots of rumours about Benzema. Other than that I think all the big names have stayed. So many players have been rumored of wanting out... Benzema, Mahrez, Mane, Kante, Firmino, Jota, Gabri Veiga.¬† Big names?... its mostly players over 30. Who really in their prime went there? Ruben Neves, who has in the Championship a few years back, Mitrovic who played most of his best football in the Championship, Jota who came from Scotland, Veiga who had 1 good season at Celta Vigo, Laporte had been in and out of Citys team the previous season and always struggled with injuries anyway... their signings haven't really been that impressive.   Even this transfer... Villa wont be sad to see him go, he wasn't that great. Certainly not 55m great. It‚Äôs a bit more understandable for a Muslim player to go and player there though. The most holy locations in all of Islam are in the country. You know there are saudi football fans right. What nonsense os this statement. stats merchant I'm reasonably certain that I can't run a marathon, and I'm not willing to try. Surely that's more a symptom of how bloody good villa were last season? In any normal villa side he'd have been considered a massive success of a signing who the club would be desperate to cling on to for as long as possible, but since the rest of your team upped their level so massively and players emerged in the same position to become big stars a very very strong first season ends up looking ordinary.   From the outside totally a bizarre transfer, as a toon fan I was gutted you pipped us to him and for much of the season was assuming¬† that he was a key element in what Emery was achieving. [deleted] Yeah im not sure.  I really liked him personally. Played lots of games, had big moments, he gets compared to bailey and bailey is definitely awesome too, but people also dont really reflect that what got bailey so much credit was how impactful he was when he got subbed on. And the reason subs are impactful can often be with how the two players can trick defenders with different skillsets.  Defending for 60+ mins vs Diaby then Bailey comes on and Boom. I loved how well that was working for us. ‚ÄúYears‚Äù? Saudi league teams became active in the football market one single year ago‚Ä¶ saudi prince probably forgot they own Newcastle. I mean they already got World Cup so they wont push hard anymore Fragile ego, fragile body, weak mind, weak spirit Why he say fuck me for We were watching a different diaby then. And so were unai and monchi.  Bailey was playing under a shite manager and had bad injuries, lazy comparison to make.  Diaby pissed me off so much last season, and dont come at me with stats, he benefitted from a good system, put rogers there and the output will be even greater. hes meant to be our star player and hes on huge money and doesnt get in the first 11. massive gamble to hope he comes good next season. did you watch the premier league last year? They paid around 35m so have made a decent profit Maybe but if Witsel and Carrasco could do it, I‚Äôm sure he can as well They don't force a player to stay there for life. He could be back in a couple years. The ones who are out or extremely close:  Hamdallah, Romarinho, Grohe, and Hegazy  Whether Jota or Felipe leave is of course up to which transfers we get and their age, but they‚Äôll most likely leave if we continue looking at the market like now.  Also, Demiral is not in Al Ittihad. He plays for our neighbors, Al Ahli. He missed the first half of the season due to not being in the squad. When he played in the second half, he wasn‚Äôt particularly bad. He was just outshined by our other young winger, Ahmad Al Ghamdi. In most matches he showed moments of brilliance but his decision making was questionable. One thing that I noticed, he disappeared in most big matches that had great fullbacks. He‚Äôs still young and not that experienced so I won‚Äôt be too harsh on him. Benzema was by far more disappointing due to his already established experience and recurring self injuries. Felix, potentially I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we don‚Äôt sign anybody immediately.  Leon Bailey was one of the best players in the Premier League last season and his form was keeping Diaby out of the team at times.  Emi Buendia is fit again, he was our club record signing before Diaby and the only player who played in all 38 games in the season where Emery took over (2022/23).  Morgan Rogers came in from Middlesbrough in January and was really really good, McGinn likes to play there when possible and we‚Äôve just re-signed Philogene.  We‚Äôve got lots of bodies in the areas where Diaby plays so maybe we just sit on the money until January. Big difference between rumor and fact yes, but let's put it like this  you know the crazy amount of money in football - and the crazy amount of payment certain players receive. This is in direct corroletion with the amount of fans  - and how much value these fans have for brands (marketing, ...)  This is, for example, why men's football has way more money involved than the women's game. The women also have fans and value for brands - but waaay less. Bonmati is rich, but she earny waaay less than Gundogan or whoever  But players in these certain oil states do not get paid because of the sporting value  - they get paid because of something called ""sportswashing"". Here is an article from the guardian about this if you unfamiliar   [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/26/revealed-saudi-arabia-6bn-spend-on-sportswashing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/26/revealed-saudi-arabia-6bn-spend-on-sportswashing)  Basically, states like Saudi Arabia try to improve their image and generate soft power and political influence. They don't even care wether these high paid athletes do well sporting wise, they are basically influencers. Clueless lol¬† He played in every match but after a strong start he faded, form was very patchy but he was playing a different role in a different team than what he was in Germany, I was optimistic he would be more consistent in his second season after acclimatising but he's off to Saudi now. Quite disappointing but he obviously didn't want to be here anymore so good we could make a profit on him and try to improve the team. He played in every match but after a strong start he faded, form was very patchy but he was playing a different role in a different team than what he was in Germany, I was optimistic he would be more consistent in his second season after acclimatising but he's off to Saudi now. Quite disappointing but he obviously didn't want to be here anymore so good we could make a profit on him and try to improve the team. Yeah I think he would've had a great second season! He pulled off 4 or 5 world class performances in the first 2 months and you could see after every second match 2 minute compilations online of crazy dribblings, sprints, body feints, passes and crosses he did. He never came back to that level in a single match after that and is frustrating to watch when things don't work out, because he tends to complain a lot tho, so I kind of understand why Villa is not absolutely confident about him. Normally I'd say yes but at the end of the year his confidence looked absolutely shattered. I got the feeling he never really felt good in England. From what I remember he really wanted to go to SA last year (he is a devoted Muslim) but dechamps said he wanted him in a top league to go to Euros and then had a mediocre season and never went to Euros.   He looked good until he got to the final third and then at times Sunday league players look better than him. I'd have him back but I'd much rather take the money and look for someone else. He is a risky imo Ronaldo was signed in 2022 to kick start the project‚Ä¶ Unexpected Jon Moxley Stats? I didn't mention any stats.   Bailey had Emery since October in the year before- let's not make out that Bailey immediately turned into a class player. Do some basic research, there were plenty of fans wanting rid of Bailey at the start of last season.  And don't compare yourself to Emery or Monchi- I trust them much more than you. Fact is, Diaby still played in every game even if he didn't start. Emery clearly appreciated him, as I said its just we can't afford a player who cost that much to not be a guaranteed starter.  No one is saying that he hit the heights expected last year- but there is plenty to show he could still do so. If he was anywhere near as bad as you are painting him out to be, he would not even have been making the bench let alone having minutes each match. Take a chill pill and try to get some perspective. Why would he not improve in his second season? He moved to a new league and country last season, surely there is a settling period.  Leon Bailey moved from the same league and improved significantly in his second season. Yeah id agree with that too. If we get to make a profit and with the rise of Rogers and Philogene, I think it's acceptable to sell him How comes he‚Äôs going for so much? If he‚Äôs on high wages and not been very good then surely he should be going for less than 55 million? Not doubting what you‚Äôre saying but it seems like a very high fee.¬† No. But if y'all overachieved then kudos; but the guy has scored 14 goals in European comps, how is that not good enough for  ""VILLA"". With add ons it was ~¬£50m.  We don‚Äôt know if he reached those add ons though. Paulinho did it and started for Barca Yeah I wouldn't say hes ending his career also....maybe out of the Big Friday lights of European football, but look at Saint- Maxim. He's moved to Fenerbache now.   Diaby is young, he can still move around. If he isn't drawing other clubs in the market, what can you do? If your club is pretty much saying, we can't turn the money, so you can leave. Jesus Christ.... my guy no one is watching the saudi league for moussa diaby, and al ittihad has been filling their stadium for decades already, they signed him because they want to improve like any other team does The whole league spent ‚Ç¨45m on players the summer ronaldo was signed on a **free transfer** vs ‚Ç¨977m the following summer. He played out of necessity! we were barebones.  Emery clearly doesn't appreciate him thats why he is being sold!  I watched every minute of him last season and me and monchi have come to the same conclusion. Get rid. And you don't agree with us, thats fine, you think you know better. Not OP but his confidence just didn't seem to be there. Like he'd do a great job until he got to the final 3rd and then just forget how to play.   Villa just don't have the money to hope that their star signing manages to turn it around. I'd much rather take the money and look for someone new.   Bailey is a bit different too. Bailey early on was injured and had Gerrard to deal with. He also had confidence issues but you could tell he was still going for it and I had more confidence he could work it out. Bailey I think is due for a regression, he was making some nasty goals and some people had some nasty finishes for him. Still a good player and will be important next year but I don't see him getting 10 G/A, more like 7 each. Bailey also cost half of Diaby so I don't have a problem with him coming off the bench from an economics perspective. Lazy comparison. Bailey has bad injuries and played under stevie g. everyone looked shit.     Diaby is not going to magically become better. Thats why he's being sold, but yeah you are a united fan good luck sticking with anthony, maybe he will improve LOL. He still got 10 goals and 9 assists in 50 odd games from the wing or support striker. It's decent numbers he was just very streaky. I guess we paid ¬£34m + bonus so to sell him after a year we'd want a profit.   And honestly at times he was excellent, just inconsistent and got stuck behind Bailey being at times the best wide forward in the league. Patchy, would probably do well next season, but if we get a good offer he's not unsellable - at the moment he's a first or second off the bench player, and for someone who cost that much and is on ¬£120kpw, we aren't the sort of club to just spend that on a sub really  Plus Saudi offering to more than double his already high wages, so I get why his heads turned It's an opinion shared by very few Villa fans don't worry. Personally I'm gutted to see him leave, especially if the fee is as low as is being reported here. Short version: delulu prem merchants we are in the champions league next year lil bro Well we beat Arsenal twice, City once, Spurs once, 4 points off Chelsea, probably deserved to beat Liverpool at home. Idk if youd call that overachieve, obviously we did something right while being led by one of the best managers in the world. Our run started in late 2022, not just one season. In 2023 Villa was the 2nd (iirc) best performing team in the league, and the performance against City has been hailed as one of the best ever against them. Youre showing a bit of disrespect to Emery  He's behind Leon Bailey so theres just no place for him, end of really. He was a record signing but doesnt walk into the starting 11. He went from a goal every 4 games in the bundeliga to every 6 games in the prem. Not enough to chase top 4 realisitically even though he has moments of brilliant class. His 8 europa goals and 6 conference league goals are fine but it'll be Champions League next season. Personally I think he is perfectly good enough as a back up but I guess he wanted to leave.  Wouldve expected more money for him though its barely more than what we paid Pretty sure he didnt. Maybe for reaching the CL. We never announced him as a record signing, like we did with Buendia. But who knows. Cant see what add-ons he would have hit unless its just payment in rates. Idk if you used Saint-Maximin as a good or bad example. Fenerbache is a step down from Newcastle. stop lying [https://www.transfermarkt.com/al-ittihad-dschidda/besucherzahlenentwicklung/verein/8023](https://www.transfermarkt.com/al-ittihad-dschidda/besucherzahlenentwicklung/verein/8023)  [https://www.transfermarkt.com/saudi-professional-league/besucherzahlenentwicklung/wettbewerb/SA1](https://www.transfermarkt.com/saudi-professional-league/besucherzahlenentwicklung/wettbewerb/SA1) Nevertheless the rumours existed then about Ronaldo. They existed about Neves and they will exist for every other Tom Dick and Harry. It‚Äôs still not happening The ego on you- you and Monchi indeed.  We were at barebones and Tim barely got a sniff when we were crying out for a central midfielder. Utter tosh.   Just because we sell a player doesn't mean we don't rate them. I don't know how many times it needs to be explained. He started on fire, trailed off, and showed odd moments in the second half of the season. Again, if we didn't have to worry about PSR we wouldn't be selling him. Grealish was cack in his first season at City, but they kept him. If they were in our financial position, that would not have been the case. You're being way too obnoxious about this mate. I'm really sorry for questioning you on this, I should have known that Villa are a massive club, having finished in the top 4 once in the last 18 years, unlike Man United, who have had no success in that time.  Not sure which United supporters you know who think Antony will get better? I guess we're just less delusional... I get why he would go and why you would sell. But usually a club who buys a player and puts them on a high wage will not be able to sell that player for a profit when he hasn‚Äôt done very well. So the reported fee confuses me (I guess the report and reality might not match‚Ä¶) Nope most villa fans back emery and monchi. No shade on Saint Maximin at all, it's his career at the end of the day. He made his choice and he's now at a club who has Jose Mourinho as their manager, playing for a club who finished 2nd in the Turkish Super Lig and are about to play in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League. Plus he's playing with talented folks like Dzeko & Tadic. the smaller teams drag the average down like most leagues outside the top 5, here's sc braga for example who are similar to ittihad as the 4th best historically in their country  https://www.transfermarkt.com/sc-braga/besucherzahlenentwicklung/verein/1075 Antony obviously has talent, but he should trust in his right foot way more(he actually had a decent right foot at Ajax) and he needs to keep it so much simpler in the Prem. I feel like I never see him just throw a quick feint and just accelerate past a defender when he‚Äôs obviously good enough to do that. I know he‚Äôs not nearly Robben, but what made it work for Robben is he always feinted the shot so the defender never knew when he would actually try to shoot. He's on ¬£120k pw. High wages for villa, not really high wages for Saudi or the likes of PSG, Chelsea, etc. Saudi are offering him ‚Ç¨290k pw/‚Ç¨15m per year so more than doubling. And he's 25 which isn't that old.   I get what you mean but I think it still makes sense Not in my experience, but I also don't see how we can't back Emery and Monchi while also being sad that we are losing a very good player. Those aren't mutually exclusive. that's why I put the first link with only Al Ittihard there as well I have never seen Antony be able to accelerate past a defender, it's very odd. Robben had a burst of pace to get past defenders after a feint, but I just don't see that with Antony.  Considering the amount we spent on him, it would be great if he would get better. But I think most United supporters have given up on him now. Yeah fair just seems completely mad to me but I‚Äôm not up on what they are paying for other equivalent transfers.¬†"

"Catching your (red and) white whale: Olympiacos FC road to European glory!","2024-05-31T15:47:45+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1d4ys4g/catching_your_red_and_white_whale_olympiacos_fc/","The 29th of May 2024 in OPAP Arena (colloquially *Hagia Sophia Stadium*), the 2023-24 Olympiacos squad entered the club's history by winning the Conference League and becoming the first Greek club to add a European trophy in its collection at senior level (after doing the same at Youth Level a few weeks ago)!

***Brief history lesson for the class:***

Olympiacos is historically the emperor of Greek football. ***47*** league titles vs ***41*** for every other team *combined* speaks for itself. But European glory has always been the club's white whale, the goal that was never scored, the one thing missing from the club's myth. There are many reasons for this oddity:

* a mentality that ""the 1st is everything and the rest are nothing"" which led to trophy hunting always being prioritized over deep European runs.
* a team which usually played without much focus or investment in defense (Giovanni and Rivaldo up front, Anatolakis CB is a great example) because its main objective was to break down park-the-bus Greek defenses.
* the club never had the stars align in Europe (which is also needed if you aren't a big league club).

Europe was the only lifeline of Olympiacos' enemies in years of red and white domestic rule: they had memorable moments from Europe that Olympiacos didn't. They also used it as an argument that Olympiacos' local dominance is based on corruption and in Europe, where there is real refereeing etc., the true strength of the club shows.

***Zooming in the last years:***

Marinakis bought the club in 2010 and immediately achieved domestic domination. He brought back Ernesto Valverde, whose football philosophy affects Olympiacos until today, and the club stated regulary getting 9 and 10 points in CL until 2016. A combination of reasons led to a decline of quality and 2 lost titles until Pedro Martins put the team back in a order.

Œïuropean success kept eluding though: despite some great wins, there was always a circumstance putting an end to the European journey - luck, Marinakis firing the coach for ego reasons (Jardim, Bento), GK blunders, covid changing the season, or simply a weaker team at the given moment.

In 2022-23 Olympiacos had a horrible season and Marinakis changed everything in the summer: you can read in details my post from August [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/16a2t13/17_in_30_out_how_a_titleaddicted_club_reacts_to_a/).

***Since then:***

Did you read it? Good. Now throw all the planning and philosophy which was in theory put in place in August out of the window.

It didn't work. Diego Martinez improved the team and quality was added in several positions in attack and the wings, but the defense was vulnerable, the midfield was understaffed, and it went down the drain in November: the defensive performances against Greek minnows at home (despite wins) and the draw against Backa Topola (!) was the warning bell, and the hammer fell against PAOK at home (2-4) and Freiburg away (5-0). These results are not acceptable for Olympiacos under any circumstance, especially heavy defeats from other Greek clubs, and in early December, Martinez was fired with Olympiacos finishing 3rd in an EL Group with Freiburg, West Ham and Backa Topola with 7 points but having only 1 point in 3 Greek derbies.

But it gets worse: Marinakis hired Portuguese journeyman Carlos Carvalhal. He ""fixed"" the defense by positioning the players to sit back which led to not scoring against Lamia, Atromitos and Panathinaikos (twice), the players disliked him (Podence was visibly not even putting an effort) and the season looked lost, with PAOK having a 9 points lead in early February, the team out of the Cup to Panathinaikos and unable to win any Greek derby, much less think of Europe where Ferencvaros was waiting. Carvalhal was fired 1 week before the 1st leg match against Ferencvaros.

Marinakis is impulsive, arrogant and confrontational, and these traits led to the demise of the red and white stranglehold on domestic titles. But he is also very stubborn and really, really hates losing.

Changing 80% of the team didn't work? Let's do it again then in January!

Out go:

And this time...jack-pot!

These transfers transformed Olympiacos for the best. Carmo is a 10 times better CB than Freire and Porozo combined. Chiquinho and Horta are quality, modern midfielders which complement the wonderful Hezze who was fighting alone for months next to unprofessional Mady Camara, and give a role to veteran Iborra in a midfield of 3. Martins gave much needed depth in the wings that Solbakken and Biel had failed to do. Abbey gave depth to the CB position. Navarro was a flop but you can't have it all.

The key to turning a wasted season to a glorious one, the missing piece of the puzzle, was the 3rd coach of the year: **Jose Luis Mendilibar**.

The fans were furious with Marinakis, his entourage, and the players, and there was no enthusiasm when Mendilibar arrived: his EL trophy was treated as a fluke, like Di Matteo's CL because ""Sevilla can win EL without a coach"". His work at Eibar was disregarded as ""it's a small club, what does he know about having to win every week"". His debut was to be against Ferencvaros....

**Here. We. Go!**

1st minute of the match, Olympiacos defense is sleeping as usually and the Hungarians score. The new coach is destined to fail already, just like that. But VAR to the rescue: hairline offside! The match is balanced, but Olympiacos with the new coach aura and the January transfers starting to glue with the team find a goal with leading scorer El Kaabi (who had missed January because of AFCON) and the morale shifts.

7 days later, Mendilibar is hailed as the second coming of Ernesto Valverde: Olympiacos have won their 1st derby of the season by demolishing league leader PAOK away (1-4) and played their best European match so far in Budapest, doubling the 1-0 wins against Ferencvaros. The draw is kind to Olympiacos: the next opponent is Maccabi Tel Aviv, everyone's 2nd preference after Viktoria Plzen.

Mendilibar has already flipped the team morale, won the players, had luck in his 1st match and his 1st draw, and the next week he gets 3 more league wins while rotating the squad. The 9 points gap from the top of the league is down to 3, the fans who were asking for everyone's head are delirious, and the expectations for breaking the curse against Israeli teams (3/3 eliminations) are sky-high.

The back-to-earth reminder is brutal. Olympiacos' shaky defense, especially when not protected by a 3rd midfielder, is torn apart by Eran Zahavi, Maccabi scores 4 goals in 5 shots and leaves Pireaus with a shocking 1-4 win.

The next day changed the course of the club forever: against all odds, Marinakis announces (through press leaks) that Mendilibar signed a new multi-year contract. And when the Basque has a tactically bad match and Panathinaikos leaves Piraeus with an 1-3 win a few days later with the crowd booing everyone, Marinakis doesn't change his mind: the message to the players is that the coach isn't going anywhere, start performing.

Was it their bruised ego? Was it football wanting to reward a good decision over an impulsive one? Was it Maccabi thinking they're already through?

The match in Topola (Maccabi used it as ""home"") had everyone rubbing their eyes in disbelief: Olympiacos went to HT leading 0-3! And when CB Retsos gifted a penalty to the Israelis, the psychology shifted back with usually clumsy El Kaabi scoring a bicycle kick (!) and veterans Jovetic and El Arabi completed a mircale in extra-time: 1-6!

The draw was again kind, and the opponent in the 1st QF since 1999 was Fenerbahce (note: Greek clubs and Olympiacos in paticular are not afraid of Turkish clubs. In Greece they are considered as ""rich but not necessarily stronger than us"". I recall Turkish fans here seemed to think Fenerbahce is a club of the size of Porto or Ajax and clear favourites - in Greece they aren't seen like that. It's just the Greek fans and media POV, not an attempt to belittle Fenerbahce).

Until then though, the league campaign suffered a severe blow with an away 90th minute defeat to AEK in a match where Olympiacos was good but not clinical, with only slim hopes remaining for the title. But everyone's mind was in Europe.

Olympiacos entered the home leg pressing the error-prone Fenerbahce defense at every chance they got, and got a 3-0 lead after 60 minutes. But another stupid penalty given by Retsos plus lack of depth which brought fatigue allowed the Turkish team to make it 3-2 and a very close return leg...which started very wrong for Olympiacos, 1-0 down early on. The match ""froze"" for a big part and in the penalty shoot-out, Tzolakis who became starting GK at the 2nd leg against Maccabi Tel Aviv, saved 3/5, including the 5th one by Bonucci, and sent Olympiacos to heaven.

A rotated side managed to beat PAOK at home, dropped points to Aris and beat punching bag Lamia, and thanks to AEK's poor results vs PAOK, the title chase was also still on, with 3/3 wins in derbies needed.

Nobody was focusing on this: Olympiacos has a lot of titles, they can survive losing one. All eyes were on the prize: Aston Villa and the prospect of a final in AEK's stadium!

What followed was football giving back to Olympiacos what they deserved over the years: a perfect referee and VAR referee who didn't give any ""home advantage"" to the ""big league"" team, a perfect finishing night from the striker, and timing, always timing. Aston Villa scored early but the goal was cancelled because on an offensive foul (from the ones referees often miss), and Olympiacos shocks Villa Park in a counter attack with El Kaabi using Cash's heel to beat the offside trap by 1mm! 13 minutes later, El Kaabi doubles the lead with Mendilibar's press doing wonders against Lenglet and Olsen. Villa bounces back though, with a goal at the end of the 1st half (a limping Ortega couldn't follow Watkins) and equalize early in the 2nd half with Diaby catching Tzolakis by surprise. At this point the match reminds the Yassine Meriah-induced fiasco against Tottenham a few years ago, but this time Olympiacos doesn't crumble. Douglas Luiz gifts a penalty, and El Kaabi (who never misses penalties) completes his hat trick. 10 minutes later, Hezze who had never scored for Olympiacos tries a shot outside the box...deflection, Olsen doesn't react quickly, 2-4! Villa press a lot but tactical freezing of the pace and Luiz sending a penalty to the stands send Olympiacos back to Greece with the 2-goal lead.

In the week until the 2nd leg, reporters and English fans had started an irrational hype about Emi Martinez returning....forgetting that Villa needed 2-3 goals and a goalkeeper, even an elite one, doesn't really help much in that.

In a flaming Karaiskakis stadium, El Kaabi says thank you to Podence and Quini serving him a tap in on the counter and Villa has a mountain to climb and neither the stamina nor the morale to do it. Iborra and Carmo dominate the air, Retsos avoids his usual catastrophic error per match, Tzolakis is there when needed, and Villa has more or less the pointless possession that Spain's NT had in the World Cup.

El Kaabi puts the cherry on top with an identical VAR-verified goal: everyone believes he's offside, but a defender's heel keeps him onside. 2-0 and the dream of every Olympiacos fan (and nightmare of AEK and not only) is reality, final in Athens!

The league title is lost against a spirited and focused PAOK 3 days later. The club really wants to screw AEK for many reasons (mostly because of a fat Slovak referee gifting them a win in January in Piraeus) and beat them at home, sending the title to PAOK's hands. The domestic season ends with smiles after drawing Panathinaikos from 2-0 down and securing Europe for the next season.

The final is recent so I won't go into much detail: in an expectedly tactical and close match, Olympiacos made the dream come true in the way that the last 2 months went: El Kaabi goal in 116', dancing on the offside line, and VAR confirms that for the 3rd time he managed to find the millimeters separating glory from defeat!

Olympiacos caught their Moby Dick, lifted a European trophy in a season which was borderline disastrous for several months, filled haters with despair and fans with ecstatic joy and changed the club's history forever.

***The golden team of the club, by order of matches started:***

https://preview.redd.it/argksj27vq3d1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba929943966b48c707dc10dda899b8179e09094f

https://preview.redd.it/nvmla979vq3d1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f1a574583d8fc9968af7f2dd2ae8a4fbd610f7

**Rodinei:** The best RB seen in Greece for many years, Rodinei is what Olympiacos fans dream from wing backs: a player with the technical skills of a no.10, who fearlessly runs forward and terrorizes opposition defenses when matched with Fortounis. He does leave gaps behind and isn't tactically very aware of crosses from the other side, but if he did that he would be in the Premier League. He almost became the black sheep when Livakovic saved his 5th penalty, but thanks to Tzolakis this moment cost nothing, and it would have been a huge pity for Rodinei. A cornerstone of the triumph!

**Hezze:** The soap opera tranfer of August was worth every second of waiting. Hezze started running in the summer and never stopped. A tireless athlete with the stamina of a long distance runner, the tactical awareness and tackle timing of a modern DM/CM, who held the midfield by himself every single match until February due to poor transfer planning, who also always has the clarity to pick the prime option when passing. The 22 years old Argentine was a hidden gem who shone very brightly once competent players played alongside him in the midfield, and got his personal reward as well with a goal in the Semi and the assist to the title-winning goal! Several European clubs are greedily looking at him, but there is the feeling that Marinakis is not going to sell him this summer.

**Retsos:** The most controversial player of the squad throughout the season. Retsos is an amazing CB 90% of the time, with an excellent ball-playing ability which made Leverkusen spend almost 20M for him when he was 18 years old. The other 10% of the time he has brainfart moments which usually lead to goals. In several matches throughout the year, he ruined his own excellent matches by giving an easy penalty or getting a red card or losing the ball where he shouldn't. He also had the bad luck to not get away with any of these errors - almost everything got punished with a goal while mistakes of others didn't end up in goals. This resulted to a lot of social media hate, peaking after the home match against Fenerbahce when his needless penalty kickstarted the return of the Turkish team in the tie. Nevertheless, he was still the 2nd best CB of the team and managed to not let his rollercoaster season affect him negatively in the final sprint, performing flawlessly against Villa and Fiorentina. If he stops the brainfart moments, he will become the best Greek CB ever.

**Fortounis:** The team captain lived a moment legends of the club were dreaming of. After 2 ACL injuries and a falling-out with Pedro Martins, he proved to everyone that he can make the difference at European-level pace, he can cover his wing back effectively (a chronic weakness of him), he can combine his lethal through balls with playing from the side and not strictly as no.10, and that Gustavo Poyet commited a crime by not having him in the national team (he rated Bakasetas more, lol). Fortounis gives solutions when matches get stuck, he opens the defenses and his creativity is a tool Olympiacos relies on so frequently that it's often taken for granted. He deserved this moment maybe a bit more than the rest. Top assister of the season!

**Paschalakis:** The starting goalkeeper for most of the season, dropped before the 1-6 against Maccabi. An old style keeper, with a huge body, very good reflexes, but with terrible ball-playing abilities and afraid to leave his line to clear crosses and corner kicks. Which was the reason, in parallel with the 7 goals in 3 days conceded to Maccabi and Panathinaikos, that Mendilibar changed him with Tzolakis. He had spectacular moments when the team wasn't well and there were many threats for the defense and accepted the secondary role in the end of the season with grace.

**El Kaabi:** Another amazing story reaching its climax. El Kaabi arrived in the summer with a career in Morocco, China, Qatar and one season in Turkish minnow Hatayspor. Noone was enthuiastic about him, and despite him quickly proving how easily he scores, there was still a lot of criticism about his limitations to control the ball and ""break"" it to the side and the fact he wasn't as technically skilled as prime El Arabi. His month in AFCON coincided with the team failing to score in many matches, and from February onwards he became an Olympiacos fan's dream of a striker: he was there in every single big match, finishing almost every one-touch chance he got: with his head, his feet, even a bicycle kick! He was what was expected from Tiquinho, from Oscar Cardozo, from so many bigger names who have passed from the team and never managed to be at the right spot at the right time as often as El Kaabi. 16 goals in Europe (2nd scorer of the club, in his 1st season!), 33 in total, 11 in 9 matches in the Conference League. 2 against Ferencvaros, 3 against Maccabi, 5 aganst Aston Villa and the golden goal of the final. That's an Olympiacos CF, the one the fans demand and rarely get to see. Clinical, always on the right side of the offside trap, present in big matches, 0 injuries. A player with an unremarkable career became a hero at Olympiacos and his name known in all Europe. What a story!

**Masouras:** When Olympiacos is struggling, Masouras is always there to fight and give solutions. When the team is rolling, he stands out negatively more often than not because he lacks the technical skills and quality a winger needs. Masouras became a bench player in the last 2-3 months and added his own part in the road to the title, as one of the clubs oldest players.

**Ortega:** The 2nd Argentine August arrival was the starting LB and had a lot of ups and downs. Tactically he isn't at the level he should be and makes it up with fighting spirit, technique and overlaps. He isn't Hezze, but covering the position occupied by the (hated by almost the entire fan base) talentless Reabciuk for 2 years, he had something rare: time. The bar was so low that there was patience to give him time to acclimatize and develop. As the rest of the team, he stepped up when it mattered and his 1st season in Europe ended ideally!

**Podence:** The short legend! When he got sold to Wolves, Olympiacos suffered for years, unable to find a winger of his quality. From players who are usesless without open space (Bruma), overweight players (Rony Lopes) to downright joke players (Onyekuru) and players who didn't give a shit (De La Fuente), everyone failed miserably to replace Podence. His return was greeted with joy and he showed why he is loved and was so hard to replace: the team's best dribbler, he improved his weak finishing in England (2nd scorer and 2nd assister of the season), he loves Greece and the club and gave everything he had most of the time (apart from his falling out with Carvalhal), he has a character and and an ego, he wins a lot of fouls, he is a tiny demon messing with every defender. He scored the 1st goal of the miracle against Maccabi, a screamer against Panathinaikos, he served on a silver platter to El Kaabi. Him, Hezze and El Kaabi were the summer transfers who changed the image of the team the first months.

**Mady Camara:** The less said, the better. An ungrateful, selfish player who believes he deserves to play in a bigger league and a bigger team, reluctantly stayed after Roma (and nobody else) wanted to buy him, chose to try hard only when he was personally interested, and was iced out of the team in January for refusing to renew and get sold, opting to leave as a free agent. Enjoy watching your teammates celebrate from your sofa, Mady!

**Ntoi:** An academy product, 20 years old, Ntoi was a DM in his youth career and was turned to a CB by Michel last season. He has good and bad qualities, not ready to be  a starter for a team playing a high line but giving it all in Istanbul when he was needed in the return leg. He was the 1st bench option at the position for most of the season and he is with Tzolakis and Retsos one of the academy players who wrote their name in the history books with the title.

**Quini:** In Olympiacos, when you are a more limited player with a role to offer solutions from the bench, you are either a fan cult figure of a lightning rod for blame and hate. Quini zigzagged between the two, and his step-up when it mattered the most was one of the X factors. A veteran RB with a career in Segunda, he was asked to play LB often (thank Richards for being always injured) with mixed to poor results for most of the season. But with Ortega out against Villa, he had to step up for 3 halfs against the 4th PL team's wingers, and step up he did. He managed to limit the threats and assisted El Kaabi in the return leg to seal the presence in the final. Everyone played a part!

**Chiquinho:** Among the January transfers, he was the less flashy. Unknown to most people, the bar was low given the multiple failures of the last years when buying players from the Portuguese league, he soon proved everyone wrong and was one of the 3 January signings who turned the season around. An all around midfielder, playing both at no.8 and no.10, controlling the tempo and rushing forward when needed, with Hezze and Horta/Iborra he changed the way the midfield worked and turned the tide. He came with just 500k euros!

**Carmo:** Perhaps a 15M CB is what is necessary for Olympiacos to have a decent defense. Carmo came on loan from Porto in January and showed from his first game that he would be a season-changer. Strong, dominant and confident, he became the leader of the defense and changed the fate of the club. His block in Fiorentina's chance in 121' was his personal rubber stamp to a season his arrival turned around. Porto's asking price is high, but there's hope Olympiacos will manage to keep him. Best CB after Ruben Semedo and without criminal tendencies. He is worth every euro.

**Tzolakis:** Among so many stories, the one of Tzolakis is the greatest. The 21 years old goalkeeper was second for most of the season, with his performance in a few matches in previous seasons being lukewarm. Mendilibar made him starter before the return leg against Maccabi, valuing his quick thinking and skill to play with his legs and come out of the box when needed, and nobody could image what would follow. The young GK played with the confidence of a seasoned veteran, had flawless matches against Maccabi and Fenerbahce and became the ultimate hero in Istanbul by saving 3/5 penalties! From there with morale sky high, he was a rock until the end of the season, with 2 clean sheets in the 2nd Semi and the Final, and from another young prospect who was thinking of leaving to find playing time, you're looking at the starting GK of Olympiacos for years to come!

**Alexandropoulos:** The former Panathiniakos youngster on loan from Sporting scored one of the most crucial goal of the seasons: the equalizer against Genk in early August when half the squad hadn't arrived yet. His contribution came in the less flashy part of the season, but it was just as valuable. He didn't find much playing time the last months since Mendilibar preferes technically skilled midfielders and he's a bit clumsy, but if he stays there's a lot of room for improvement.

**Horta:** A technically artistic albeit a bit soft CM, Horta gave much needed solutions and filled the midfield of Olympiacos with quality and simplicity. Releasing pressure from Fortounis and Podence, sometimes from the bench sometimes as a starter, Horta was another missing piece of the puzzle which fell in place. He also put the nail in AEK's coffin with 2 goals which took the title out of their hands!

**Navarro:** You can't have 100% success in January transfers. Navarro is not a great goalscorer, he can't do much against parked buses, doesn't have the positioning of El Kaabi or the skill of Jovetic, and it's frankly a mystery why Porto values him at 8M.

**Iborra:** Extreme makeover, football edition. Iborra in a 4-2-3-1 system looked like a geriatric dinosaur, unable to follow the pace, slow, tired and generally useless. Mendilibar saw something in him though and when he changed the system in a 4-3-2-1 with both Hezze and Chiquinho alongside him, the 36 years old Spaniard turned to a leader in the pitch: calm, methodic, dominant in the air, he was a different player and lifted his 5th European trophy, with significant contribution to it!

**Biancone:** A rather mediocre CB with no attributes to make him stand out, he played in league matches mostly before March.

**Jovetic:** The Montenegrin veteran stayed away from injuries, with the correct usage (coming from the bench), and proved his quality: technique, experience and big moment goals, with the 5th against Maccabi his highlight. Everything you can ask from a substitute forward!

**Carvalho:** A meme player who cost the Greek Cup with a missed 5th penalty, mediocrity and lack of mental strength, a Mendes plant who made a career with almost zero skills to play anywhere above Rio Ave.

**Biel:** A player completely unfit for the brutal environment of Olympiacos. He rarely managed to show his talent, he cracked under pressure, he doesn't fight back but his performance takes a nosedive if things go wrong. Shipped to Augsburg in January.

**Richards:** The medical center's permanent resident, he showed flashes of quality, but what's the point if his body is made of glass?

**Freire:** A wrong transfer from the start, a mediocre player, error prone, not a great match with any of the other CBs, left in January. Night vs day compared to Carmo.

**Gelson Martins:** A proper winger, with acceleration, dribble and threat to the defense. Not in the European list because only 3 changes were possible in January, but he rested the starters in the league and is a big hope for the next season as long as he stays healhy.

**Porozo:** Average, never justified the hype, not worse than Freire but his lack of an EU passport led him to being ommitted from the squad more often than not due to league rules, and left in January.

**Solbakken and Scarpra:** Flops of the season. Came with much fanfare and high expectations, and offered nothing. We're still waiting for a player coming from Forest to be in the ""good"" and not the ""mediocre"" or ""bad"".

**Abbey:** A prospect CB who came from Reading in January, showed raw talent in several matches and will play more next year.

**El Arabi:** A club legend says goodbye in the best way possible. At age 37, he couldn't have the role he was used to, but what better way to close his career in the club? His last game was the winning final, his last goal was the 6th against Maccabi Tel Aviv. With 20 goals he is the club's top scorer in Europe, in the top 10 scorers overall, and the most talented all around CF seen for at least a decade. Thanks for everything!

**Vezo:** A Mendes transfer, probably in a silent deal to bring us the good Portuguese alongside. Didn't play much, not sure what his level is, he is no Carmo though.

**Vrousai:** Academy player, on loan to Rio Ave to find game time.

**Cabral:** He got injured at the only part of the season where he could have found minutes. Came as an extra solution for Greece, can't say we saw it.

**Brnic:** Started the season strongly but with Podence's arrival he couldn't find space in the squad.

**Apostolopoulos:** Academy player who debuted with the first team against Aston Villa! Mendilibar proved he isn't afraid at the slightest with his debut.

**Ramon:** I forgot he played. One of our many mediocrities out on loan.

Apart from the obvious (the title itself), Olympiacos won the chance to change the next years for the club as well: the direct spot in the next Europa League league phase means a proper pre-season without qualifiers. It means planning without must-win matches in the summer.

Can only hope my club has a moment and a season like yours again soon Excellent post all-around, a fit and proper description of what would become the best season in our soon 100-year history. It still feels unreal that just one year after we were being trashed by Haifa and Qarabag that we would beat Villa and Fiorentina and win our first ever European title. Keep it up!  Also something last about Carvalho, regarding his meme status. He was a starter at Mendilibar's first match against Ferencvaros and someone in the Olympiacos subreddit posted about beginning a road to final with him as a starter, and then he became something of a cult hero (although still, he never stood out in any match he played and was in general painfully average) This is a wild journey. Star content! Long time Olympiacos supporter, and can attest to the high quality of your analysis, historical context, ebbs and flows of the season, and player analysis.  Well done and thank you! Quality posting alright.  Top summary."
