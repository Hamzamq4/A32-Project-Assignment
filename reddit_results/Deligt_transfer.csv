"[Plettenberg] Manchester United, not willing to spend the €50m + add-ons demanded for Matthijs de Ligt at this stage. Therefore no final offer to Bayern yet.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* those bayern fans who signed the petition will be happy lol Wonder if they take another real go at Branthwaite after another sale or two? Reality is, we do need a second centre half signing though.  Varane being let go, Kambala being sold and open to offers on Victor means another centre half has to come in.  Could just be playing hardball with Bayern or may actually favour getting Jarrod (though not willing to pay his price).  Maybe there's another option out there, Tah from Leverkusen? We don't want to spend £50m on De Ligt, so we're spending £50m on an 18yo instead? Don't get me wrong he seems like a talent, but I just feel like De Ligt is worth the money more than Yoro is at this time. De Ligt is worth the money and fits them like a glove, specially since they are signing a promising but still green CB in Yoro. This is just juggling negotiations and finances, I believe in the end he will be a United player. Such a statement signing from Ineos. Incredible signing.   Zirkzee and Yoro being the first signings in the new reign is very exciting. LETS FUCKING GOOOOO Hope he stays and shows how fucking good he is, most fans want him to stay.   Also great to see that Real finally doesn't succeed every time with this bullshit. My only concern with de ligt is whether he would solve the passing out from the back issue or not.  Anyone who has watched him regularly got anything to say about his ability to pass under pressure? Fuck me sideways and call me Shelley if we get another Kroos situation and De Ligt ends up at Real. This will come back and haunt us. 🫠 GETTT INNN Spending more on Yoro than De Ligt is actual insanity  Don’t do this, don’t give me hope… For those saying the concern is about wages, De Ligt is a proven defender in multiple leagues, not yet in his prime and has got desired qualities like being able to comfortably play with the ball, strong leadership, strong aerial presence in both defending/attacking. Can also resist player from pressing, intelligent movement off the ball.   After seeing United throw silly money at average players for years, funny how they now have concerns when it comes to him. They’re kind of throwing silly money at Yoro who’s 18 - but when Real Madrid are chasing him then there must be something really good in him.  I know De Ligt has injury concerns, but it’s better than the likes of Varane and Shaw but not elite like Bruno. They are manageable and I reckon he can play about 34-38 games a season.    All I know is that it won’t be shocking if Real Madrid swoop in for De Ligt in this transfer window if they don’t end up with Yoro. He can fit in their backline comfortably seeing that Bayern aren’t putting much of a resistance to keep him. H O L D Please stay and become our future captain Mathijs 🤌🏾 Typical United policy at this point. They punted on an aged CR7 and Casemiro and decided enough was enough for spending on established players I think we sell Lindy and reinvest in De Light though Lindy is our only true LCB backup...so not sure how this works? Please Newcastle, just try. I don’t love the De Ligt deal - I think Martinez, Yoro and Maguire is pretty solid with more than enough cover from Shaw, Evans and Lindelof. I’d rather put that 50M towards strengthening RB  and DM. But that means Dalot/AWB leaving first.   Also, I worry about LW/RW - we have Sancho, Rashford, Garnacho, Amad and Antony but they are almost copies of each other in play style. Mixing that up would be beneficial. But not sure who on that list would be sold.. Us (Liverpool) should be all over him So we'll pay way over the odds for a wonderkid who'll be off to madrid in 5 years? instead of a world class defender who wants to come in MDL? fuck sake, not happy about this Ah damn Ig we gotta keep him now, how unfortunate. Liverpool? If they pull this off good on them. But I still wonder if real Madrid aren't going to come flying in off the top rope and snatch him. We definitely need another CB, but this is a great strategy by United to try get the price down by a player who seemed to have his eyes on OT already. This is the sort of shit Chelsea are great at doing, may as well act like a big boy in the game if we are big boys in the game, Ineos have played this summer so well An established experienced player and a young potential talent.  I don't think the two are mutually exclusive somehow. 50m is really good price. Wonder why other clubs are not going after him So they would not spend that money on someone who actually has a big experience and played for big teams but spend on an 18 yrs old kid who plays in Ligue 1 , yes this sounds like United to me. At the same time you're gonna have to wonder why nobody seems to want such a great player. scenes when jim ratcliffe adds his name to the signatories  the man is already thinking three years ahead to when bayern's inability to offload de ligt's wages and ongoing kane-induced trophy drought has sunk them financially to the point where they are forced to sell all their best talent for peanuts Ornstein said this “The Premier League team maintain their admiration for options such as Matthijs de Ligt of Bayern Munich and Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite, although a further arrival is likely to depend on departures to create finance and squad space.”   This is where the Greenwood sale helps I imagine. Think we have to sell now before we can bring anyone else in I feel they prefer Branthwaite but i dont see Everton selling unless we give them what they want They would have to meet Evertons price tag. Think it was reported that with the sale of Onana they don't have to sell Branthwaite and intended on keeping him. Don't see him going without united overpaying.   Edit: Yeah, on the Orny tweet from the Onana sale he states it all but ends any chance of Branthwaite being sold barring a huge bid Doubt it. I think it was Yoro OR Branthwaite. We might want De Ligt for his other characteristics, but there's no way we will pay the 70-80m minimum Everton want. Fuck I really wish we go for De Ligt over Jarrad. We need that experienced brute. I don't want Yoro and Jarrad to be in the limelight and under scrutiny as much. I feel De ligt can handle that. Plus he's proven and experienced. Branthwaite is gonna close more than this I imagine from Everton, personally I think De Light for now is the much better option proven over the years and well worth the cost for Utd. Man United wouldn’t entertain coming close to the £70m asking price  If they think we’re going to entertain anything lower than £70m after Man United have just spent like £55m on an 18 year old with one year left on his deal then they’ve lost the plot  It’s have to be a ridiculous deal for us to sell  We already want to sell Holgate and Keane after already selling Godfrey  Which would leave us with Branthwaite and Tarkowski as our only 2 centre backs If another CB were to be signed, I'd bet it'd be a left footed one to cover Martinez.  Hence the Branthwaite interest that was in parallel with MDL/Yoro, who are both right footed.  What I'm worried about is that there are no new rumors regarding DM. Ugarte rumors have quieten down, hope they pick up again after Copa finished. [deleted] Two that I'd feel would be realistic and are left footed are Murillo from Forest and then Hancko (also covers left back then). They'd come in a lot cheaper than Branthwaite The zirkzee sale gave 50% to bayern as a good bargaining chip, so we might get de ligt Tah went to bayern already but the 18 yo wont have the wages of de ligt. de light would be looking for 200k per week awhile yoro wont be remotely similar You have to consider total spend over the life of the contract. It's probably safe to assume it would be much less for Yoro considering his wages are presumably lower than De Ligt As one who could contribute to you immediately, maybe not but total cost (transfer fee + salary + commissions) and future sale value makes Yoro a more appetizing deal. Still expect you guys to buy another CB, Lisandro - Yoro - Maguire CB rotation seems slim and honestly worse than other top 4 competitors Yeah. De Ligt is literally the exact type of player Man U need. They need guys with character and leadership.  The price they were gonna spend on him was insanely low for this market too. Would have been great business.   Yeah bit of a strange one. Varane wages are gone too. I would say they are also as cynical as it sounds, are thinking of how he clearly sees himself as a Madrid player eventually that this future sale if he becomes world class like many think he could be. That future sale is gonna be massive. An actual sensible response for once. Yoro is geniuenly better than de ligt lol We can sell Yoro in 3 years' time for double this price. That's not possible with deligt. I know that's not 'big club' behaviour, but we are not really a 'big club' any more. Need to be smart financially. This way we get a world class prospect playing for us while also securing a big sale option for the future. This is a very Brighton like deal. [deleted] I get that yoro is 18 and so good at such a young age but for the same price wouldnt u rather have de ligt a proven amazing defender who is just 24 and has a great personality as a captain at the age of 19 ... Can any of them pedal fast? Well another update says, we still want one more cb and that's dependent on sales He was mediocre in that regard for Bayern. My straight answer is no. He’s rather safe with the ball and will look to distribute it immediately to the nearest man. Once in a while he’ll make a decent pass between the line but still his movements looks kinda stiff, and don’t expect him to run forward with the ball (could be a coaching thing). And if he’s the LCB then I’m not that confident if we have to face, say Man City or Arsenal press  He’s a great pure defender though, so with a complimentary piece and not much build up responsibility he’s your man. A great vocal leader as well Martinez is great on the ball and passes under pressure, as long as he stays healthy I imagine he will be doing most of build up play from the back. Is Yoro better? I mean Yoro isn’t all that great at it either yet he is a lot more reserved on the ball upvoted for the use of the old English adage ""fuck me sideways and call me Shelly"" Yoro is a once in a few years opportunity, MDL we can probably put on hold for a few weeks until we've made a few sales. But De Ligt has had so many injury issues throughout his career, always a chance things get worse when he joins United, This is just a tactic. It's very simple, we can't buy MDL until we made a sale because we got Yoro, but now we play it off like we're not going through with the deal because of the fee. We wait a few weeks until we raise funds, go back to the negotiating table and get him for cheaper while we're at it. Real don't seem like they want to drop €50m on a defender, if they'd bid €40+10 they would have gotten Yoro over us easily.   Most likely they go for a cheaper alternative Who's Lindy? Yea yoro might be good but signing de ligt for this cheap would be a way better deal imo. De ligt is only 24, its not like he is old there are reasons why managers don't want him (basically he's not a modern centerback and gets paid too much for what he brings to the table) but reddit hivemind loves him and doesn't accept that. The idea of bayern, the club known to be managed super well (up until recent times), falling into mediocrity because of the Kane curse is so funny to me Jim Ratcliffe is a billionaire tax-avoiding Brexiteer, who's also one of the worst men I've had the misfortune to meet when I was a union convener at one of his companies. Acting like he's some genius is disgusting. Squad space could imply we might have to sell some CBs too We want to convince Jose to buy Lindelof too.   I think we were hoping the Sancho sale could be combined with Greenwood money to make a move for Toney but Sancho appears to be staying for the time being, probably because Juve were never going to offer proper money for him.   So there isn't really room for 2 €50m defenders in the squad, but we still need younger, better cover for Licha imo More like getting a decent price for Maguire or Lindelof, I think. We tried selling Maguire last year and couldn't agree a price with West Ham and we've been offering Lindelof around this summer.   Licha, Yoro, Maguire, Lindelof and Evans is fine. Knowing our injuries problems it probably won't be, but it's hard to justify another €50m CB until another one is sold. Is this what it's like to be run properly? We also got news that west ham is interested in AWB and few are looking at Mctominay. If they get sold it would give us more room to work with. I need Casemiro gone yesterday, we need a midfielder so badly. Think we still have the funds to replace Amrabat. Then we’ve filled the spots of the three players that left at the end of the season.  Then we’re into ‘sell to upgrade’ territory I think  We've been very stern on the fee and haven't budged at all which is good to see because we always seem to fold. With the Onana sale being inevitable (IMO) I can't see us selling Branthwaite at all then unless an outrageous figure is thrown out. It was Branthwaite and Yoro/de Ligt. >after already selling Godfrey  Cant believe you sold the first Elden lord, big mistake understandable, see you next summer transfer window it's 41 million pound plus addons, why are you deliberately lying?? Why the downvoted but the most sensible take. I don't see Everton selling one of their best CBs this season if they don't need too. Now that onana is on his way out.   It would be nice for the league if Everton stays and also for Brainthwaite to stay at Everton. Out of interest, would you take 55m + Maguire for Branthwaite?  no ones paying 70m for Branthwaite lol, the kid's clearly very talented but there's probably a reason every top club was after Yoro and not Branthwaite, his real value is probably closer to 40-50m when you deduct the english tax I see people mention this, but it's not as if Zirkzee wouldn't have moved if not for us. Bayern were getting that 20m regardless. It was a sell-on clause, United or Milan or whoever was going to buy him were going to pay Bayern that much regardless. It's not a bargaining chip at all Why would that affect the De Ligt deal? It's not a bargaining chip, it has no influence at all They're not going to knock 20m off because we bought Zirkzee Its always these united fans. He hasn't, the ITKs are saying Bayern want to sell de Ligt first before going for Tah. Personal terms have reportedly been agreed to, though Also a fair point, I just think we need a De Ligt more than a Yoro right now. Hopefully we get both. Also Yoro has greater sell-on value. If he develops, we may be able to set a record fee for a defender if he wants to move somewhere else (he’s apparently a huge Real Madrid fan). De Ligt is still young but I don’t know of he will ever be more valuable than is today. Why are we acting like 200k is overpay for De Ligt? He's 24 this isn't like a Casemiro situation.   Even then, if there's one club that should not care about wages its United. I mean, Yoro’s gonna be on very high wages as well Exactly, and I would also assume that Ten Hag prefers Yoro. It's not like Yoro will be earning breadcrumbs. Its for 150k/week lol I don’t see the reason why you’re being downvoted.  Deligt is no better than he was 5 years ago. Yoro has more upside. I fear that you in fact cannot sell Yoro for 100 million lol. > but we are not really a 'big club' any more.  You literally have this backwards. Financially you are absolutely still a giant club and can afford any wages. But transfer wise yes you're not a big club, which is why you should be jumping at the chance to sign someone like De Ligt instead of worrying about the resale value of a 24 year old. Madness. Both clubs fan bases think he was their best CB..  My guess is the wages, but even then I would still have done it So, Ornstein says that we maintain our admiration for MDL and Branthwaite but we would need to sell in order to make more purchases so there's a chance we might still go for MDL.  This means we will most likely sell one of Lindelof, McTominay or Casemiro. Agreed. I’d rather have de Ligt. Plus the fact that he wants to come while Yoro wanted Madrid. I hope I’m wrong but I agree. He has potential but it’s a huge fucking risk. Has De Ligt improved from when he was 19? Tbf I don’t think deligt is an amazing defender. I need you guys to sign Branthwaite so badly Are you making a lot of money back potentially? Because right now just for your defense youre spending spending And Juve. Amazing defender though >so with a complimentary piece and not much build up responsibility he’s your man.  That would make De Ligt a perfect partner to Licha. Ah, yes, I'm a lot more confident with Upamecano facing Man City. But doesn’t that then become quite predictable, with all the passing going through one side of the pitch? Than De Ligt? Right now no tbh but Yoro is 18. Lindelof In the eredivisie subreddit people couldn't believe that United would pass on a world class centre back in favour of an 18 year old. Just goes to show people still have De Ligt from Ajax in their mind, he never really fulfilled that potential. It can happen to any club really. Dreams can’t be buy in years to come it will emerge that kane signed some kind of pact with the devil while he was on loan at norwich, blessing him with remarkable talent in exchange for never winning silverware  that's why he was strolling around so lazily in the final, he can see beelzebub in the stand shaking his head at him Yeah true. We’ll have too many cb’s. Probably Lindelof He might just be further down the list but as a casual observer it feels like they should be sniffing around David Hancko. Cheaper, and can cover LB. Although he may not want to be a rotation option.. >couldn't agree a price with West Ham   I thought the price agreement with West Ham was done. Iirc the hold up was what we would have to pay Maguire to offset his lower salary with West Ham. That's what we couldn't agree on. Correct me if I'm remembering wrongly though. I thought wages were a hold up for Maguire since we’d need to pay the differential if he was going to West Ham. Plus he still wanted to fight for his place at United  Good news is that the Saudi transfer window opened today, so might see more movement now. How you feeling about Onana leaving? He’s an exciting player.  Ye i have the same feeling. Only way we were getting him was Everton financial trouble but onana sale probably gonna deal with that  Unless he somehow suffered back injury due to great sadness and/or we pay up, he will stay Reckon Madrid will go in for him next season (If Carlo is still manager) Its a €62 m deal Literally always factored in?? Like every deal people just include the addons. Sorry, I meant €70m No, I don’t want a player that’s coming on the back end of his career in exchange for one of the best upcoming England talents  The wages of Maguire alone would completely cripple all the work we’ve done to reduce club expenditure >there's probably a reason every top club was after Yoro  There were 2 clubs actively after Yoro, Real Madrid refused to go above €25m, Man United went over double that   >and not Branthwaite  This time next year most teams will be, Man United are quite literally still wanting him  >his real value is probably closer to 40-50m when you deduct the english tax  He was valued at £70m because we DID NOT WANT TO SELL, why is this such a hard concept to understand?  You're literally paying way above Yoro's valuation which is lowered given he's in his final year of his contract that's fair fair I don't understand your snark, I just made a mistake? De Ligt would've been a less risky signing imo. Worth the money >Hopefully we get both.  We do need both. We are just one injury away from seeing Yoro and Evans partnership. Martinez came back from an injury not too long ago. And he's not had a rest all summer. Can't expect him to be all rested and fully recouped for the upcoming season. Yoro can't and shouldn't be expected to start 20 games for United. We need both.   De Ligt's wages are a big issue. His price tag or any price tag can be amortised to assist the over financial portfolio, but wages canNOT. If he signs for 5yrs and gets paid £200m pw (he's currently on £250 pw) then that's £52m in wages (a total of £100 - £120m on one player). Whilst Yoro (£42+10m) with a reported (but not confirmed) wage of £112 pw will cost united only 29m in wages over 5yrs. So a total cost to united for Yoro over 5yrs will be £81m. With a possibility of selling on for at least half if not for a profit. Whilst De Ligt will only reduce or may be his last big club move.   This to me makes sense of why we should go for Yoro first and then De Ligt if we can get some sales through. Why would you want both. He's also had 7 different injuries since he moved to Bayern, something to take into account. About £113k per week before bonuses apparently, so closer to half what De Ligt would be after. He always prefers players from the netherlands idk about prefering yoro tbh it's not. He’s gonna be earning a reported 112k a week, so I think we can say that’s better wages out of the two options in terms of priority and upside. [deleted] Yeah no of course not, defenders don’t go for that much, I was exaggerating. But we will be able to sell him for a profit if it comes to that. For Manutd that in itself is a huge win considering the last 10 years of making colossal losses on most of our signings. Even if we break even it’ll be fine. Also there is a chance that he might fall in love with the club and become a stalwart player for us. And that chance is not minimal. >Madness   Oh please, lmao. De Ligt's career has plateaued, he has not developed physically, had knee ligament issues, coming off a season where he's played fewer games than Varane, Juve happy to sell him, Bayern happy to sell him.     Not to mention there's doubts about his suitability for a more cautious role alongside Martinez who will be the aggressive CB that usually De Ligt is. Yeah we have money but the only way we get a shot at true top talent right now, with no cl, is if we get someone with the understanding that they can move on to bigger and better things if they choose to, after giving us a few good seasons. Basically do a Ronaldo. And while we have finances we really need to get maximum value from our transactions. Our previous transfers have been horrendous when it came to value and resale.   As for Deligt, there is a reason why Juve and Bayern both gave up on him. Hes not a defender who can play out from the back, he's great in tackles but not great positionally. And to play well at the top level of football you need that. I would expect a city supporter to understand that. Also I understand why you would want us to take Deligt and not Yoro 😛 Signing those superstars is one of the reasons why we've declined so much. Yoro is 18 years old and we could sell him to a bigger club for like double the fee in the future. [deleted] Yea the wages are a big thing but still man its one of the best defenders in the world at only the age of 24 and is a leader, we need that bcs our other cbs is lisandro also a young cb and maguire who isnt a good leader Frankly I think we almost certainly sign De Ligt as well.  I think we're waiting to build a bit of pressure on Bayern to drop their price as it causes us no problems to do so. We know they very much want him out so they can complete on Tah.  Especially now we seem to be getting Yoro so aren't in desperate need of a signing at CB.  I think we'll see Bayern compromise a bit, we'll sell someone and it will be done. Branthwaite is a good cb, i think he shouldve been picked for the england squad in front of players like konsa and joe gomez imo but still having de ligt and an 18 year old who had a great season and is wanted by real madrid as the other 2 choices while also being cheaper. Its a no brainer we need to give up on brainthwaite Fr he’s gone by 23, basically developing him for Real Madrid No chance they get Branthwaite after how much they’ve spent on Yoro. Doubt Everton sell him for anything less than £70m this summer No way we sign Branthwaite after what we are paying for Yoro. It's either De Ligt or someone even cheaper. The passing of Upa is better in general, but he also blunders more often. For a defender? Not really. They are usually given tons of space anyway when possession settles. As long as the partner is not easy to press, it's fine That's a good point, but I don't picture the execution being quite as static, plus Onana is brilliant on the ball IMO. So De Ligt or whoever partners Licha, will have multiple options, Dalot, Onana, Martinez, plus the midfield. Oh I completely forgot of his existence damn.. so kambwala gone i think Defence line would be Maguire, Yoro, lisandro , Evans, lindeloff and 1 more cb?   Who do you think are first choice starters? Yeah, but when I look at bayern and for how long I have been following football I cant even imagine a fall from grace for them. In my mind it feels impossible. Even clubs like barca who arent managed as well as bayern imo have been doing fine for as long as I can remember.   Thats why its so funny. You would think it requires a huge scandal and a lot of poor decisions for a team like this to fall. Not because one of their players is cursed lol. City dodged a bullet. Yeah I mean look at you guys, hopeful and excited for the season now but the same United shit is going to happen and you all will be rioting again. After last season, there's no such thing as ""too many CBs"" How much does Lindelof fetch though? 10-15m would be my guess. Likely move around 10 given his age. There's been loose links but nothing to really get excited by. Maguire rejected the move, though it was never made clear if that was because he’d have to reduce his wages (United refused to pay the difference) or because he just wanted to stay. Maguire probably did enough teams will be a bit closer to his demands this window right? Do they give big transfer fees? Would he even want to go to Saudi? I think us Utd fans are making a lot of assumptions with the potential Case sale. Branthwaite staying would soften the blow hugely and I’d already accepted he was gone this window but still quite annoying. I do think in dyches system he’s almost a luxury player however and can be replaced with cheaper alternatives but if he signs for villa can see him doing really well there. Easily world class potential 50mil € + 12 million € in addons. So 42mil£ plus addons. Yeah for winning leagues and champion leagues not just for signing, if united spend 62m that would fkking great deal. 50 + 12 add on though. And in Euros.  Isn't Everton asking for like 70m but in pound which is like 80-90 in Euros? It's not 70m euro, still wrong. This comment was powered by the ""Hey just give Yoro to us"" gang. From the analysis that I have read, Yoro might fit his system better.  While De Ligt is good at defending, even at Bayern his competition is better on the ball.  Yoro seems to be great with the ball, dribbling and mid/long passes. Doesnt really help in the Dutch team if you got VVD, Ake and De Vrij in front of you. Most overstacked position in the Dutch NT.   He is 24 with an insane amount of experience. He was 17 when he played his first final for Ajax. Look around this thread lol most Bayern fans want him to stay. Juve sold him because he wouldn't extend.      He ""plateaued"" becaue he was literally world class as a teenager. If Yoro is at the same level as what De Ligt was then he would probably plateaued too. What a stupid take. De ligt is not even close to the profiles united have wasted 100s of millions on. And no, no one is paying 100 mil for Yoro. Juve needed the $$$ and salary reduction.  Kompany wants Tah and they can’t keep everyone. To say he’s flopped is ridiculous.  Yoro is a promising 18 year old. De Ligt was an 18 year old captain, for your manager. CB’s usually take longer than others to develop, De Ligt has been starting regularly since 17.  Just saying 50 mil was amazing business I agree, you guys should’ve taken De ligt. Better player obviously.   Just being truthful, No other agenda Maybe his injury history is concerning? Wouldn't ""one of the best defenders in the world"" start for his club and/or country? Definitely not *one of the best defenders in the world*, probably was one or two seasons back Even at zenith of United’s power we lost Ronaldo to Real Madrid. Not fussed about him going to Real later on as long as it is for a decent profit. Manchester United would dream of the opportunity going back to being Real Madrids youth academy, it beats their current role in the football world Let me dream! As it stands yeah. I think it'll change across the season. Yoro will need time to settle in to the league. I think we'll see Lisandro and then a rotation of Yoro/Maguire/Evans. Lisandro probably gets subbed at 60/70 most games with Lindy coming on. If we sell Lindy then I don't know what we do. Depends how ETH plans to use Shaw across the season. We're short on LBs so I think Shaw will have to play there most games and won't factor into CB conversation.  This is all dependent on any other business we do ofc It kinda feels like the 2006–07 meme season for me Look at what happened to us after 20 years of dominance. For someone who has zero belief in superstition and jinx non-sense, the bayern fall is a culmination of poor decision making and lack of succession planning, than a player who is ""cursed"". I can't find anything more hilarious than that curse narrative. Perhaps. Perhaps some cheating justice will happen after Pep leaves and you're back to a mid-table club. That's football! You can say that for every position. Fact is we only have 25 senior slots we can register. Probably not. He's on £190k/week. Not many clubs can afford that. If he wants to move he has to take a pay cut. Don't think they need a big transfer fee as much as they need his big wages off the books. Taken aside that saudis obviously pay a lot, they are the go to player recycling area now. Whenever a player flops but initially cost a lot, its super hard to sell them to a proper team. With saudi arabia turning into an early retirement home for the greedy teams now always have thart small hope of getting bailed out by them when one of their big buys flops.  Bayern managed to sell mane to them. Its kinda wild. That’s still a €62m deal…. Are you ok? That just isn’t confirmed  Could be appearances based Yeah we are, because we’re not interested in selling at all Saying Ornstein is wrong? I’d take de Ligt over Yoro. Especially for the same price Haha I'm very happy with the squad we have, I was genuinely just speaking from a United pov I’d much rather have De Ligt. Nobody accounting for the fact De Ligt was much more better in the build-up under Ten Hag’s system and that Ten Hag made him the youngest Ajax captain ever  It’s not just a random player related to the Netherlands. It’s the player Ten Hag relied on the most in his best season as a coach That's cool, they're replacing De Ligt with Tah who is a worse player and fans certainly don't care about financial moves that make the team worse. But Bayern the club are happy to sell.   >He ""plateaued"" becaue he was literally world class as a teenager   Thank god no one told this to Messi, Mbappe etc. or else they'd be still be the same level they were as teenagers. What an absolutely hilarious take.   All those people touting him as the next van Dijk should've known, if you're world class as a teenager you're not expected to improve. So you're saying Lamine Yamal is not going to get better. He's expected to plateau in the next few years? 😂 A big name who's injury prone and has flopped at 2 clubs already, what do you mean? Sounds like a classic United signing of the past [deleted] Sorry i was a bit aggresive for no reason lol so madrid could buy him lol, sure buddy. [deleted] for world record fee, wtf are you on?? Yeah LB curse last season was bad Well...nothing happened. Youre still buying players for absurd amounts of money, you still draw in players that other clubs could never, youre still competing in the upper third of the premier league. All that happened was you lost a good manager.  You're still spending money like it's going out of fashion and you've never finished lower than 8th or whatever it is. Yes, by the standards of 1993-2013 you've fell off, but you're not really doing that badly. I am well aware curses dont exist. I just like the thought that bayern makes zero obvious mistakes but suffers anyway and as soon as Kane leaves they start winning everything again. Perhaps, perhaps nothing will happen/slap on the wrist and we'll still be winning PL titles and you're back to being a rebuilding/in shambles club only celebrating the transfer window wins. That's football! 3 GK  5 CB  4 WB/FB + 1 that can be slot into either side on an emergency.  4 CM/CDM  4 Wingers  2 CAM  2 Strikers  So yeah it's pretty close but isn't Mainoo and Garnacho are still U21 so they don't count toward the 25 limit? We almost certainly are not keeping Hannibal,Pellistri,Shoretire and maybe even Diallo. So if all of those are not registered then we only got 21 senior players on the list. And yet we dont know if Lindelof/Maguire leaves and same with Casemiro/Eriksen. Tbh he said a bit closer, not fully onboard.  If whatever sum United needs to cover to move him on is a bit lower, its a bit more likely to happen in theory. True. But we also can't sell him below a certain figure because of the amortization rules. Anything below €42m is a loss on the books and would greatly affect our budget. It isn't confirmed yet you decide to add the add-ons to the fee as if theyre paid already. Nice logic. But you’re the one claiming we’ve lost the plot spending £55m instead when it’s actually £42m base Who increased his fee in every tweet??? Sure. De Ligt has chosen 2 clubs over us in the past. Let him stew for a bit. The fans still have ptsd from all the injuries we had last seasom and de ligt had some concerns which is why sentiments are like that from many fans.  Also, don't you genuinely need another defender? I kinda want to see how De Ligt  will develop under Kompany. I'm not sure or convinced how good Vincent is as a coach, but I reckon he would be a very good teacher for De Ligt. He has flopped neither at Juve nor at Bayern. He has not flopped by any stretch. He does have some injury problems and thus has struggled to lock down a starting spot. But he is still very young and CB’s tend to get better with age. When he plays he looks quite good. Maybe slightly overrated by most in this sub but Bayern is only willing to sell sue to wages and injuries. There is a good player there and some club will benefit from it eventually. Bayern sold kroos to real madrid. How did that turn out? Okay. Doubling down. Got it, you‘ve never seen him play.  What? No.. don’t be ridiculous He's starting for us so I don't see your point. We've been a joke for the better part of 10 years through mismanagement Technically they’re middle third of the premier league Interesting use of the word 'winning', but alright. Heritage is written over decades, a lot can happen, and I wish you luck. The 5th cb is johnny evans Yoro is also under 21.  We are allowed 17 non home-grown players in a squad of 25, so that is another consideration we need to make.  It's all well and good saying we need to offload McTominay,  Maguire, AWB,  Rashford, but then we'll be in real trouble. Yoro is fine since he won't count towards the squad, same for Mainoo and Garna. So, chances are we may need to look for home-grown options for players. If we end up with three new CBs this season, i think Yoro, De ligt, and Colwill could be good. Chelsea are full of defenders, so we could probably nab Colwill for far less than Everton wants for Branthwaite. Which is what the earlier comment was saying. That we have to sell lindelof No…. I’m saying if you expect us to drop from our £70m valuation after you’ve just agreed a €62m deal for an 18 year old with 1 year left on his contract  Then you’ve lost the plot Because he’s getting more and more information obviously And Mbappe messed with us twice in the past too. So what? We also genuinely needed a Benzema replacement last season. Don Carlo makes things work. Tchouaméni will be the 3rd choice. We also have Vallejo. Carvajal can also play there in emergencies ig. Mendy too. And worst comes to worst, there's still Camavinga (only half joking) It's honestly weird that Bayern are trying to sell de Ligt when Kompany got Burnley of all teams to start playing progressive passing football. Like de Ligt is the perfect CB for that. [deleted] ah i see i just ignored the club part By your own standards yes, but youre still right there, actively doing top-team things. Youre still competing where it matters, youre not playing championship (thats the name of your 2nd div right?) football. A quiet period is not the same thing as a team imploding. It would be an interesting use for you lot considering you haven't won  a significant title in some time. Must be rough adjusting to being at the bottom of the big six. I wish you luck as well, maybe United won't be a joke once they get rid of the Glazers and their people officially. MBE Chelsea wanna keep Colwill though? have you tried starting an academy. The homegrowns dont have to be starters We're not bad off as we're not really close to the 17 non homegrown from what I can see.   Onana, Bayindir, Malacia, Martinez,Dalot, Lindelof, Casemiro, Eriksen, Bruno, Antony, Hojlund and Zirkzee are who we have (think Amad qualifies as homegrown).  That leaves us 5 slots we can fill (and that's if we sold Maguire instead of Lindelof and didn't sell Eriksen or Casemiro). Even outside of that, Bayindir and Malacia really could be not included or sold at no real loss anyway.   Selling AWB and McTominay really doesn't put us in any danger if we replace them with non homegrown players. In a good few cases, we're replacing non homegrown with non homegrown How does Yoro being U21 not make him count towards the 17 non-HG spots? Lol you ain't getting Colwill for less than 70m I don’t think anyone expects Everton to sell for a reasonable price and none of us want the club to buy at that price so I’m not sure what your point is… It's still not ideal. Carlo can't just magic his way out every time The point is he turned out great for madrid. We literally just won the FA cup. What the fuck you on about?   Unless you consider the FA cup an insignificant title? OAP U21 players don't need to be registered in the squad. Did you even read the thread from my comments? Carlo begs to differ 🤨 Madrid will win the CL because of what you just said 🥲 [deleted] Ah yes the passionate cup that allegedly saved Ten Hags job, a very significant cup... Nice math bro, 62M EUR isn’t even 55M GBP 😂😂😂 But your initial point was bayern is fine letting de ligt go. Besides, 25 million at that point is as expensive comparatively to 50m now. Ornstein said it’s €70m"

I thought it would be something like €50m total including fees.  It seems bayern wants him off the book and he wants to restart somewhere else. Mean while the fee seems fair to what Bayern want.  I guess the only people not happy are the bayern fans, many I have seen are saying this is a massive loss. How has Tah been with Germany at the Euros? Gonna find my defensive line, gonna hold her strict, gonna grab some afternoon De Ligt. Insane downgrade for Bayern It‘s a mystery why he didn‘t work at Bayern and Juventus. He didn‘t even play badly at Bayern and undoubtfully is a leader. > Manchester United are very confident of finalizing a deal for Matthijs de Ligt this week, with the medical check taking place after the Euros. Talks between clubs are very constructive. Bayern want around €50m, while United's initial idea is about €40m. An agreement for €40m plus add-ons that take the total fee to €50m, and a sell-on clause, is not ruled out. The expectations of both clubs are getting closer. Max Eberl will push to finalize the sale, as Bayern need to generate funds for further signings. Selling De Ligt would be valuable to push ahead with the planned transfer of Jonathan Tah Man United getting De Ligt, Branthwaite and Kadigolu basically sets their back line for the foreseeable future. That would be a great start for Ten Hag's summer. I don't know a manager who goes so much for his soldiers as much as Ten Hag hunts for his 2019 Ajax  I wonder what's really happening with him, even Tuchel dropped him, his time at Juventus wasn't really great either even though he looked like he was going to have a great career when he show himself at Ajax. Just fyi but Christopher Michel is a really bad source, although a deal will go through Surprised no one else is going for this tbh What’s the catch? Surely other teams would be in for him at this price?   Or is he just not that good and it’s his name from Ajax days carrying him De Ligt is good but I feel like he's seriously overrated by Bayern's fanbase. Selling him is fine. The problem isn't getting rid of him, it's going for Tah as a replacement. Is branthwaite @ Everton as good or as high potential as people seem to suggest? If so, De Ligt + Branthwaite seems tidy business. Is he actually injury prone? I read that he was out repeatedly with a shoulder injury which is now fixed. Decent Maguire backup. Why do Bayern want Tah in place of De Ligt? Dutch United? How many more will come? :-) We're not even pretending that we still want to belong to the true elite anymore, are we? One of the most baffling premeditated downgrades I can recall. Why do Bayern want Tah in place of De Ligt? Unpopular opinion but Bayern r correct in selling him. He cannot stay fit & has high wages which is a perfect replacement for Varane & Phil Jones.  The only good thing i can think of is ETH has worked with him previously so he knows how to play to his strengths. Another injury prone player 👍 So half a mill a week for an average defender? Typical Utd, some things never change. Can’t tell what’s more wild, United seemingly getting a good player for a really good price or the fact that they’re only getting that price because he’s being forced out for Jonathan Tah of all people lol Start of the redemption arc He'll be on astronomical wages I imagine. You just wait till they get Frenkie for 13 mill Who can pay his wages? Are those clubs even interested in him? There's simply no competition for him right now. It's almost as if we might have a competent board room for a change.  A nice break from waiting until he's 35, putting him on Saudi Arabia wages and hope he's fit for at least 15 games. It's also Christopher Michel, who has 0 clue De Ligt my balls. It's both a loss and logical at the same time, if that makes sense  He's on high wages, has real injury concers and doesn't really fit the coach's vision. He is also the only real asset we can sell easily, and if  selling him means a window of Ito, Tah, Olise, Palhinha and Xavi (plus maybe Doué), it's an absolute nobrainer Tbh I think this is a win-win for everyone. I believe that Bayern should stick to 50€ + add ons but we will see, I believe even this would be a fair deal.  Bayern fans mostly sad because Matta is a lovable player, young and  people remember what happened with Kroos. But under the current circumstances   - United gets a good player for a fair amount of money,  - Bayern sells a player who earns a lot and wouldn’t be an undisputed starter + funding for additional transfers - Matta can prove himself at United under Ten Hag A lot of it depends on the final fee we end up paying for Tah, but with the amortisation of the transfer fees and reduction in salaries we'll save €8-15m this season and about €35m total over the next 3 seasons by swapping Tah for De Ligt.  Most of us disagree with it but it will give us a little extra money each year and get a huge contract off the books. I love how you are trying to remain logical while I'm marking out over here. Wanted him since before the Juve move. Good enough I’d say. Nothing outstanding and there have been some people calling for Schlotterbeck to replace him after his game against Denmark. Rüdiger was definitely Germany‘s best central defender but Tah didn’t leave anything to be desired in terms of defending I’d say. His biggest weakness seems to be his ball playing ability which is why some people preferred Schlotterbeck, especially after he had a great assist against Denmark. Good Not really. We get huge wages off the books and a player that is very injury prone and bad for a build-up style. I like him a lot, but its the logical step. Can't agree. He worked at Juventus. He was one of our best defenders. He wanted to leave for Bayern so the club sold him. Otherwise he would still be on Juve today I can almost guarantee it Injuries. Utd seem to have a kink for buying injury prone defenders. Branthwaite probably isnt happening unless united start to panic near the transfer deadline It never works out like that. Only like 50% of transfers actually turn out well. Who else other than fdj and de ligt Tbf, its only not really great if you look at it from the viewpoint that everyone thought his meteoric rise from Ajax would go on. At Juve he was a starter at Bayern also mostly, but plagued by injuries. Still the guy is only 24 and achieved quite a lot.  The question is if he can kick on to the next gear and can become undisputedly one of the world's best and I think him becoming more mature and getting rid of the occassional fuck is already a big step in that and not out of this realm to happen. > his time at Juventus wasn’t really great either   He’s loved in Turin though? His first season he had to adjust to a different defensive mindset (zonal vs man), but his second season he was argubly their best player. I feel like he was a little unlucky at Juventus, as they were on a downturn when he joined and he was just never going to be worth the fee they paid. At Bayern he had a very good first season, but struggled a little with injuries and again the club was in a bit of a downturn.  It's going to go one of two ways. Either he'll turn out to be a shrewd bit of business or United will end up with another injury-prone player on high wages. He fits a certain style of play, and will fit in very well next to Martinez who is more aggressive and faster and better in buildup, while de Ligt is more of a tank, and a leader ofc. De Ligt was all I had imagined and hoped Phil Jones would become, before the injury issues.   Ten Hag captained de Ligt at 18, so they both work well with each other.   Bayern want more money and want to get Tah from their league rivals after selling de Ligt. All their other assets are too old or too bad to get a good fee. He’s still good, there are multiple other important factors in a player’s transferability than just their skill  1. He only wants to start. 2. Most teams can’t afford the wages he wants. 3. Bayern are strapped for cash and want to get rid of his wages  There are only a few teams in world football that can fulfill all three of these conditions. And only Utd are in need of a starting level CB.  It’s luck of timing. Probably wants to work under ETH again. All of his former players seem to love him He's a niche sort of defender. He's reliable, a leader and a tackling monster. He's also not particularly fast or skilled in progressive buildup. The latter clashes with the vision of the football a lot of modern teams want to play. The catch is wages. Transfer fee is only part of the economics. Not many clubs could or would pay what De Ligt is on (about 300k per week) and a move to the EPL with Man Utd would probably see those even increase. Massive wages and a mixed bag of medical issues although majority short term injuries they typically tend to build up over time and hasn’t hit the heights expected at Ajax He doesn't want anyone but United so it prevents Bayern from turning this into an auction. That last one I agree he has been our best defender but I wouldn’t mind selling him for a suitable replacement. Instead they chose Tah who is pretty mid and it’s all based off one historic season with Leverkusen. The shoulder injuries were at Juventus. At Bayern Last season it was the knee injuries. Wages We conceded 30 goals in the 2nd half of the season with De Ligt as a starter, dont forget that. Hes a good player, but easily replaceable fits our team in terms of profile more. To weaken their Buli rival? Dunno this has to be an imposter, because we would’ve dropped a hundred million 40m is a good price regardless definitely will be on ridiculous wages though.   But what has happened to De Ligt that everyone ends up selling him? Well buying Tah also means weakening a direct rival There has to be a reason why managers/clubs don't rate De Ligt as highly as fans do. knowing United he is probably going to turn up and be proven at the end of his peak or ready for long term/ongoing injury. He hasn’t been great for a few years. His best season by a country mile was when he was still a teenager at Ajax. 0 improvement 2nd one for me. I think I read that when he was bought by Bayern as well... At United? You really think so or you just wish so? ...his redemption arc? He's been Bayerns best player, it's incredibly stupid of them to sell him. Their fanbase even started a petition, not because he's an icon or anything but just because it doesn't make any sense to sell him and getting Jonathan Tah as a replacement. If United buys him he'll be brilliant for them, 100%> Wont even be our highest paid, and he is suppossedly lowering his wages It was said that he was willing to lower his wages to join united Doubt it in ineos' united. Seems like we're trying to get hold of wages. Likely similar to Maguire id guess. Tbf Xavi would most likely be a loan with obligation so you pay the fee next season but with Olise (60), Ito (30), Palhinha (50) and Tah (probably 30-35) you'd be at around 170m€ this window alone which is nuts Well if he goes on to be injury free and regains his form we could just bought a CB for the next 10 years at high level for a decent price. He is not funding all that. In terms of real money, it's 40 million and about 15m in wages this year. In terms of accounting, he does not give that much of a profit either because you just bought him 2 years ago. Only his wages of 15m will be freed up. Why won't he be an undisputed starter at Bayern? > Bayern should stick to 50€ + add ons but we will see, I believe even this would be a fair deal.  As I said I don't think it will be that, reports saying €51m with add ons included now. I don't think Bayern want United to walk away now that they want income to buy other players. Plus the player wants to leave. > 50€ + add ons   I think the final price would be 50m including all addons  50+ addons is just too expensive Tah is certainly a better LCB than Schlotti tho; his ability on the ball imo is underrated as he's got a very strong left foot and is comfortable with long passes More like mediocre. Wasnt it more like Juve desperately needed the money at the time so they were very happy to oblige Wages and injuries for Bayern, just wages at Juve. I doubt the whole young captain thing matters too much but he's fine, wages are concern numero uno. it will happen once we sell Greenwood,we'll defo put in a final bid I think it's smoke and mirrors to let Bayern know we haven't thrown all our eggs in the De Ligt basket. We will walk if they push the price too high. After ten years we've finally learnt saying ""we've got loads of money and this is the only guy we want"" is not a viable negotiation strategy. Onana was still there in 2019. VdB was there too but he was bought under Ole and isn't exactly high on ten Hag's teamsheet at the moment. Licha and Antony were post-2019. He used to be, until he made some low key disparaging comments about the club.   Nevertheless, he was class after his first season, apart from some unfortunate handballs. Many fans, me included, thought that the fee Bayern paid was too low. In hindsight, might've been a good move. > Bayern are strapped for cash and want to get rid of his wages  We arent strapped for crash, but Bayern wants to completly restructure the entire wage pyramid etc. Ajax he played in were  more progressive than Bayern, so it's myth that he's bad at progression. He's a proper old school cb which United need to replace varane. Bayern have relied on him to be the ball playing CB this season, its not his strongest point, but he's not bad at it. Beside a player like Martinez he will look way better vs Upa/Kim who are both even worse at build-up. Dismantling the team that didn't lose all season in the Bundesliga is realistically a concern. Even best defender is debatable. He's perfect for a more defensive and conservative approach like Tuchel adopted in the CL but he has limitations in his game Wages In keeping with their new policy of signing PL dross, we'll find out Bayern's new CEO is Ed Woodward. maybe the article is wrong and its actually FC United of Manchester? He was Bayern's record transfer iirc. Juve wasn't kicking him out he might be an injury prone player now He didn’t impress as expected at Bayern. He didn’t impress as expected at Bayern. Replacing de Ligt with Tah also means weakening yourself de Ligt is better though weakening another rival, by weakening yourself? Wait, now Leverkusen is a direct rival? I'm having trouble keeping up with all of them.   This is the first Leverkusen player we've bought in ages and we would have gotten rinsed on here for waiting to sign him on a free next year which was 100% a possibility. He missed 20 games for club and country last season and always needed a few games to get back to 100% afterwards. Combine that with his high wages and the fact that he isn’t a [homegrown player.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homegrown_Player_Rule_(UEFA)) He's also been kind of injury prone lately. I'd still rather have him over Tah at Bayern but de Ligt is definitely not as incredible as Reddit makes him out to be. He has a lot of difficulties ""defending spaces"". He's a great 1v1 defender but Kim and even Upamecano are better at distribution and actually keeping spaces tight. The latter just fucks up too often lol. I meant Man U redemption arc why are people forgetting that he was an absolute rock at Juve? He went for 70m(?) to Bayern cos he was trending towards world class, not cos Bayern pitied him Not being United's highest paid doesn't mean it's not a high number. Haven't they got players on over £300k a week? You don't benchmark a bad salary structure.  You benchmark with what the rival teams are paying players in similar position.  Anything over 250k a week is too much.   No justification to pay him more than what City Liverpool and Arsenal pay their top CB's - Dias Stones Van Djik. 280,000 a week De Ligt, Tillman and Zirkzee bring down the net spent to ~100m. Still a lot but considering the fact that Bayern usually has a net spent of roughly 50m every year and that they had a net spent of only 15m last year, it's not that much over a two year period. If they sell another one (Coman for 35-40?) they might not even be that far off the average spending while at the same time reducing the wage bill step by stept And all in the hand of just relegated manager Kompany Hopefully selling Kimmich as well, maybe Coman if possible Which is what we thought and Juve fans thought too when he was brought in. I really hope he finds his place now Well yeah. If everything goes perfectly every player is a gem. We thought the same when we got him from Juve and now we are offloading him to you.  I hope it works out for him, cause he is such a nice guy, but always anticipating the best is not the best planning policy And United's defensive signings have such a history of being injury free. Kompany doesnt seem to care much whether he stays or not and Bayern already signed Ito so its a lot of competition. Other CBs are a bit better on the ball and not as slow so they might fit Kompany's system better They have a wide range of CBs, Upa, Dier, Kim, Stanisic and few youngsters.    It's like us with Rudiger, even though he should be after the amazing season he's had, idk if he will be the undisputed starter at Madrid. bit of both, we cant say no to a fucking plusvalenza  He also left ""to play in champions league"" so thats sorta rich in hindsight. Don't see us going any higher than 50mill tbh. If they reject I think we walk. Even if it's just to set an example for future bids. We been taken the piss out of the last however many years. I don’t think our top price reaches evertons bottom. You really don’t think Everton are gonna pull a Leicester and force United to pay £80 million like they did with Slab head? Like why would they sell him when they don’t need to… Especially after they escaped PSR barely lol United are definitely aiming for 2 centerbacks this season though. Thats been the plan So Onana Gotcha, yeah that’s a more accurate description He bulked up a fair bit after leaving Ajax and seems to have lot a bit of his progressive skills/hasnt used them much He was never the ball playing CB for us. In his first season it was Upamecano (who is an excellent buildup player btw) and in his second it was always one of Dier/Kim/Upamecano. Ed was actually a commercial genius, just dont put him in football side. TIL Olise and Palhinha are PL dross. Sure, but Bayern also paid essentially the same as Juve did for him originally. That was Lucas Hernandez. Not De Ligt. Then he’ll fit right in He was basically their player of the season in his first year. Second season he was riddled with injuries which is bad luck. *happy Dortmund noises*  But like seriously, I don't understand it. Kompany has like 2 games where he played with a 3/5 ATB in 2 years. It's mostly 4-2-3-1 in the Championship and 4-4-2 in the Prem (at least according to transfermarkt).  So Tah is either very confident he's gonna bench one of Kim Min Jae/Upamecano or he's just gonna ride the bench himself.  Like unless he's getting a massive pay upgrade, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense for him to leave for Bayern.  They are making Leverkusen weaker WHILE making themselves weaker. People are seriously underestimating Tah.  He has shown his leadership skills, is way more rapid and had an outstanding season.    De Ligt may have a higher ceiling and I think he's a fantastic player, but Bayern is getting a player that suits their proposed play style a bit more for a noticeably cheaper package. They should have enough to win the league anyway, they were just outclassed. Hamstring the opponent and they're walking the league again Did you not watch football last season? Juve just thought his wages were too high as well. Tah was similar to de ligt in the sense he was somewhat of a prodigy on a downward trajectory. People are only rating de ligt higher because of his potential in my opinion and he still has time to turn it around but tah seems to be finally hitting his so he’s definitely better right now [deleted] Only Casemiro and we are looking to sell him. Our revenue wage ratio is also one of the best in the league. The reason we have the reputation of overpaying players is they are shit for what they earn, not that we are overbudget Van dijk and Dias went for 70m. The reason de ligt is 40m is because of his wages. So de ligt is still cheaper overall. I'm not saying he's at the level of van dijk btw Need to wait for final numbers, but his rumored wages after his wage cut is 12M Euros per year, which is 230k Euros or 195k pounds per week. That puts him around the same as other clubs top earning CBs - Maguire, Saliba, Fofana and less than VVD, Stones. Well if he is lowering his wage from what he gets at Bayern Munich (a similar team to Man United) then it must be a good wage Pounds or euros? And we save like 100k a week from varane to de ligt then Why would u want to sell Kimmich??? Lend us your steroid doctor. Ito is great with the ball and very consistent, Bayern won't miss any CB they are stacked there if they get Tah. Min-Jae looked tired after the AFC though. Eh I'm pretty sure militao or alava have lost their place.  More likely militao than alaba is benched New board. They should look to send a message by not meeting that crazy fee As I say I don't believe it really is. It's definitely been what we've been saying, but I think it's a tactic. De Ligt is coming in to start, not to be 3rd choice to two other 60m defenders in Branthwaite and Martinez. I think we're pushing the narrative for the reasons I outlined in my first post. Only way I see us signing a second is if West Ham or whoever gives us decent money for Maguire.   I guess neither of us will know until the window closes. All washed Dier/Kim/Upamecano are all worse with the ball than De Ligt. This season when playing (and he's usually played with Dier) he's been the primary CB with responsibility for the ball, the only thing he isn't responsible for in the build up is long balls, he doesn't try that pass very often.   Upa and Kim have both preformed worse than Dier and De Ligt this season. Kim has never been a good passer and Upa has too many big mistakes in him.  De Ligt is a reliable passer, good touch, safe and snappy.   All the stats, the eye test, and the coaches words all back up what I'm saying. It's not very controversial and is a big issue in Bayerns defence, the fact that they have no ball playing CB. And also why they're not fussed about selling one of them.   Dier/Kim/Upamecano/De Ligt all have similar enough (read - not great) ability in the build-up but De Ligt is the best of that bunch. Its not saying too much to be fair, but once that responsibility is lifted, I expect him to play with much more freedom. People say this, but he did absolutely nothing incredible from a commercial perspective.   The sponsorships, etc. for the most part have been below or at the market value we had always previously had.   The team viewer deal for example was worth just under £50m per season for 5 years. £17m less than the deal agreed with Chevrolet in 2012.   The new snapdragon deal is roughly worth £75m.    Defenders don't get sold for a lot. And the usually conservative Bayern shelling out that much means a lot. His book value at the time of would've been 27mil and Juve banked a 40 mil profit. All because Allegri had different ideas. Don’t forget Dier who was a starter for most of the time last season. He was really good its pretty much guaranteed that Tah is getting a massive pay upgrade. on the other hand bayern is paying Tah significantly less than de ligt. most of bayerns top earners are up for sale.   a) de ligt   b) goretzka   c) kimmich   d) gnabry   e) coman   top earners not for sale: müller, neuer and kane.    not sure about Sane, not much news about him.   also Musiala earned himself a contract in that category.    its absolutely unheard of that bayern tries to offload that many top earners/players from the first team. for like 9 years i hear people talking about an ""umbruch"" (big change) in bayerns first team. but it was always just small changes on a year to year basis. but this year it seems to actually happen. will be interesting to see how many players aside from de ligt will be sold. Goretzka, Gnabry and Coman are IMO on such big contracts bayern has to gift them away to get rid of them. similar to how de ligt costs ""only"" 40m because he has those ridiculous Mino raiola wages. there is a market for Kimmich but he has only one year on his contract. bayern is seriously stuck with players they want to get rid of He suits Bayern better, I agree. But on pure skill de Ligt is better than Tah IMO I missed the entire season. What happened?  We are giving them their 3rd highest transfer fee ever and a record fee for a defender. And he has 1 year left on his contract. We could have unsettled the shit out of him, not signed him and then gotten his signature on January 1 which would have caused huge issues for their squad.  People on this sub act like no other clubs buy players domestically. No like, this is such a smart signing this signals the start of a new era. Plus if you take a look at United’s back 4 this season adding de ligt might actually look like a miracle >start of he's a step towards fixing the problems though Including bonuses Sancho and Rashford are on similar wages right? Rashford is on £300k+ a week before bonuses I am pretty sure. Sancho, who everyone will point to, is not. He's on £250k You’re probably not going to sell Casemiro, unless he’s off to Saudi. This will probably end in a mutual buyout. The problem with high wages is that they make players difficult to offload if they don't work out for one reason or another, which United have struggled with numerous times.  If de Ligt doesn't work out at United and is earning £250k+ per week, who are you realistically going to be able to sell him to? De ligt also no where near the level of those two players hence the fee.  Also Van Djik & Dias were on much lower wages when they first signed. Only their contract extension got them to their current wages VVD was signed for 75m with a 6 year contract on 120k per week. The total cost to Liverpool of the first contract and deal was 112m. De Ligt will be paid around 300k per week assuming his Bayern wages are roughly matched, so assuming a 6 year contract and 40m fee, the total cost would be 134m. Given a bit of transfer inflation in the last 7 years, he's probably a bit cheaper when all is said and done. But make no mistake, Man Utd are paying world class money for a player that was seen as a rotation option for Erik Dier last season. 20m/y bit much. I'd play both Stani and Pavlo over him, so that's a bit steep for a backup We would, but the chance a piece of Old Trafford falls on him and kills him is too high. I agree with you partly. I think the choice was always between De ligt or Branthwaite and then an additional other centerback to play backup. Maybe but if we sign another CB we don't need to sign a left back because we have Martinez that can cover there. We've lost one CB already and there's talk of selling Lindelof or Maguire, and I'm not sure if Evans will be around next season but he's old af too.  We had Casemiro at CB a lot last year 3 starting CBs is not too much imo.. Branthwaite will be the one who waits though.. and being the youngest not sure it's best for him Not as washed as Szoblai, darwin and Gakpo > Upamecano are all worse with the ball than De Ligt.  This is said by someone who's seen a few high profile mistakes on the ball and doesn't actually watch the player. Upamecano is clearly a better progresser of the the ball if you actually watch him. You must be smoking crack if you think De Ligt is better than Upa or Dier on the ball. Hell, the entire reason Upa keeps playing for Bayern and France despite his mistakes is because he's really good at passing That Chevrolet deal was insane.  They got completely hosed. degree wrong hat waiting liquid bake unite selective aspiring profit   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Chevrolet had a much wider sponsorship deal. They were also paying for being our main auto manufacturer sponsor.  Teamviewer was still a record shirt sponsor deal.  I still agree with you on Woodward not being that impressive on the commercial side. What does Allegri have to do with that? De Ligt wanted to leave and we weren't concerned as we would just use the money to sign Bremer. Sane and Kimmich are both not for sale if they reduce their wages. Otherwise, they are up for sale I really think this proposed swap is almost 100% speed based. I think the board is tired of trotting out cargo ship CBs and getting rinsed because of it at the back. Debatable Can't agree. De Ligt needs to perform for a while before we make these claims. >then gotten his signature on January 1 which would have caused huge issues for  Wrong. Pre contract agreements can't be signed with players that play in the same league.   ""Officially"", you wouldn't be speaking with him until 1 month before his contract expired (season already over at that point)  Ultimately you may have a point, but it's whether Leverkusen value keeping him for a season or ""strengthening"" a direct rival whilst weakening themselves on the back of a title winning season. Very likely but they are not hitting those bonuses I can guarantee that Then we'll rather keep him if we have to pay him anyway. He's still serviceable especially if he doesn't need to play much. Yes, the links are indeed to Saudi None which is why it's a risk. Every option has their own risk though. Other options are more expensive in terms of transfer fees That just means you'll have to sell him cheaply too, so that the next team can afford his wages. Sweet deal for De Ligt. De ligt is more proven and definitely as good as Dias was when he left Benfica. He just earns much more. When I checked he was on 180k per week when he transfered. Also, he signed an extension midway through his contract Crack epidemic peaked 35 years ago, how are you still on that stuff? all that for the ugliest logo of all time kimmich complained about a lack of appreciation, especially in regards to his covid drama. during the past years ""lack of appreciation"" is code for ""pay up or i run down the contract"". both players are rather valuable and have only one year on their contract left. it would be absolutely crazy if bayern lost Sane, Kimmich and Davies all on a free (plus Müller and Neuer maybe ending their careers). im really looking forward to see what bayern is up to in the next two transfer perioids. most definitely bigger changes than what we've seen in a long time And Tah shouldn't? This is probably his second good season. De Ligt was very good in his first season in Bayern and definitely better than Tah during his Juve stint Tah only has one season It doesn't matter whether we agree to terms now or next season. He'd be coming to Bayern and would spend the entirety of next season fielding questions about coming here.  That's beside the point though - people who don't watch or pay attention to our league are so high and mighty about how we conduct business. We're paying them a record fee for a defender.   Let's not act like Leicester, Southampton, Brighton weren't ripped down to their foundation domestically after they had success. And everyone is on a 25% drop when we're not in the CL, so it's pretty much a guarantee nobody is earning more than 300k currently. If by serviceable, you mean giving the opposition express service into the box [deleted] Oh yeah I completely agree. I don't think it's a bad signing at all and at that transfer fee it's worth the risk, even if United are going to have to overpay in terms of wages. Hence Dias was paid only 70k back then. After his contract extension, he still earns under 200k a week.  Don't see what De Ligt has achieved to get significantly more than that. More than 250k for De Ligt is simply not worth it from Man Utd pov. Nope, £120k, as reported widely at the time. £180k might be including the bonuses for winning CL or something, but it would have made him the highest paid player in the squad at the time, which would be weird for a new player arriving from Southampton.     > Also, he signed an extension midway through his contract     Should we factor in a pay rise for De Ligt in 3 years too? Not sure what the point is here really. You can only work with like-for-like when discussing transfers. Signing extensions just means the remainder of the initial fee can re-amortised across the length of the deal, making the player cheaper for the club vs operational expenses. Ha ha >kimmich complained about a lack of appreciation, especially in regards to his covid drama.  No he didn't. He did like 3 years ago. He already commented on this and called it all bullshit.  >Sane, Kimmich and Davies all on a free  Again, we won't. Either they accept reduced wages (except Davies who will get a slight wage increase), or get sold even if we sell them for below market value. You’d certainly know all about people being high and mighty. Casemiro is not that bad, You lots like to shit on United players as a fun. Casemiro is not that bad, You lots like to shit on United players as a fun The hypothetical was we will buy out his contract so we were basically going to pay him anyway. My first comment in this chain is to sell him I'm talking about actual money. He was only on that 120k for 3-4 years then they had to pay him 250 after that. Besides, you can't amortised beyond 5 years What are you guys even mad about I'm so confused. We're paying way too much money for a player who is not worth it, but because he's in the same league as us thats an issue?  Besides, Tah is german, 28 years old, and will get paid far better in Bayern. No shit he'd like to play for us. Also, it seems like it's guaranteed he'll be playing for us either this year or next on a free so whats the issue. I really don't understand 'Twas a joke, but yes he was bad this year"

I rather have us buy a hot prospect (18-22 of age) especially since we already have 5-6 players for CBs (De Ligt excluded)...  Damn, I already miss De Ligt and he's not even sold yet. 😭 Clear agreement was reached regarding transfer fees and bonuses Bayern agree with Bayer 04: Tah deal only depends on this point Bayer 04 Leverkusen  Breakthrough in transfer poker for national player Jonathan Tah. Bayern Munich and Bayer 04 have fundamentally agreed on the transfer terms for Leverkusen's defense chief. But the deal is not yet perfect.      For a long time it was not clear how Bayern Munich and the German double winner Leverkusen would come together in the transfer deal for Leverkusen's defense chief Jonathan Tah. The first two offers from Munich, which were 18 million euros plus two million in bonuses and 20 million plus five million in bonuses, did not represent a real basis for negotiations for those responsible at Bayer 04.      But now there has been a decisive step in the talks between the two clubs: According to kicker information, they have reached a clear agreement regarding the transfer fee and the additional bonuses. These are in the range of around 25 million euros in fixed transfer compensation and around five million in performance-related additional payments.   Everything depends on de Ligt and Manchester United      But the deal is not yet perfect. The Munich team are only prepared to buy out Tah, who does not want to extend his stay in Leverkusen, out of his contract, which runs until 2025, for this sum if Bayern central defender Matthijs de Ligt has been sold.      In the negotiations with the Red Devils, Bayern are still demanding a package of 50 million euros for the Dutch international. Manchester United, whose team manager Erik ten Hag trained defender de Ligt when they were together at Ajax Amsterdam, and the Munich team are said to still be a long way apart when it comes to their transfer expectations.   Infobox      If FC Bayern and Man United reach an agreement, nothing will stand in the way of Tah moving to Munich. With the 28-year-old, Bayern have had clarity about a working paper with the record champions for weeks. Now everything depends on De Ligt. Bayer 04 should now also step up their efforts to find a new central defender, which would be absolutely necessary after Tah's departure. And our buying MdL depends on our selling Wan Bissaka to West Ham, supposedly. I kinda hope West Ham can't buy AWB unless they sell someone to some random club too, just to see how long this chain can go. Now it's just adding insult to injury.  Selling De Ligt below value, overpaying for Tah who is in the last year of his contract, all to end up with a defence worse than last year. You know after seeing the first Kompany games I'm in, Tah is fitting for that. I don’t get it why we are so persistent to sign Tah but I hope that at least means the Doue transfer will get approved by the supervisory board when we sell De Ligt and Mazraoui [deleted] United should just cut out the middle man and buy Tah This signing is to reduce wages and weaken their opponents. I don’t think Tah is going to be amazing, but it’s an understandable signing. Hinges on bayern accepting the offer United should stand their ground and not overpay for De Ligt. His wages are big and he can't be that good if Bayern are willing to sell You trade a better, more expensive center back for a cheaper but still good center back. If that's what Bayern needs right now, go for it. I’ll never understand why German teams are willing to sell their best players to the strongest team in the league. The saga is finally ending Jonathan Tah is WWE Champion? Is Tah entering the last year of his contract?   This looks like a great price for the player. Why don’t we buy Tah for 35? So you're saying United hold all the cards in that negotiation now? Insert Thanos Meme Just shows how little I seem to know about soccer  If you had asked me I'd say that the combo De Light and Dier was the best look we had in the centre in the end...  And now if shit hits the fan and the #1 line up gets injured we still have to fall back to Upamecano, the red card magnet and Kim, the guy that's more injured than the entire team of Vfb Stuttgart combined...  Fuck me That's not a smart move for Bayern, a step back for de Ligt and a lose for Leverkusen.   The only winner I could see is Tah but only if Bayern outperforms Leverkusen this season.  If not this is an rare lose-lose transfer. We're looking to trim our wage bill and overall costs. If we can sell De Ligt for €55m and swap him for Tah, we'll save ≈€16m per season for the next 3, plus an immediate profit of ≈€7m from the sale (according to Chat GPT). That is a substantial amount of money.  Regardless of how we feel about this, it makes sense financially. Tah is worth double that surely? We are overpaying. >I'm not smart enough to see Tah being a great transfer for Bayern.  Fast, german, almost no mistakes in buildup, cheaper fee, cheaper wages, leadership (was one of the captains of Leverkusen).  >I rather have us buy a hot prospect (18-22 of age)   Our age profile really doesnt support going for a hot prospect imo, plenty mid-20s. Only a top youth prospect like Yoro would have been worth it, but that comes with a much bigger fee, negating the upside of the Tah transfer.  >we already have 5-6 players for CBs (De Ligt excluded)  We have Upa, Kim and Dier, with Ito and Stanisic covering both FB and CB, especially with Maz leaving. I dont even know who the supposed 6th CB is. But he was important to Leverkusen so at least you get to buy out your competition again. I dont really see a benefit for Bayern except in hurting Leverkusen. Tah is irreplacable for them as a leader and as an experienced defender.  Fluent in 3 languages and very influential in the dressing room.   This looks a lot like the bayern of old, who try to hurt their main competitors. he wont be sold if the only ones interested and capable are us, dont worry. we need to sell Bissaka Lindelof and Mctominay. We SHOULD have sold Casemiro and Eriksen by now. We SHOULD have binned and paid off Malacia. We SHOULD find all the shamans and witch doctors on the planet and conjure up some way to get rid of Antony and we ve done nothing yet.   we re not signing anybody else. You guys overrate De Ligt so much, he's not even that good ""defense chief"" sounds like he works for the police, ""the chief of ministry of defense"" It's turtles all the way down. Classic transfer merry-go-round >And our buying MdL depends on our selling Wan Bissaka to West Ham,  I thought buying Mazraoui depended on selling Wan Bissaka. If AWB leaves, we also have to get a new RB. Ah, the ole Reddit [chain-a-roo](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/s/XJjGOcFKqt) Reminds me of the Giroud-Aubameyang-Batshuayi merry go round in 2018 It's odd because that's exactly what we used to do instead The market sets the value. Who is going to pay De Ligt's wages and 70-80m to Bayern? I think 55m is a fair evaluation since Bayern wants to sell and there don't seem to be many teams lined up to bid. 25m is not overpaying for tah, thats 5m below market value depending on the reqs for the add-ons. If it wasnt the last year of his contract you wouldnt be getting him for this price in the first place. > all to end up with a defence worse than last year.  That is definitely not true.   Ito is so insanely much better than Davies defensively and so is Stani compared to Kimmich. In addition to that we have Palhinha now in front of our defense. Not saying Tah is better than de Ligt by any means but our defense will definitely be better next season than last season, whether Tah or de Ligt plays. Well, that's what happens when you sign Kane. Guy got too much spurs-energy in him You're overestimating De Ligt's value and the defense isn't worst than last year.  Some fans are so in love with De Ligt, they're underrating Tah. I'd have preferred a younger CB but to argue he's worst than De Ligt is just silly Is 25mil overpaying tho?  How much did we get for süle? Couldnt  watch the games, could you explain a little? How was Palhinha and Kimmich? >when we sell De Ligt and Mazraoui  That's if United can HURRY THE FUCK UP Doué would be a perfect transfer for Leverkusen (apart from the financial side). Use the Tah money (and Hlozek hopefully) and some to build him up as a succesor to wirtz. Honestly Olise alone is such a bargain for you. He will destroy your league I think especially with Musiala and Kane alongside him. Your attack is really solid. You are severely underestimating Eberl and his squad planning if you think these are the only reasons for the transfer. Haz leverkusen made any signings yet? All these links to either tah or frimpong leaving earlier on was strange but understandable. Frimpong i dont see rumors or leaving he seems the type to want to stay and building smth. Tah idk much about but hes close with wirtz they were on vacay together it seems. But if it's a loss for leverkusen it's a smart move? There’s no way United pay €55m Nope, this is pretty much his current market value. The same Jonathan Tah that has a year left on his contract and a 18m release clause that wasn't triggered last summer? Things work differently outside the Premier League. > We have Upa, Kim and Dier, with Ito and Stanisic covering both FB and CB, especially with Maz leaving. I dont even know who the supposed 6th CB is.  Buchmann maybe lol  I do agree, tho, especially after seeing the first game I more and more understand why Kompany doesn't see de Ligt as the ideal fit for his philosophy Tah makes no mistakes in buildup is wrong, he does make minor gaffes and those were sometimes visible even last season despite being in a back 3.  He will be more exposed in a back 4 and remember, he didn't start playing only last season, he was far more inconsistent before. Tarek Buchmann is a real talent, if he can stay healthy he ought to take some playtime.  Staniṣ̌ić gotta play much more after his great season with Leverkusen.  Kimmich wants to always play and he will not be playing in the midfield every game since there's so much competition there. If we sell Davies we will most likely buy another LB.  Ito injured till nov/dec, Stani, Dier, Upa, Kim and Buchmann (back from injury soon) are plenty of players to cover CBs. I rather have Hummels for 1-2 seasons than Tah. Both want to start obviously but Hummels will learn soon enough that his body can't really handle 90mins every game anymore.  *Edit, I think we need a prospect if Upa or Kim fail to establish themselves for the long run (next 4-6 years). We are actually helping Leverkusen since they don't want to lose Tah on a free next year. Hopefully someone gazumps us on this one. He is a german national and right now part of the german CB pair that is probably set by Nagelsmann. I dont understand how people dont understand why Bayern is going for him especially when his contract runs out. He has been our best defender since he joined us for 2 seasons ago. Only that he was injured for a couple of months this past season! The chain might lead to someone selling to Saudi Arabia for above market value just so they can buy the same profile younger player for half the price. Human Centipede. MDL is varane replacement Mazraoui AWB replacement I haven't seen one of these in years. I'm going in Did we? We never sold a good enough player for United in the past 10 years I think? If we exclude Lukaku and Di Maria, who weren't undervalue when we sold them imo. We don’t want to pay €55m euro with the wages I believe.  Our offer was in the region of £35m which is around €41m euros. And we wanted to pay about €15m for Mazraoui ""It makes sense for them to sell extremely under value and provide an inferior replacement because they want to"" Ito broke his foot and won’t play for you for ages Tah had the first season of his career where he performed played better than De Ligt. This is because De Ligt had injury issues in the first half and it took until the Dier transfer to find an appropriate partner.  De Ligt remains younger, more of a leader on the pitch, and has similar limitations to Tah while being more physical and better in the air. Tah has not shown he is top-tier outside a back-three, and at the Euros, Germany was better when Schlotterbeck was playing.  What you call 'silly' is mainstream opinion, not just among Bayern fans. Watch them perform a 360 when the Tah transfer turns out to be tactically fit to what Bayern needs. Some of these people just love to reiterate the popular opinions while completely ignoring the fact that people in charge at the club  might actually know a bit more than them. It's absolutely not. It's pretty much exactly what he is currently worth. Yall can totally argue whether the whole -de ligt + tah thing youre doing makes sense in the first place, but the price for tah is perfectly fine. Kimmich was insane. Paired up next to Pavlovic in a more advanced role and finally looked like the creating and passing monster we are used to.  My point rather is that we also played a highline and our CBs had to make progressive/line breaking passes, which are 2 of the things Tah is comfortably better at. It's not us Bayern reject a agreement everyone thought was fine. Bayern rejected our bid which was a surprise to the players involved and us. Clearly Bayern have upped their price because of Yoro. Not our fault dimwit. Our attack was solid last season too the main problem we had to solve this window was defence and I don't think Tha's signing will help much with that especially after itos broken leg They signed Terrier and Belocian from Rennes, and Aleix Garcia from Girona. The rumours about who will replace Tah are currently mostly Matip, Hummels was in the discussion prior as well For center back it seems only Belocian (https://www.transfermarkt.de/jeanuel-belocian/profil/spieler/919515).   But I do not know how they plan with him. Edit: they might get Matip as well, but that is a rumour only yet I don’t really think it’s a huge loss for Leverkusen. I would even go as far and say that Tapsoba and Koussonu are more important for the way Alonso wants to play. And they still have Hincapie Bayern say they want 50m fixed, maybe they won't get that but a 55m package is conceivable Maybe not €55m up front, but we want at least €50m before add ons and don't need to sell. United also just paid almost €70m for a 18 year old which makes their position difficult. Buchmann is more than just a question mark, he was injured for basically his entire time with the pros, wish the best for him but highly doubt his body is made for professional football. And why is that?  Genuinely curious not trying to be facetious I wrote almost no mistakes, which is supported by both the stats and the eye test imo. We may also play 3atb, and even if not he will have Palhinha by his side. Buchmann has barely played for 1 1/2 years. Stanisic will find his minutes in the line. We may also play a 3atb. And there is a reason Hummels wasn't part of the national team while Tah was, and that is that you can't  push the line forward if you depend on him for recovery speed. Getting Hummels means being bound to low or mid block football, just for one aging player. Tbh not so sure about that. This the last alonso year and the same goes for a lot of players on that team. No matter what happens after that, it will be worse. That means this season is their best shot to be as successful as they can be, losing their captain and leader in defense to Bayern, is certainly a decision. Also they will be swimming in money come next summer, so I’m not sure how much they benefit from this fee (to add they’re Bayer, they don’t really *need* money like other clubs do) because for me De Ligt is the better and younger player. It is out of question that Tah would be a decent addition to Bayern, but it IS a question wether the entire trade objectively benefits them. Casemiro: ""Someone called me?"" >MDL is varane replacement Mazraoui AWB replacement  So? Selling Wan Bissaka and signing De Ligt still have nothing to do with one another Selling Fred, getting Amrabat on loan Good point actually, those greedy bastards. Thats the spin their agent is putting on it, without Ornstein giving out any actual numbers. Don’t you think it’s odd that report didn’t mention any numbers? >Clearly Bayern have upped their price because of Yoro.  How do you know that when the report mentions no price None of those 3 is playing the role that Tah played in the middle of the 3atb. Andrich did that when Tah didnt play. Probably because of his speed. Kompany plays very high line and De Ligt is not that fast. Hummels would be a depth player and he has shown that he still has some lovely through balls. He's class and dominant in positioning and can clearly play next to decently fast CB.  When Ito's healthy I can see him and Upa/Kim play alot. Tah would want a 4-5 years contract at 10-12m/y... that's really risky. I know he's only 28 but he has ""only"" had one awesome season under his belt thus far, he has been a little too shaky these past years. Hopefully he stays great the next 4-5 years then🙏 See I get the argument that De Ligt is better as a player than Tah but I think De Ligt shouldnt be seen as a transfer that is made because of Bayern wanting Tah. It seems they want to restructure the team and wages and I imagine there are intern reasons why Bayern wants to sell De Ligt we arent aware of (for example his injury proneness and the assessment that Bayern needs a CB pair that can play a lot of games together to give the team a better defense )  No matter what the Tah transfer is reasonable and smart. He was consistently one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga while our back 4 changed every game. I think that is something the board and Eberl are thinking about. I never said the sales were related. We didnt sell fred to get amrabat. We sold fred because he wasnt good enough and got amrabat a while after People know you guys overpay, so… No numbers from Plettenberg or other Bayern media either Whitwell, our tier 1 has said as much. Doesn't take a genius to put 2 and 2 together I know. My point was replacing Tah is easier than replacing the other two because there are much more involved. Tah sure is a long serving player for them, but his „role“ or profile is much easier to replace. Matip for example would probably fit right into that role Nagelsmann disagreed, a depth player shouldn't dictate the style of play, and I doubt Tah comes in as depth player anyway when Kim is clearly seen as right sided CB by Kompany and we are targeting Tah for his ability to play on the left. So what were you trying to say?  The correlation between Mazraoui being AWB's replacement was already implied in my original comment. Sold CDM cover and bought CDM cover.   The effect of Fred leaving was seen in how many more shots were conceded, compared to the previous season. It doesn't seem that the new regime is prepared to overpay at all But those didn't say that United made offers satisfying Bayerns demands. Then why not mention the fee? Maybe they paid what they ""thought"" Bayern wanted, according to german media Bayern wants a 70m package, which is consistent with what they said from the beginning, for De Ligt they want 50m and 20m for Maz, I don't see why the Yoro transfer would change that. considering man united transfer history, it is indeed easy to put 2+2 together lmao I dont know, it feels like you find those mixtures of CB/FB who can make progressive runs by the boatload by now. Dortmund did pretty good last season without playing lowblock most of their games.😉 But yeah, Tah will be our LCB. A role that Ito, Stani and Upa do play on as well. Better to spend that kind of money on LB since Rapha's made of glass. Fred wasn’t ever a DM. And we sold him because he was in his 30s and in the last year of his contract. You might have a point if the same team were in charge of transfers this summer...but they aren't. The profile is definitely more common these days. But its still a position/role that needs good players on that level and those aren’t cheap. And in that particular case, from what it seems they already have Matip lined up as a replacement Have you not seen their CL run consisting of sitting deep and then sending Adeyemi in the counter? And we specifically want a LCB, you can throw some names around all you want, we were always going for one to replace de Ligt as that is what Kompany apparently needs. But he sure did play as the DM when casemiro wasn't on the pitch.    I didn't say anything about why he was sold. Just that he was sold. Those are cheap though? Just look at the prices Bayer paid for Koussonou, Tapsoba and Hincapie in the first place, they already got their next one as well in Belocian. Bayern bought Ito for 23m€. Even the hot prospect in that role currently, Calafiori, went for just 40m€. That's a bit harsh mate, against ""bigger"" teams yes. They usually sit deep against us as well. I know I'm a bit biased for Hummels, and I don't claim to know much but we want to save money. Getting Tah isn't a safe bet in doing that... there are better options for LCB if you only want to view it from a narrow angle. No, he never played as a DM. He played in a double pivot alongside McTominay. Both as Cm with Bruno as an AM. McTominay covered the man, Fred covered the space. Both players alternated in who supported the attack and who stayed back closer to the halfway line. „Cheap“ in comparison to today’s market prices sure, but looking at it in a different context i would say most Clubs in the Bundesliga couldn’t or won’t pay above 20 Million + the salary for young talented Defenders lile Tapsoba or Koussonu for example. I would even say that Koussonu had a „bad“ start in Leverkusen and looked not really convincing. But they can pay these prices, deal with transfer losses easier than other clubs. Hincapie obviously was a really good find for that price. And we don't want to sit deep in any case. That's why Nagelsmann didn't take him to the Euros, that's why we aren't going for Hummels.  Then show me those better options at LCB that are equally as cheap and with similar upsides (fast, very secure short passing, leader figure). Fred covered the space while positioned as the deeper player. You're just using a low of words to say nothing different. Fred's role was primarily to stop the opposition, so he was a DM. Not a CM Why does it matter if most in the Bundesliga can't, when Bayer is one of those that can? For a club of their size this profile in good quality is affordable. Wasn't Ito supposed to be your new LCB? Your reading comprehension needs work. Fred alternated with McTominay in who stayed deeper, but he was never a pure DM. He didn't sit ahead of the backline to cover space, he roamed the midfield area from box to box contributing with buildup and cover space. United didn't play with an asymmetric formation of an AM, a CM and a DM. They played with two CMs as a part of their buildup, not two DMs. You're mixing roles with positioning, because you can clearly play with a defensive minded role further up a pitch without it being a defensive position. He had definite defensive duties in a midfield pivot, playing as a CM alongside McTominay. You can cry and shout all you want that Fred is or was a DM, but you're objectively wrong here. It is. My point in general just was that in their current situation. With probably getting Matip, Tapsoba and Koussonu being more important for their style of play and Tah not wanting to extend his contract. Selling him now would not be that huge of a loss for them He is LB and LCB depth on the left, just as Stanisic is on the right. But the talk about us wanting a LCB never stopped after we signed Ito. Yes, LB and LCB so I fail to see 12m/y for Tah... He didn't even play that many games with Scott. It was mostly with Casemiro (where he was a CM) or with Sabitzer (where he was a DM). Next you're going to say that he and Sabitzer alternated defensive duties when they started together. Check out the 2-0 away at Leeds of you want an example. The only person ""crying and shouting"" here is your. Lol That's true, but only as long as Matip stays fit tbh. Maybe because Ito broke his foot? Ok. You seem to have a hard time processing fact. I can't find my crayons right now to draw you a picture, so I'll resort to tactical analysis of the player. Fred was a defensive minded no 8. https://thebusbybabe.sbnation.com/2021/10/12/22716251/tactical-analysis-what-is-fred-part-i  Here is another tactical analysis of his time at Man Utd.  *""Regardless of which central midfield combination is selected, Matic, McTominay and, since Fernandes' arrival, Pogba remain alternatives in defensive midfield. A concern, surrounding his potential selection as the lone defensive midfielder, is that he has so far not demonstrated the ability to control the spaces in front of defence and that without Matic or Herrera alongside him he is at risk of being overrun.""* https://www.coachesvoice.com/fred-manchester-united-midfield/   Fred and McTominay played 126 times  together in the setup I described, that is a fair amount considering Fred played just 213 in total for the club.  https://www.transfermarkt.com/scott-mctominay/gemeinsameSpiele/spieler/315969/plus/0/galerie/0?gegner=191614&kriterium=2&wettbewerb=&liga=&verein=985&pos=&status=0  He did play as an 8 alongside Casemiro as you said. A grand total of 42 times in one season where Casemiro was the defensive minded one and Fred was a box-to-box CM, his natural role and position.  You're also right that Fred did play with Sabitzer where Fred did play the defensive role. A grand total of 9 times they played together, and on rare occasions Fred was pushed deeper into the DM role with Bruno sitting further back alongside McTominay or Pogba.  Another player not mentioned was Matic who was a DM. Fred played 68 times with him as an 8, with Bruno or Pogba as the offensive playmaker.  So sure. We can look at a few games where Fred was pushed back into a DM role, but that doesn't make him a DM. John O'Shea played in goal once, but that doesn't make him a goalkeeper.  So please. Go ahead and be stubborn, but you're still objectively wrong in your perception of Fred and his position. With it being a free transfer, maybe they buy one more centre back just to make sure We were after Tah before that. Also Ito's back in Nov/Dec. He was never a lone DM at any point in his career. But other than when he was paired with Case or Matic, he was tasked with the main defensive responsibilities of the midfield. Especially under ETH. Since you agreed with that, you understand why I said he was CDM cover. And why Amrabat or another CDM wasn't purchased till after Fred was sold. Keep munching on your crayons."
"[Sky Sports]Matthijs de Ligt open to summer move.","2024-01-20T10:15:00+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/19b8pmm/sky_sportsmatthijs_de_ligt_open_to_summer_move/","Translation, via DeepL.com:

Matthijs de Ligt cost an impressive 67 million euros in July 2022. Now, after just two years, the FC Bayern chapter could soon be history again. According to Sky, the Dutchman is a candidate for sale next summer.

The knee is holding. Following his capsule injury during the training camp in Faro, Portugal, Matthijs de Ligt is fit in time for Sunday's Bundesliga home game against Werder Bremen (3.30pm live ticker). The central defender is likely to be available for the Munich team. But how long will he be wearing the FC Bayern shirt?

As Sky reported exclusively on Transfer Update - the show on Monday, a move in the summer is conceivable for de Ligt. The 24-year-old has no desire to be just a number three or four central defender at FCB.

Min-jae Kim - currently at the Asian Cup - and Dayot Upamecano have their noses in front. Bayern are also on the lookout for another defender. Ronald Araujo from FC Barcelona is and remains Munich's top transfer target for the summer, despite interest from Manchester United.

De Ligt may leave FC Bayern in the summer

Sky has learned that de Ligt's transfer plans have reached the boardroom of the German record champions. The Dutchman is likely to leave the club in the summer if a suitable offer is made - despite having a contract until 2027. There is apparently already an interested party for one of Munich's top earners.

United are monitoring the right-footed player and are keeping a close eye on developments. Should Erik ten Hag, with whom de Ligt already worked successfully during his Ajax days, remain coach at the Red Devils beyond the summer, a move to the island would be conceivable.

In the current season, de Ligt has made twelve appearances for FC Bayern, playing 526 minutes and scoring one goal.","587","Suikerspin_Ei","https://sport.sky.de/fussball/artikel/matthijs-de-ligt-darf-den-fc-bayern-nach-sky-infos-im-sommer-2024-verlassen/13051569/34943"," To reduce the spam of reports regarding the same move during transfer windows we try to allow **only one submission about each transfer saga per day**.

I want to say come back but…. Danilo + bremer + Frederick cats is pretty damn good The whole situation is really dumb and if there’s any truth to it, Im extremely disappointed by MdL  The reason hes 3rd choice is  A) because he missed all of preseason due to injury  B) didnt look better than the other 2 when he got minutes   C) instantly got injured the moment he was fit again  And this cycle happened 2 times now this season. Hes been perma injured or just not on par. Hello This is bs.   Tuchel wants to play with a back 3. He’s well known for it.   De Ligt has literally been injured for most of the season. He played when he wasn’t but Tuchel has clearly said they had to be cautious and were worried about reinjuring him … which is what happened.   Tuchel literally just said in the press conference today for Sundays match *’Tuchel on whether he's planning with de Ligt on the long-term: ""Matthijs came back injured from the national team and missed all preseason. We played him a bit too early in the Supercup, then he got seriously injured again and Minjae and Upa were starting games. But of course we're planning with Matthijs, he is our player, a top player and a top character’* There's something quite fascinating about how none of the players in that Ajax team that reached the CL semi final have really kicked on like expected. He knows he's gonna get benched by Dier See him going to United tbh Looks like he wants to be the main guy and doesnt like competing with other players on his level. Hopefully he does well and changes his mind in the next weeks Please say it ain't so Could suit Liverpool 😂😂 how’s the training going over there. Harder than Juve? Annual Bayern CB sales and purchase season already starting. Chelsea replacing Thiago Silva or United bringing in Ten Hag's old boys would be my guess for potential moves. come to Liverpool baby Gotta be a major failure of man management from Tuchel if he can't rotate enough to keep three top players happy when they're competing for two spots. he's had two bad injuries before the age of 25. he's only likely to slow down more. He'll be a risk, but maybe a worthwhile one for whoever gets him Fucking Tuchel ruining this man. All this guy does is move barely hear about his actual performances. How is he still just 24?? not surprised by a guy who was supposed to come to psg but the deal failed because he insisted on having a release clause which is illegal in france... [deleted] Perfect for United. Another player to add to the injury list every season lol I really wanna see him in a Barca shirt This flop better come with a refund policy That’s really a shame if this is true That doesn't make sense. There were rumors before Christmas that Arteta really wants him. There were also rumors about Gabi XL leaving Arsenal in the summer. 🤔 Heavily doubt this.  Aren't most teams playing a back 3 during the build up phase? And even if u have 2 CBs with the amount of games, each team needs atleast 4 CBs.  Plus De Light was very good under Nagelsmann. I don't watch Bayern but have read ppl saying Tuchel wants to play a back 3 so De Light can be a starter. Plus the fact that Bayern signed Dier as backup n wanted Pavard to stay. I would think Real Madrid might take a punt on him, but i think they already have someone else in mind From potential next Captain to being sold. Thanks Tuchel.... Quite funny to see the UK referred to as 'the island' ¹ Why is this writing so weird? Is it by a bot?  If he can’t hack it in the Bundesliga, he’ll be murder in the prem. Also, he had his chance to come. Let’s stop being second (or third, or fourth!) choice. Would not be upset to see him at Chelsea, he seems more than able than all of our defenders this season, and Thiago can’t run forever (unfortunately). We should try for araujo , can't let Bayern get him , first kimjae min now araujo:( Former ajax player under ten hag. Ye, thats almost an auto-pick.    Edit: apparently ten Hag wants to get brobbey from ajax as well. DB\_Cooper727 legacy Can’t wait for him to be benched by Jonny Evans by November. So 90 mil bid and 8 year contract? Actually with the Ineos boys I'm pretty confident we're moving away from that Hopefully Ten Hag will be gone before this can happen United has built up such reputation that they take whatever is on the market. They got to stop being like a6 year old who wants to buy every new shiny toy they see ✅ Hope not, an expensive IP player is the last thing United need in their revamp. It has also written all over that it will be yet another flop. None of ETH's Ajax team seem to have reached the hype and potential after moving club. Van De Beek, De Ligt, Ziyech and De Jong (best of the bunch).    De Ligt certainly seems to have leadership qualities and is still young. Either he needs a break and keep his fitness or find a team not stacked with decent centre backs.    Also, Dier must be cleaning Kane's boots for the rest of the season for helping facilitate that move.  Plus we signed Djalo, and have Rugani as backup. No need to take up De ligt's 12 million salary on board, when he is still error prone. Is Bremer doing well? Yeah no thx... He would earn as much as the three combined. Are juventini happy to have Danilo as captain? I feel like he's always had a great attitude but imo he's also always been too average to play for a top club. I can't remember one time I saw his name in Brazil's squad and thought ""he's the right guy for the RB position, we're so lucky to have him"". Just makes a bid from United all the more likely It’s also just normal at a top club. There’s two spots for CBs and you normally have three top ones. That means depending on form and injury you will have stints where you start and stints where you don’t. Look at real with Rüdiger, Alaba and Militao. If you don’t want that to to a lesser club and be the best there Why does that make you extremely disappointed?    Top class player wants to play first team football at the highest level, color me surprised. He's not saying anything about his benching being unfair, is he? I think the issue is less that he's third choice and more that they reportedly want to sign another top CB.  TBH there's no way he's going to knock Kim off his mark, he's only looked better and better since his transfer. As someone who isn't a fan of Bayern Munich he'd arguably be a huger deal for the team if it wasn't for Kane transferring during the same window. I would rather be disappointed in a player who is content with sitting on bench. I don't get this weird take at all. He was a genuine contender for our player of the season last year so I’m not sure I’m ready to give up on him over some bad injury luck in a half season 3rd choice at bayern and big clubs is pretty good especially considering his injuries. Goodbye If Antony is 100m than De Light has to be at least 2 billion > Tuchel wants to play with a back 3. He’s well known for it.  Tuchel also wants Araujo though Last years de Ligt was really class, but Idk if hes captain material if hes forfeiting the first months when hes having a rough spell I'd say Frenkie de Jong has done alright. de ligt and de jong were consistent and relied upon starters for big teams since. Only recently with Bayern and I don't catch almost no BuLi but I suspect he's not his best physically. The other two are beasts and worthy starters. de Ligt is such a monster when he's full steam. Frenkie is magnificent, he's just in a non performing Barca team. I mean many factors can affect the players. The coach, the team they're playing for, environment, injuries, private situations etc. De Ligt was Bayern's best player last season De Ligt en de Jong were the only ones expected to become world class though. They are not far off that level. And De Ligt is still only 24. If you don't watch football then I guess so. Even looking at De Ligt, he has had a total of 6 seasons at Ajax, Juventus and Bayern. He averaged over 40 games per season on club level. He's 24 with over 350 professional games as a CB for top clubs. Like what more do you expect? Sissoko broke them that night… Just the first victim. They’ll switch to a back 1 in the first inverted Christmas tree formation.  Could do 50 million but depends on how much getting his old fwb’s from Ajax motivates Ten Hag If that’s the case he may need to consider playing for a slightly lower side where he’d be the clear standout. Not a regular title winner type side, but one of the sides that push those types of sides.   Otherwise, where else can he go and expect to be clearly the best centre back and have a high chance of a title win? There’s not too many teams I can think of. Im suprised how Joe Gomez is still a liverpool player. Dude is a bundesliga level defender. united won't buy him. Bayern will want upwards for 70 million gbp for him and i don't think our new board will make a move like that. Also his injury history, this early into his career will only get worse in england. The only real spell where de Ligt was available was 6 weeks at the beginning of the season. After he missed all of pre-season.  After that, he was injured for all but 2 weeks. Not really Tuchel's fault tho is it. De Ligt has been injured quite a lot this season Incredibly false Became captain for Ajax at a young age. His age was also a reason why some people thought he was too young to move to Italy, before Bayern signed him. Flopped? He was good last season. Injuries and new (expensive) players just ruined his chance to play more for Bayern. Should’ve been where he went after us, i really do think that that juve move did him no favors. I used DeepL.com to translate German to English. So some grammar is not 100% correct. Do you rate Disasi Brobbey would be such an awful transfer lol, they already have a young striker in Hojlund. They should look at a more experienced striker He wanted Brobbey in the summer. Stop letting this man choose players Nah, Tuchel likes Chalobah, so it's going to be a swap plus cash :D I'd much rather Tobido over Brobbery but De Ligt and Tobido would be a coup for us if we still have that draw and credibility. De Ligt alone would be a good move for us. There’s absolutely no way Ten Hag is here in summer if form continues The best ever Reddit post, love how he mudded those muppetiers Thanks for reminding me about that God tier karma court post [DB gang](https://imgflip.com/i/8d043k) Think you're mixing us up with another club, we don't do 8 year contracts. Just 5 year contracts where the player is garbage for 4 years and then turns up for a month or 2 and then gets a new 5 year contract and goes back to being garbage. > So 90 mil bid and 8 year contract?  Chelsea: make it 100M and he'll replace Silva next season. He said United not Chelsea Hello I saw your comment and looked at your flair and wondered how times have changed. De Jong is brilliant at Barca and de Ligt has been pretty good at both Juve and Bayern. Think he'll be fine. Still one of the best young CBs. Younger than Upamecano for example just been around a long time. That’s the worst take I’ve read on Frenkie in a while. He’s one of the best midfielders in the world and he is so so important to Barca. De Ligt and Ziyech are both quality but injured a lot, De Jong is actually very good so that’s just a bad take in general.  Ziyech looked phenomenal at the start of his Chelsea career in the preseason but got injured for a long time so quickly that they built the team without him instead of utilising his talents. He had to slot in to what was already built instead of being a focal point of it What more do you want of De Jong? I can't name 3 better centermidfielders. De Ligt has been injured a lot this season, but got into the Team of the Season for the BuLi last year. Also Veltman's doing great  Almost forgot Onana, amazing goalkeeper. A few mistakes at utd is not going to change that Frenkie de Jong is the best and single most impactful player at Barça and legitimately the best in the world at what he does. Count the manager too That was such a fraudulent CL run. They beat the worst Madrid side in a decade and edged past Juve, only to fold to a Lucas Moura hat trick  Such a fluke. wtf dier is at bayern ?! 🤣 we also have a new dutch prodigy cb Biased, but he is a beast. Physically he dominates and rarely makes technical mistakes. I see why two seasons ago he won Serie A defender of the year almost unanimously. By far the best defender at Juve and arguably the best defender in the league. If his distribution was better he'd be the best defender in the world. The guy is a brick wall. At the risk of sounding bitter, he's been an upgrade over DeLigt in every way possible. Unquestionably best defender in the team since 2017/18 Chielini. In a back 3 he can be one of the best defenders in the world if we’re talking purely defending, his passing and confidence on the ball could definitely improve Easily among our top 3 players, if not the best. One of the best defender in Italy. I'm biased, though. Since you got all responses from juve flairs, I’ll add that yes he’s been a beast this season. Strong tackler, reads the game well to cover, and is great 1 on 1 Idk about the captaincy but Danilo has been solid for Juve since he arrived, filling in everywhere in the defence and doing well at that he’s so solid and has versatile skillsets for all phases. others correct me if i’m wrong but captaincy is basically down to tenure and xi slot perfect replacement for Varane De Ligt + Sneijder 10 years 100m no troubles Yeah but how is he going to get minutes for any club with all those injuries? If he stays fit he will be a starter for Bayern again because he is better than Upamecano. United season 2023/2024 Watch us spend this money and still not spend £50,000 to fix a leaky fucking roof. But Antony is, quite clearly, not 100m which makes sense, because you need a backup if you want to compete in three tournaments for the win and have 3 starters Its not a great look, but you dont know what is playing on the background. Bayern did get expensive replacement for him. Maybe Tuchel and De Ligt dont match. He wasn't really having a rough spell right, he just got injured? >Idk if hes captain material if hes forfeiting the first months when hes having a rough spell  it seems like you're bitter about him wanting to leave He's done alright. But the expectations were higher than 'alright'. He's won 1 league title, no CL and has been on the wrong side of so many beatdowns and embarassements in big games, especially in the CL. The thing with Frenkie is that he never shows up for the NT. Just an ok performance every time he plays, sometimes below it. He was a monster last season. He was our player of the season imo and this year he's struggled to stay healthy.  Tuchel also wants a ball-playing CB which is why Upamecano is so valued. But De Ligt played last week for the first time in months and was poor in ball progression. Yeah De Jong is a fantastic midfielder. All our bullshit means he goes under the radar sometimes. >I don't catch almost no BuLi but I suspect he's not his best physically  He's basically been perma-injured this season.  Missed pre season, so Tuchel went for Kim/Upamecano for the first few games. As soon as he got his chance, he was injured for two months, came back for two weeks, then was injured again. Now Kim is away at the Asia Cup and he is injured again.  He has strong competition at CB, but this season, he didn't manage to get a lengthy spell of being uninjured. I agree. I'm not placing blame or criticism. I just find it interesting that it was a very hyped team and none of them have really kicked on to the extent that was anticipated. I'm not disputing he's had a decent career so far. But he was talked about as being on track to be one of the best defenders in the world. There's still time for that, but I think it's fairly undeniable he's not yet achieved the level that was expected by many. Unironically Man United He makes 16m€/year or something in that region so there arent too many options for him. Maybe United if they can convince him with a clear plan for the future, but imo he should really fight for his spot instead of taking a step down Gomez has been excellent this season, one of the the main reasons we are still in all competitions. Can tell you have not watched them this season Barca had to pick between him and fdj. Fdj is amazing, so can't say it was a bad decision, but yeah Barca would've been the best fit for De Ligt as well. I do as a CB, but Silva does a lot of heavy lifting in the partnership imho Yep, they need someone proven from Ajax, maybe Henderson? my hope is solanke. We need someone prem proven Link? A tale as old as time Will the coach you sign him for last that long? So 90 mil bod and 400k wages? That's very strong saying Onana's amazing currently maybe he used to be but there is nothing atm that suggests he is ""amazing"", if he was amazing he wouldn't of made so many mistakes because good keepers minimise their howlers. Well that investment was well worth it then. People were saying that he was better than De ligt when De ligt moved to bayern, which i thought was an overreaction. Wasn't De Ligt's last season very good though?  I thought he did an amazing job his last season (wasn't that impressive the first two). He was great at Torino, surprised more didn't get bidding > because he is better than Upamecano.  hell no You think Araujo would come from Barca to Bayern to be a backup? Araujo would start so who'd he bench? Quite funny because the summer de ligt went to bayern tuchel was pushing for him to sign for chelsea. They did get replacement for Lucas Mate, he's been by far Barcelona's best player over the last few years. How were the expectations ever higher than that? Wtf. Yeah you clearly don't watch barca We’re just nerfing him right now. He is our best player wdym? What? He is the best player on the Barcelona team.. You're equating Barca being poor recently with their individual players being poor as well.   Frenkie has met all the expectations at the time of his transfer. Are people still doing the laziest thinking possible by equating how well a player has played with the team's overall results? Team performance =/= personal performance.   Frenkie has been great for Barca dafuq are you on about Bias clearly showing there lmao Except for (Heerenveen legend) Dumfries he's our most important player what are you talking about? This is a genuine question: is Upa a ball-playing CB? I'm aware that N=1 here but I've only seen that one disasterclass of him in the CL against City where he gave away multiple goals, and I wouldn't have pegged him as a ball-playing CB after that.  > Now Kim is away at the Asia Cup and he is injured again.  Hes actually fit to play tomorrow Frenkie de Jong is doing fine at Barcelona. Tadic is also doing great at Fenerbahçe. De Ligt did well at Juventus and last year at Bayern. Daley Blind at Girona is scoring goals in the last few matches. Probably missed some players, but the rest are indeed not doing well from the 2019 CL team. A cb pairing of de ligt and martínez would be insane He'd clearly be the best CB at Man U, but a high chance of a title win? They've not come remotely close to challenging for 10 years - even in the seasons where they've come second they've been >10 points behind the champions. Good shout Swap with barca He cost Liverpool so many points in the league and made errors left and right in the champions league. Playing a decent half season for the first time in his life i guess makes up for everything. Solanke is ""Premier League proven"" now? The same Solanke who had 10 goals in 96 PL matches before this season? Thats terrible business Lmfaoooo Hot af take but i would love to have Calum Wilson here . And yes I’m ignoring his injury history For some reason can't post links to soccercourt so gonna message it to you, if anyone else wants to read it, message me > Will the coach you sign him for last that long?  I don't know. If Bayern need to replace Tuchel with another ex-Chelsea manager, maybe Poch will be available. None of the coaches at top clubs today will be there in 8 years so I don’t think that’s the slight you think it is Much better I'd say, Bremer is better than De Ligt in everything apart from comfort on the ball and passing range.   If Gleison starts scoring a few more from set pieces and improves his passing and comfort on his weak foot, he'd be in the arguement for the CB itw. Had some mistakes in him but overall was very good especially for his age. Bremer Is Better all around but as everyone else said De Ligt Is better with the ball Yeah it was, but Bremer has just been overall more consistent player. I don’t watch Bundesliga much but didn’t he make horrific mistakes in the CL that everyone mocked him for? he wouldn't be the backup De Light most likely eric dier Hasn't scored more goals or assists than Messi's best season. Disasterclass. Do you not remember how high expectations were for him? His performances have been decent enough. But he hasn't turned into the level of player many anticipated. “By far” what nonsense - Ter Stegen, Araujo Pedri Gavi and Lewandowski have been far better how has this been upvoted? I've watched them plenty. He's been fine, good at times. But at 26 he is not the player that many anticipated he would be when he was young. I know. I didn't say 'he's not Barcelona's best player'. Damning with faint praise. I haven't said he's been poor. I said he hasn't kicked on like expected. Which I believe is true, given what expectations were. Always have been No, but his performances in those crucial games have been equally as bad. Just watch his performance for the 8-2 for example. For 700k a week, you'd expect a leader to drag your team out of the mud. His performances in those crucial games have been equally as bad. Just watch his performance for the 8-2 for example. For 700k a week, you'd expect a leader to drag your team out of the mud. Nah lol, name one good game he had in the NT? He is a weird case. Carrying the ball out the back and building up, he is up there with the best in the world without question. But about 2-3 times a season he has games in him where he just keeps making horrendous mistakes. You're right. He just missed parts of the training camp. I don't think either de Jong or de Ligt have consistently reached the level it was anticipated they would.  Onana has been up and down. De Beek has basically disappeared. Ziyech was a big disappointment at Chelsea.  They were the players that were most hyped as future prospects. But none of them hit the levels expected. That doesn't mean they're not good players and have performed well. But expectations for their careers were very high. As in insanely good or insane like Martinez is? it wont happen. Bayern will want upwards for 70 mill for him, and our financial situation wouldn't be able to pull that off. The glazers operated on a ""buy now pay later"" strategy, and that has fucked us quite a bit. Was first choice centre back next to Van Dijk for the entire 19/20 league winning season which was built on a rock-solid defence. Important role in 18/19 and 21/22 also.  He's also been happy to play back up at times and covers the entire defence and is home grown. Literally can't think of a player who covers all of these that we could realistically sign and would be on similar wages. Yeah I don’t know what you’ve been watching. I won’t say that he’s the best defender ever, but whenever he has had a run of consistent games he has done well. For the last few seasons he has been 3rd or 4th choice CB or backup RB and he’s perfectly fine as that. This season he has shown he’s perfectly solid covering the backline in a premier league title challenging team, don’t know why you would want to get rid of him lol It's so easy to speak out of your ass huh this sub has a 2 month memory at best Please message me Please message me as well :) >replace Tuchel with another ex-Chelsea manager  Lampard to Bayern, here we go! Simeone will be there Yes >But he hasn't turned into the level of player many anticipated.  You clearly don't watch the Dutch NT and/or Barcelona. He's by far the best player in both squads. Just because his G&A stats aren't great it doesn't mean he isn't a good player? Not sure why you are being downvoted, he has been a disappointment compared to the hype - he was the midfield signing of the window, had expectations of carrying the Busquets/Xavi torch, and has since been completely outshone by Gavi/Pedri. If he is Barça’s best player this season it’s because all other top midfielders have been injured and the rest of the team is playing ass. [removed] and just by mentioning Lewa your whole opinion is disqualified Havent watched any full Barca games in over 2 years I see. Only Ter Stegen can be argued LOL > He's been fine, good at times  If you have actually watched Barca this season,  I don't think you really understand what you're watching. You know they won the league just last year right? I keep reading you say this. Can you tell me what expectations people had of him then? Are people really this fucking dumb? [deleted] I agree about Ziyech and Van de Beek, but disagree about De Ligt and De Jong. All we can agree on is that injuries and other factors affected their performances. If de ligt and martinez stay fit you would probably have one of the best defences in the league https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siPZab5M5Ew deeney’s a free agent now 👀 So will Allegri 😘 I haven't said he isn't a good player? Bro what are you waffling about? Smoking fifa22 Based on performance and impact on last year's league title lewandowski was much more important compared to de jong heck only ter stegen seemed better purely in terms of impact on the team The fact that I listed 5 players and you took issue with only one and had no evidence for that is what disqualification is Or, and stick with me here, maybe football is a subjective sport and I have different standards to you. You know that doesn't mean he's lived up to the expectations right? Yet they were embarrassing in the European competition. Do you not remember the discourse around him? He was being hyped up as the next big thing, someone who would go on to be a generational great. There's still time for him to be that, but at 26 I would say he's not where many expected he would be by this age. > you  I didn't know that I was responsible for paying De Jong's wages or a Barca fan lol In theory. It's still United. He has been decent this season but absolutely not the first time, he was amazing in 19/20 and a season or 2 before that What more do you want him to do other than being the best player for Barca & the Netherlands?  Yes, the Barcelona side he joined has been poor. However on a personal level did you expect him to win 3 ballon d'ors by now? He’s a top 3 midfielder in the world this season, dunno what your expectations were lmao I know you not got a lot of entertainment on the field but no need to make fake drama off it you've got to be clinically insane to actually believe this. Yeah, you just have higher standards than virtually everyone else (professionally involved in football or not) that I've heard talk about de Jong's quality this season. That must be it. If you expected a high scoring attacking midfielder then the expectations were wrong from the start lol What are you on about? Everyone is happy with FDJ he literally is our best midfielder The only aspect I remember of this discourse that maybe contributes to your argument is that he was extremely hyped after Ajax’s CL success and deemed a ‘Busquets replacement’ by many when Barca signed him. Everyone thought he would just slot in and Barca would be amazing. Well, it didn’t really turn out that way unfortunately, especially because he’s a very different player from Busi. And then I feel like the spotlight went off him a bit when Pedri and Gavi started to thrive. They do what people like to watch in midfield on TV, but he really makes the whole team tick. You're saying it like being the best player at Barca is an accomplishment.   They even tried to kick him out of the team. He should be competing for CL Being the best player doesn't mean he has met the expectations there were for him.  I've got several responses saying 'but he's a good player' or 'he's been Barca's best player'. I don't disagree with either. But that doesn't mean he's lived up to the hype that was around him as a young player. bro wtf how is he top 3 midfielders this season? Rodri,bellingham,rice,bernardo,bruno all are better Lmao last year lewa actually had clutch goals and barca won almost all matches by 1 goal margin, this year he is finished but again what has de jong done? All the de jong hype of being best player of barcelona seems a joke, man isn't the best midfielder in the team I don't think anybody expected that. I haven't said he's not. People keep replying that, as if it's somehow incompatible with my point. It's not. It is though? What is going on here? lmao, clear enough that you never watch anything other then prem. bellingham is obviously better, rodri fair enough. but he is 100% better then rice and bernardo this season and let's not talk about bruno fernandes, bruno is one of the most overrated players in the prem atm. i don't think anyone knows what you expected from him. Bruno has to be one of the best players playing in a crap team,if man was in madrid/bayern he would have easily been regarded as top 3 midfielder in the world,he is world class in that shit united team I didn't really have any personal expectations around him. But I can remember what the discourse around him was and how much he was hyped up. But he isn't playing in Madrid/Bayern. He is playing in a shit United team and doing better than most of his teammates but certainly not playing world class. Has the best creative stats in Europe  If only our forwards could finish 😭 Big If"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Crazy that Atleti paid €127.2m for Joao Felix…feel like he never was able to adjust to the big stage. Current market value is at €30m what a downfall even though he is still young and technically still could make a turnaround I forgot what Lavia’s face looks like Where would Estêvão Willian be on this list potentially? Fabio Silva cost 5 million less than Vinicius and Rodrygo. Fucking Jorge bloody Mendes. Absolute thief. Was dembele not a teenager when barca bought him? Or bellingham? God I remember when Luke Shaw was the #1 spot about 10 years ago. The amount of money being spent in the sport is ludicrous Damn Real has been good at buying teenagers. Rodrygo and Vinicius feels like steals at these prices That Felix transfer was absurd then and seems even more absurd in hindsight. He showed nothing worthy of this pricetag, what were they thinking. Lavia fourth and hasn't had more than one game for Chelsea lmao Does anyone have an estimate of PSGs total outlay to for Mbappe during his time there? Wasn’t Bellingham 19 when Real signed him? Fabio Silva is awful. I’ve seen some shite fucking players at rangers that cost us around 150k that are better than him. Worst player I’ve seen in a rangers shirt in a while.  Absolute fanny aswell. You know you’re awful when both Rangers AND Celtic fans hate you I remember how people were memeing real for buying brazilians teenagers for 45m to replace CR7 whle leaving Benzema as the only real attacking threat  With hindsight, I'd say Perez made it work Mbappe, Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr are the only definitely successful transfers there. Should we really count transfers that were obviously some sort of money laundering scheme? (Fabio Silva) The final fee for Anthony Martial was €52m. Nearly €180m spent on one player and then make absolutely no money whatsoever back on him.  PSG must be fucking fuming. What has happened with De Ligt's career since? And Mbappe now leaves on a free at his prime 💀 Mbappé? That’s Lottin.  IYKYK This picture of Mbappe reminds of fifa 17 with Lottin 😂 180 as a teen is crazy That Felix transfer still baffles me!  The moment news started linking him with a move to Atleti I was confused and thought it was pure nonsense, and the fact it actually happened was even more bizarre. He's simply not the type of player that Simeone uses or needs. He didn't fit his style of play, and yet, Atleti still paid an insane amount of money for him. So him failing was to be expected, I just don't understand how their board didn't see it as a mismatch for their club. Crazy that the only 3 that lived up to the potential (so far) are playing at Madrid with a 4th one having a shot at it.  (Yes, I do not consider De Ligt as having ""lived up to his potential"" when you remember how much he was hyped up during his Ajax days) Who the hell is Lavia and why Chelsea keep doing this things? Vini was a fucking bargain Easy to say that Félix is overrated, was a waste of money, etc, but that move was as bad for him as it was for Atlético. João Félix was indeed an unique talent and everyone could see that he would not fit Atlético. Only 2 of these have paid out for that club so far , damn Vini/rodrygo/endrick for just over Felix is insane business Real Madrid with two of the biggest bargains Crazy…Endrick already wears the Brazilian 9 shirt Rodrygo, Vinicius, and Endrick for almost the price of Joao Felix 💀 Normally a player is under contract for five years, what is the advantage in paying a young unproven talent more than 50mil? 180 for mbappe and now Madrid get him for free… €40m for Fabio Silva is... well, it's mental. Especially in the middle of a pandemic and a club record fee for Wolves.   Although it is slightly funny to me that we essentially paid for him because we bought Jota for £41m two weeks later. Bellingham literally missed that list by 2 days Madrid scouts are something else! It feels weird seeing wolves on the buying side of a chart like this Joao felix is the biggest flop corresponding to his big transfer fee Vini for 45m is crazy.. It is a disgrace what Barça did with Roque. 3 of them worth it? Paratici smoking some insane fucking drugs at Juve Will roque get more minutes now that xavi is gone? Diego Simeone is nearing the one billion euro mark in terms of his transfer spend as Atletico Madrid boss. El Cholo has spent a total of 987 million euros on 60 different players since arriving at Los Rojiblancos in December 2011 To come to think of it  RM basically spent 120+ mill on 4 players to secure their present and future attackers So many bad/failed signings there Fabio Silva for 40m is wild considering a few years later he's been mediocre for Rangers in the spfl this season. Atleti might regret spending that big on Felix because he never adjusted to their style of play. Vitor Roque was bought for 30 + 30M€ in bonuses. Confirmed by Deco.  This 40M€ figure doesn't exist. These stats are pointless when inflation isn't counted I wish there was more than 10. Seeing Arda Güler would be great. I remember being downvoted for saying Silva to wolves made no sense Flamengo a cabra 🐐 Filthy transfer business by Perez, guy is a visionary 4 brazilians 🤩 thanks for the laugh Still blows my mind that Mppape left on a free transfer. So .. the moral of the story is only pay overs for teens if Real want the player I guess? This Brazilian trio goes hard ngl. Real Madrid have been cooking over their last few years. And to think. Martial is the only one on the list that came good. Mbappe is still untested after playing for such a small team for so long.  S/ If only mbappe stayed at Monaco And 180 were still not enough for Kylian Lavia is unfortunate getting injured. He seems promising and I would hope that injury doesn’t impact his growth Felix is such a flop for that transfer money The bottom 5 have more trophies than the top 5 lmaooo By adding 10 million to Endrick, Vinicius and Rodrygo transfer fees you get one Felix lmao Lavia was 19 when he was transfered Amazing how many Brazilians  there are. And how many are over rated. Its fun how you can see that Brazil got better at negotiating Lavia 👀 .. Where are Bellingham and Dembele? There are some really questionable transfers in that list lmao price tag kinda says otherwise but did Martial look as promising as Mbappe with Monaco? Mbappé is gonna finish his career as one of the greatest to ever do it and lavia was never seen again Nobody can beat Neymar santos, that was something else €180m for Mbappe compared to €15m (around €26m today) for a 19 year old R9 from PSV to Barca... crazy how much transfer costs have increased. I remember when Wolves billed Silva as a “generational talent” I think Mbappe was also one of the first to move, so his price is actually in a lower inflated market than most of the others. I wonder what the top 10 looked like when he first made that move We had Chelseas pants down of Lavia saying we were in for him, they took both him and Caicedo for about 4x they are both worth lmao. Barca with zero good buys. most of the players on that list hahahah What is a Lavia mbabe looks skibidi photoshopped 💀 As a United fan….. Big fucking ooooooooof whoever wrote that most expensive teenager list never went on a sex tourism trip to Thailand Joao felix is overrated (change my mind) How many minutes has Lavia played for Chelsea? To think Rodrygo and Vini costed Real the same is wild. I hate Vini’s ethics as he always seems unsportsmanlike, but the talent is undeniable Im convinced that Lavia would have won a player of the year in Belgium and would be further in his career is he stayed. Mbappe is so overrated Check the relationship between Benfica, Atlético, Jorge Mendes, Enrique Cerezo and Luis Filipe Vieira, that may explain why Atletico paid 120 Mendilions, pardon me, Millions of Euros for Félix. It's crazy how few games he had before atletico gave benfica that fee The biggest decline on that team is Saul in my opinion. He was such a great player at such a young age. I honestly thought he would become top 15 player in the world at some point. He was also good for national team both senior and u21. When I red 2 years ago that he's going to Chelsea on loan I was like wtf, in my mind he was still a beast. Don't really know what happened to him Crazier that it was Atletico of all clubs to do that too. They are usually extremely shrewd in the transfer market, buy low sell high (if they do decide to sell). There are certain clubs that expect take that risk/ make that misstep, and Atletico were never on that list until Felix Was such a weird thing. Ofc hindsight is always 20/20, but he wasn't really the typical player type for Atleti. Especially with that kind of money Felix has been mediocre since Atleti signed him Everyone talks about Barca splashing Neymar money on getting Griezzman, no one talks about Atleti splashing Griezzman money on Felix They had just made over 100 million by selling griezmann and were desperate for a replacement Technically yes he could. Would need to adjust his attitude and turn up more than once every 10 games though. Man had a 3 month purple patch in portugal and atletico went insane.. Is that really the craziest one? Fábio Silva is a second league player at best and was sold for that much. João Félix was absolutely brilliant for Benfica as a youngster. Incredibly talented and wasted by the club(s) and himself. Atleti's only chance to swap him with PSG for like Kolo Muani. Or maybe City would swap him for Bernardo or Grealish. Bernardo said a lot he would want to leave to Spain.   Or...of course...the saudis. Felt so crazy for Atleti to go that big, how did they even get that kind of money to throw at one player? And why was it the least Simeone player possible? wasn't that the summer atleti sold griezmann? benfica probably fleeced them knowing they had money. Benfica are master sellers :) Thought he'd be what Dybala was pre injuries Something dodgy with that deal. no worries a.madird did it well by selling griezman to barca for 120+ bonusses after 2 years they got him back for 30m? [deleted] Watching him play this past year, no way is he worth 127m... A flop that no one talks about because no one wants to criticize Simone I can't believe he only played 32 minutes in the Premier the whole year. That's the same here. What really happened to him? Injuries or poor form? I still think he should've gone to Liverpool instead. 40m base + 25m addos as per Fabrizio, so at most would put him at 4th. He couldn’t even cut it in the Scottish league, even Rangers fans were happy to see him go when his loan expired lol. Don't know what wolves were thinking spending that much on a 18 year old who has no physical attributes. Especially for premier league It’s a disaster signing All clubs must compete to sign elite young players. Only real Madrid has massive pull that attracts players. It  is irritating to see their fans claiming that Real Madrid management is genius for signing ""hidden"" gems for cheap.   It is not like players like Rodrygo, Camavinga, Vini and others weren't on the radar of other clubs. It is the fact when Real Madrid comes calling.. Players obey . Same with João felix... What a business It's funny, Jorge Mendes is either a villain or a hero, depending on if the people at your club know his tricks.  We've been fine with him at Liverpool, bringing us Fabinho, Jota, Darwin, and helping us shift Fab when his legs had gone. But then you see some other clubs and how they've ended up with crap... Wolves felt like they were cheated in the deal. Bellingham agreed when he was 19, but contract was officially signed when he was already 20. Dembele signed August 2017 but turned 20 in May of that year. Rooney was the same price but it was 20 years ago. Adjusted for (football) inflation it would be right up next to Mbappe's fee. inflation, amiright? Should be said that Vini was signed just weeks after making his professional debut for Flamengo. Extremely good signing but it was a big fee at the time   Obviously Juni Calafat knows exactly what he is doing though Bare in mind they signed another Brazilian wonderkid around the same time for 40m euros or so and I think they already released him for free. Of course 2/3 is a strong hit rate, but buying such young players is a risk. The best signings in recent years tbh. They get in there young It’s their youth academy, buying other people’s youth 😂 Well we talk about Real Madrid... It used to be Barca such a legend club  but it def has changed since messi's departure.. You see how dangerous real built the team with the youngsters ...  They might fail for a couple years but they come back. Perez isn't a joke Unlike us, they actually play their teenagers purchases. Pellistri at madrid wouldve gotten a lot of minutes instead of rotting at alaves or on our bench. Member when vini was a joke? They still had faith and let him play. We gave pellistri 10 min and since he didnt score 5 we benched him for the rest of the season. 'Holy shit we have sold players for a ton of money, we have to spend it real quick, who's the most hyped wonderkid right now? Joao Felix? Sure, here's 127 million' if you watch his Benfica highlights on youtube (and there are plenty) before the transfer and considering his young age, Felix really looked like one of those generational talents. Probably he is/was a generational talent, he just did not make it. They thought he was a sure thing to reach his potential, which obviously was an error. He was one of the best talents coming out of Benfica's academy for many years and that says a lot since it is maybe the best academy in the world  He never managed to move past being a ""flashes"" player though. At Atleti, Barca and even Chelsea there have been flashes of quality that makes you think ""okay I understand why he once went for 100M+"" but can't manage to put it together. Also I think the price tag got to his head and made him think that working hard is not a must Yeah but he had that one great champions league match. After Hazard to Real Madrid, the biggest flop of the past half dozen years. That has to be the worst piece of transfer business Atletico did in their history tbh Anyone in this thread calling Felix to not have been worth that much money at that stage has either got memory issues or has started watching football after then. Like others have said,  Felix was considered a generational talent at that point with his performances at Benfica. 127m is inflated sure but he was worth 80m at least at that point. That would still put him second highest there. Hes young ,he cant still recover and find his footing 32 minutes to be exact thank you 😭 So what, he still has 14 years left on his contract. Plenty to criticize about with Chelsea’s transfer but Lavia seems harsh. He’s played one game in one season after getting hurt. It happens. Tbf you can't really classify him as a flop yet, poor lad's just been injured hey he looked good that one time Shame because he was one of the few bright lights when we got relegated, was absolutely  incredible on his day but I have no clue why he decided to go to Chelsea rather than somewhere like Liverpool Yeah. they love paying loads for players who never play. Then they sell them for loads only to rebuy them for even more. It’s a great model really.  Edit: 🎣 As a Liverpool fan, £20m for Endo feels like an absolute steal now. It felt mad at the time, a 30yo, but he's done a great job there and acts as a good placeholder until Bajcetic is over his growth spurt.   Both Caicedo and Lavia were well overpriced, and Caicedo is slowly emerging into a decent player (not £120m worth, though). Lavia has been unfortunate with injuries and could still break through, but I feel like if you're gonna spend big money for a DM, you expect the finished article or at least close (Fabinho, Rodri, Fernandinho etc), either way, big money, you want their best years ready made.  I actually can't believe we were serious for either of them at the prices they went for They gave this man the bidget of a mid-sized country to win L1 most of the time. I did the math a while ago from all the trustworthy sources I found. From sign-on fees to wages, commissions & family bribes (€50mil to his mother) it was to the tune of 570mil euros. That doesn’t include the transfer fee & the commissions on the transfer. My guess is probably because he's born on the 29th of June and although he was announced on the 14th of June 2023, the contract would be signed on the 1st of July which is when the transfer window officially opens. So he would be considered to have signed for Real Madrid just as he turned 20. His transfer was officially done on July 1st, 2 days after his 20th birthday.  But his transfer was already announced 2 weeks prior when he was 19. That's what I was thinking too, but no one else seems to have queried so was wondering if I misunderstood the list! He'd be third, I think One of those players that failed when jumping to the professional level, he was a very huge talent in the youth system but never did anything on the main team. Mendes had some % of his rights so he sold him as quick as possible before he could have more minutes at senior level. People will always say Félix, but Fábio IS the craziest one here. Félix was nothing short of a wonder kid at Benfica and Atlético had to pay the release clause because we didn't want to sell. Fábio Silva was and is a bum. Ouch hadn't realized how badly that had gone Barcelona panic bought Vitor Roque when Madrid signed Endrick and now they want to offload him not even after half a season there. That what Vini & Rodrygo signings did. Roque and Endrick have time to prove themselves. If Martial’s muscles weren’t made of silly string he could have been a great player De ligt was pretty good aswell even if they did overpay mbappe was a performance success but not an actual success, he didnt bring anything to psg that they wouldnt have won without him (João Feliz) I'd say his commercial pull helped bring in a ton of money, in the form of tickets and gear and other ""engagement"" In true joker fashion, it's not about the money  They easily could have sold him for 100M+ when Real Madrid made the offer like 2 or 3 years ago If you account for club popularity and jersey sales, he blew it out of the park. I mean having him on the team is already a win. Imagine how more popular PSG got around the world for Mbappe. Lmao they paid for him to be their star. They didn't cut any losses because they felt they might as well have a go at the Champions League. Almost made it to a final.  Levy valued one more year of Kane at around €99M, and would have let him walk for free afterward. Bayern paid €100M so they got him.  You pay for a players services and only sell when someone is offering more than what you think the rest of his contract is worth. Mbappe puts PSG on the map and casuals know PSG due to Mbappe. Intangible return are pretty hard to quantify but i think overall PSG will see it as a W.  However now that Mbappe is gone, not sure how PSG as a brand is going to continue Oh yea and all those shirt sales, trophies, fans he won for them are worth zilch They're owned by the country of Qatar. If you think €180m is a lot for that country, then you need to research more about their wealth. They're owned by Qatar lmao, having him as the face of PSG (especially before the Qatar WC) was worth far more to them that the financial outlay. Don't forget heavy bonusses for him! Mbappe single handedly put the entire French league on the map.   Before Mbappe people and the media only used to say ""the top 4 leagues"" instead of top 5. Weird. Stagnated, but at a high level if that makes sense. He - thus far - is that regen in football manager that has reached his pa at age 20 (for the FM nerds).  Juventus was an ill-fit for him personally. He became a better defender, but he wants to be able to play the ball as well. At Bayern he's been good, but not outstanding. He's also been struggling with fitness a bit, not helping his case with lots of competition for the center back position.  So still a great center back for any CL level club, but thus far not fulfilling the insane promise he showed at Ajax. Bro cant actually defend  Bunch of people on a subreddit for football fans pretending to not understand what a free transfer is   Its sad ""Free"" [deleted] TIL 130 mil signing fee is fee Felix had a half decent year when they won the title, so it's not all bad I suspect there was a scam orchestrated by Mendez & insiders at Atletico. Maybe one day we’ll know what really happened there. His profile was pretty much the same as Griezmann so what are you even talking about. Atletico needed a creative attacking midfielder, they got one. De Light was just slightly not worthy the price but still a very solid transfer. I'd say Felix is the only undoubtably bad transfer there. De ligt was okay - sold for a 18m euro loss after 3 years. Martial also okay considering his injury issue and the rest are still young. ✅ I would say Martial did if you count ""the hype"" as being from the time in the graphic above. He really wasn't that hyped when the deal happened. The Martial hype that we remember came after his first season. Overall I think you'd take his career for the transfer fee. Not really crazy when you look at how most teenagers never really make it. The crazy thing is clubs gambling huge amounts on them. Martial may not have lived up to his potential, but if you consider injuries, he had a good career. Just a shame he got hindered so much by that. One of the top DM prospects in the world. Sadly for him he got injured, came back to play 32 min then got injured again. It was a gamble though. I remember his first season with us. Benzema was telling his mates not to pass the ball to him. But he was someone else in 2020 onward. These people didn't see him play for Benfica like we did. We've had tons of talented players coming from the academy over the years, Félix was by far the most special. And we’re probably going to sell them for €120mil apiece when their time comes. Thats mostly because there isn’t really much competition. Hes played like 3 friendlies for the Brazilian national team Follow the money. It wouldn't matter. That Monaco team was dismantled. Half  the initial 11 was gone the season Mabppe left and the other half was gone the next season after that.  I think the only good players left were Falcao and the Keeper. Follow the money. Maybe one day we’ll know. How many CL Felix got? - CR7 probably He'll come good for sure Why? He's 19, been at the club for half a season, under a coach who didnt want him. Give him a chance lol No, Mbappe looked much better [deleted] As many as he would have played for Liverpool How is Vini unsportsmanlike? He was fine at Southampton just got injured Didn’t they use the griezmann money In the leaked audios Florentino talks about Mendes and Porto's president fleecing Chelsea for Mourinho and Carvalho, and diverting some money for those transfers to an account in Swizterland.   https://youtu.be/yC-4WZJIN3c?si=rMoeioTLPiN5dkC8  13:29 in the video (but the entire thing is hilarious if you understand some spanish, which is likely if you're from Portugal).  Thats why Florentino doesnt want to do business with Mendes. Funniest thing is Mendes seems to be Barça working closely with Deco. Dude is a leech. Yup, this absolutely never comes close to happening without Mendes involved, certainly presume some shady stuff was involved because Atleti simply does not have them finances for this to make sense (and are generally pretty cheap)  edit: changed with -> without They sorted by potential on sofifa instead of actually watching him play, classic mistake. In the Europa League first leg against Frankfurt he looked like he could become a ballon d'or winner Tbf I was thinking he is the real deal. Looked really good for Benfica and very mature for his age.   Of course the transfer fee was outright dumb af and probably played a role in him bombing like a bitch. Benfica are the masters of extracting an over inflated fee he got a kidney injury in 2015 against bayer leverkusen where he was rushed to the hospital after the game. never allowed himself to recover and would piss blood after every game and training session. that plus depression and years of playing every game meant he was bound to fall off at some point He was still highly rated then but had a poor stint with Chelsea, which may not have all been his fault. He’s now a reserve at Atlético and that’s probably not going to change. Jesus I completely forgot he played for Chelsea. One of those transfers that happened and i’ve just for some reason erased it from my memory future rustic snails toothbrush encourage growth provide teeny hungry dime   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Honestly i felt like Aleti in recent years has been living off the brilliance of Simeone like United those final Ferguson years Neh even without hindsight, a lot of people were calling out the ridiculous fee at the time. The people who defended the move compared him to Griezzman and were sure Simeone would turn him into that type of player for some reason, which is weird because Simeone has only done it with Griezzman so it's not like he has a proven track record of that type of transformation. > Everyone talks about Barca splashing Neymar money on getting Griezzman  But nobody talks about this either, the Neymar money went into Coutinho and Dembele Well, thats cause atletico can actually register their players without needing to do some fraudlent moves like selling fraudulent studios llc to a ghost that will never pay the money. Griezmann joined Barca two whole years after they sold Neymar. Wasn't his agent complaining that he was subbed after 70 min not even 3 months after he arrived? That's a terrible move if you're the new guy, specially at atlético where the most important figure is Simeone. City would never go for Felix. Most of the money came from the grizeman sale iirc Did you forget Barca triggering Griezmann’s €120m clause right before To me the Spanish transfer I can't understand how they got the money was Betis making Denilson the most expensive player in the world. Don't remember them going big on transfers like that any other time I can barely imagine Benfica asking for that much in the first place. No clue why so many of our fans continue to defend him. He was a massive flop but at the end of the day, who cares? We got the money and that’s all that matters Why should Simeone be criticized for Félix flopping? He was injured in training camp, finally got to play, looked great, and then reinjured himself on his first match back What difference would it have made > still  I mean, it isn’t exactly controversial to have that opinion now Don't think add ons are included for the graphic, since Endrick is only listed at 47.5, when I think most stories said the total price was 60m. May be misremembering though Don't think any of the others include unrealised add ons. The idea that a lad who clearly isn't physically cut out for English football getting sent to Scotland to resurrect his career is wild Same as amad diallo, shane duffy, aaron ramsey, jon joe kenny, todd cantwell just to name a few prem players who came up and were utter dreadful He wasn't even good at porto Mendes did us some favours - Neves and Jota in the Championship, Moutinho for £5m - so this was our favour to him. Wolves sold out to Mendes and Mendes, like the devil, come to collect once in a while.  Like when we paid 10m for Bebe to get CR7 to sign an extension. We weren't Which is funny because I learned about Camavinga's existence thanks to the Wunderkind threads from here when he was still 16, been a FM legend for me up until we signed him, I don't think Zidane out of all people didn't knew about his existence back then.  And though yes, we have the pull, sometimes those moves don't work out as we saw with Ødegaard who took time and needed to leave to become amazing or with Reiner who we spent over 20m on him that just straight up didn't worked, so it's either securing a career or missing out on something you might never get back.  I wish we would use more canteranos though. >It is not like players like Rodrygo, Camavinga, Vini and others weren't on the radar of other clubs. It is the fact when Real Madrid comes calling.. Players responds.  The thread about Vinicius signing is 6yo old and you can go and read what it was said about the signing then and now, just like what was being said when Vinicius was universally called ""Reboticius""... Some hindsight talk this is. One of the few that was worth it. People make too much up about footballer inflation, Rooney wasn't a record breaking fee or even the highest that transfer window whereas Mbappe's is still the second highest fee paid ever! There is no way Rooney's payment would be anywhere near it if adjusted. Football inflation hasn’t accounted for a 6x increase in fees. Worth every penny Yeah, obviously this is with hindsight in mind. Definitely a risk what they did with him, but oh boy did it pay off massively Wish my club has that strategy. Not buying mid players and refuse to rebuild properly It's a good strategy. If it works, you get 10+ years of service and almost 4x the value back from transfer fees. Won't have to pay huge salaries at the start aswell. If it doesn't, Brazilian prodigies still have a resale value. Vinicius and Rodrygo have alot of promise and will garner a resale value. No one is giving up kn their career at 22. It’s even more a testament to Real Madrid’s development than their scouting.  Vinicius has gotten so much better.  Do you mean Reinier? He was signed for 25m, I think and he still part of the team. Probably won't make it at Madrid, though, that's true The Reinier transfer is weird even for brazilians no one rated him highly Yeah but it's still better than buying 160 million bums like hazard Pedri at $5mm has the chance to be the steal of the century Yeah I think that was the thought process actually. Because that transfer happened pretty quickly. One day there was rumour that atletico want's to sign him, the other day they bought him. While we're on the subject of high transfer fees. What happened to Lemar? And that huge cash certainly won't help Atleti in a bidding war for player. Everyone know you have vast sum of cold money and will jack up the price like crazy for every player you even have slight interest in. He clearly is talented, he just doesn't have the drive to play tbf  He looks like he can't be bothered and doesn't care whether he fails or not because he's already set for life Even if he did 127m for a 19 year old is beyond dumb. He had barely played over half a single season.  You spend 127m or a current world class player in their prime. Best academy in the world? Damn Too many failures along the way, he can still become just below world class but that wouldn’t justify the initial hype. Almost €2m a minute is impressive Bro replicated Arthur Melo's insane 22/23 season For real. People should stop clowning players who got injured for long. Lavia has time to grow and hope he comes stronger from his injury Exactly Yeah Ik but it's funny to banter chelsea  ‘Getting hurt’ is such a funny way to say being injured He's been injured all season, he may well still thrive at Chelsea once actually able to play TBf I am sure Chelsea planned on him playing more than 32 minutes considering Caciedo was ran into the ground and Enzo was playing injured for half the season. Yeah they have just refused to play him just for a laugh. It's a terrible model and he hasn't just been unlucky with injuries last season. >Caicedo is slowly emerging into a decent player  I know you're a scouser, but this comment just feels so satirical. Almost like you wrote it back in September.   Quite literally one of our best players for the last few months of the season, which just so happened to coincide with our best run of form.  You wont find many Chelsea fans unhappy with the Caicedo transfer now. He's an absolute gem, and still so young. Man, when you put it in that way ...  holy shit. Only most lol, couldn’t even do that right. Atleast he won a World cup when he was player at their club That's a big bidet Obviously they made a lot of money on him but for what he actually accomplished with them, it’s actually terrible transfer You can see the ability is there somewhere but it shows maybe 1 out of every 5 games. Very annoying Endrick was a done move long before Barca went in to sign Roque, the world doesn't revolve around you lol.   You don't see Barca fans saying you guys panic bought Guler cause we wanted him even though that makes a lot more sense and is accurate. Roque is done most likely, there's an endless parade of hype Barcelona youngsters that amount to nothing. Lol martial was always a certified bum. Talented but shit attitude. He was never making it even if he had hamstrings of steel. Man U fans are something else Also PSG without Mbappe these years would’ve been terrible in Europe Madrid offered 200M with add ons. Crazy.. > Almost made it to a final.  They did make it to the 2020 final that they lost 0-1 to Munich. What do you mean almost made a final? They made a final in 2020. That's a very weird lie. Top 5 leagues only started once Messi transferred to PSG I think he can still bench a lot of world class CB's but he just kidna fucked up by going to bayern imo. I think we all thought he was gonna have a guaranteed spot there but his injuries plus bad relations with coaches got him benched and his attitude didnt help. I mean real didn’t give money to psg so no transfer fee= free in that sense obv there’s a signing bonus that goes straight to Mbappe it's free in terms of what psg receives In PSG's eyes it's free. Think that was his point For PSG, he left on a free. It’s a free from PSG’s pov Yeah. But that's not going to go to PSG. Absolutely not. Félix is pure flair and creativity. Slow, no defensive contribution. Griezmann works his ass off. I don't know what Atlético were smoking. Wish he had stayed at Benfica. And he was amazing at Ajax, just didn’t really suite Juve’s style I’d say Martial is arguably the one on this list who is the farthest away from fulfilling his potential considering that he got Ballon d'Or potential shouts. At least the rest still have time to turn around their career. My god, i remembered it was trending and many wrote him off. Crazy what winning trophies change narratives. > keeper  Daniel Subasic I agree with you.. I stand corrected [yes they did](https://talksport.com/football/755184/wolves-signing-fabio-silva-from-porto-club-record-fee-raul-jimenez/) He dribbles and then smiles   Or scores and then *warning* dances Did you watch the CL final? Nah, Atleti used Griezmann, Lucas Hernandez and Rodri's money.  People tend to look at the money spend for Joao like Atleti splashed money that year. In reality the net spend was +70 millions that window after buying Llorente, Joao, Felipe, Lodi Trippier and Hermoso.  The thieves that own Atleti will never spend money on the team. terrible use of that money. at least it got us to win la liga tho All agents are leeches. The only difference between them is their size and how criminal they are.   And apart from being financial criminals, a lot of them are directly or indirectly involved with organised crime gangs.  They need to be completely banned or at the very least very heavy regulated with everything they do made public. They had just sold Griezmann, Hernandez and Rodri for 250m€ Atleti sold for players for 310 millions that window.     And yes, they were cheap even buying Joao. The net spend was +70 millions after buying half a team. A lot of players have singular games where they look that good but you need consistent performances of that level to warrant a fee that large. And he indeed won the Golden Boy which is like the kids version of Ballon d'Or Yeah, playing against a Frankfurt down to 10-men since minute 20.  They still managed to lose that tie and João Félix was completely neutered in the 2nd leg. He failed at Porto academy, he stayed at Benfica for 4 years.  Sure had a good half a season, but c'mon, can't spend that amount for half a season of europa league. In the year he had that sensational Frankfurt game he wasn't even the best goal scorer of Benfica..Seferovic was. It's not really about extracting, we just don't have the need to sell and put high release clauses on our players  Everyone is looking for that unicorn before everyone else gets him, and for teams like Atletico the only chance is to overpay massively and take a gamble, otherwise they risk having teams of higher status pick up the player later  Same thing happened with Enzo, Chelsea offered ridiculous values in the Winter market because if they waited they might've had competition and lost him  It's a dumb business model and I wish it didn't exist either, I'm tired of never keeping our talented players for more than a season, hopefully Neves actually stays this year Oh fuck. I know he has some injury back then but damn, I don't even imagine it to be THAT bad. Can't really blame him for his performance drop then. That’s scary af I don’t think that was it, cause I remember that was like his breakout campaign with that amazing solo goal against Bayern happening in 2016 when Atletí got to the final. His fall off came after that He’s already been told he’s not in the plans for next season iirc Yeah and I talk about them all the time when worst transfers ever comes up in conversation. For a long time coutinho was my pick, although Anthony is up there now. Or “swapping” players like Arthur/Pjanic/Neto/Cilessen I did actually. What a crazy time for transfers Because he spent €127m on a player that flopped? Oh no! Such a situation must have weighed him down so much. I mean, Liverpool isn’t Real Madrid but you can see in this chart that the hit rate for some clubs is much better than others. There is probably a reason for that. RM for example makes their youngsters sit and build muscle for a while before they get a chance to I mean butterfly effect would probably mean he wouldn’t get injured for the whole season I mean hey maybe he's happy with the money, idk Endrick was 35 + 25 with half of the add ons depending on how he does for Palmeiras (games, goals, trophies etc.) and half for Madrid (Golden Boy and Ballon d'Or + the earlier). He activated every clause for Palmeiras, so the current price is 47,5 They’re included for Martial. Same with Roque, reported with addons more than 60M The Martial one is even including the Ballon'dor clause in this... His physicality wasn’t an issue, he just wasn’t very good. Joey Barton was of my favourite ones to watch crash and burn when he came up here saying he’d boss the league etc lol couldn’t happen to a worse human being. Idk what happened with Diallo in Scotland  He did great for Sunderland in the Championship and physicality hasn't been an issue in the appearances he made for United this season. Ramsey was fine when fit (except that penalty), and Cantwell isn’t dreadful just hugely overrated And what a favor he did to himself, of the 40M we only got 25M. Apparently we had to give him some part of Fabio's rights for him to renew. So Mendes had a piece of the pie and it was in his best interest to inflate the value as much as possible. CR7 already left when Bebe was signed. The theory behind his signing was it's a ""thank you"" gift to Carlos Quieroz for helping Nani avoid drug test before the 2010 World Cup. Now that's a name I haven't heard in ages, he's up there with Obertan and Macheda Of course some don't work out, all 3 Brazilians were gambles, two out of three being world class is more than enough.   Saying Odegaard didn't work out when you get 35M for a 3M 16 year old is also disingenuous. As good as he was we've seen plenty of hyped 16 year old amount to nothing. Yeah. But this failed for Reiner.  I don't think he will get even a 5M bid now. If it works you look like Real Madrid, if it doesn't you get constantly clowned like Chelsea. I think part of that is on him though. He got put into the spotlight and got a ton of criticism and was able to grow from it. Many other players would just crumble under that kind of pressure That's a good point, and also a reason why it's sometimes better not to send players out on loan. Fans often see young players get zero minutes and just assume that going on loan is the best option, but even if they don't play, spending day in day out training with the first team is super valuable. None of his loan moves seemed to ever work out for him? Is he truly just shit, or is it an attitude problem? Yeah I think that's the guy - I forgot his name. And transfermarkt have it at 30m euros Wasn’t Lucas Silva and Tobias make the list too? He was the best player on his age group and a good squad piece at age 17 for Flamengo, the kid was really good and had/has big potential, but he's on the same boat that Gabriel Barbosa is, his main position doesn't exist for European football. I wonder if he had the same agent as either of the other two. Sounds strange Well he wasn't a bum when they spent 160m on him Injuries. Man is a brilliant player who can't stay fit. Lemaradona is injured.  He's a key player when fit. His injuy record also didn’t help. Felt like every time he would hit a good stretch of form for Atleti, in which he really looked like he was living up to his potential, he would get injured soon after and need a lot of time to regain his form, or even just his minutes. Maybe it also affected his attitude and motivation. I mean Benficas academy has been the most profitable in the world for some time now. In the last ~10 years I would classify the following Benfica academy products as very good or elite: Bernardo Silva, Florentino Luís, João Félix, João Cancelo, Gedson Fernandes, Rúben Dias, Gonçalo Ramos, Renato Sanches, João Neves, António Silva, Gonçalo Guedes, Jota and Ricardo Horta.  Then we also had a good number of second tier talents: Tomás Araújo, Tiago Gouveia, Paulo Bernardo, Tomás Tavares, Nuno Tavares, Hélder Costa, Ivan Cavaleiro, André Horta, Fábio Cardoso, etc. Many of these had good careers in top5 leagues or big clubs from smaller leagues.  Not sure if “best”, top3 or wtv, but definitely up there. Benfica having one of the absolute best academies is surely just a widely accepted fact?   Them, Barcelona, River Plate, Ajax etc etc so he's a *really* expensive prostitute been Injured Doubtful. Chelsea have plenty of other options in Lavia's position, and that's before they inevitably buy new players for the coming season. Nah I wrote it now, and as I previously said, he's slowly emerged into a decent player. It took him half a season but he's getting there. After Cole he's definitely been the most influential player for yous, and while I don't think he is or will ever be worth 120 I do see a bright future for the lad, and you stole Palmer so swings and roundabouts I guess.   Lavia is a headscratcher, though. Still not seeing Enzo's pricetag either yeah definitely the worst transfer on there, spent more than half a billion to win what they would have already won anyway, be just as mediocre in the champions league as before, not to mention those rafaeles that qatar bought from france to persuade macron to persuade mbappe to stay Calling him done after half a season in Europé in which he wasn't even given a proper chance isn't fair. Nor is using failed youngsters against him fair either when we have countless who made it. >Roque is done most likely  Said the Nostradamus, that didn't watch 1 minute of Vitor Roque playing, to come to that conclusion. LOL. The guy was talented but injury prone. Wheres the lie? They would have just bought somebody else, so that's not how it works imo They were terrible even with him Getting eliminated in the round of 16 or 8 most of the time while being pot 1 with a 1 billion team, is not a good performance Have they been good?   It's PSG. It's win the final, or it's a failure.   Mbappe has gotten them nothing that they couldn't have gotten without him. By didn't cut any losses I mean this past transfer window. They could have got something for him, it just wouldn't be enough to get someone better for one year You must be very young if you dont remember every record being titled ""in the top 4 leagues"". You cant be serious psg had already reached a CL final before that lol Yeah but it’s not a free from real Ballon d’Or shouts as an argument? It’s outrageous to call that for a teenager, no matter how good he is. Saying he’s far away from fulfilling potential when he’s been very injury prone and still having scored 90 goals is a wild take. Respect! But I mean... 40M on an unproven (in europe atleast) teenager, for a club who are in deep financial trouble... Doesn't look good haha, so you were definitely on to something. But lets see how he develops Winning the league after losing those caliber of players is a seriously insane achievement. That’s why Atleti can’t compete as of late Four** lil bro He looked amazing at Benfica and in the academy. He surely was exceptional. He is the living proof thats not the case Aye like mudryk for example Sure but you’re taking the bet that he can grow to do that consistently, if you waited on young guys until they were already fully proven the fee would be astronomically larger. Look at the list of golden boys winner and tell me it's even comparable to Ballon dor in this context That’s true but during that „era” every team was looking for his „Ronaldo/Messi” type of wonder, and Felix suited that scenario in that moment. Chelsea says hold my beer If you kept thinking like that then you would sit back and miss out on all the other wonderkids like vini rodrygo endrick haaland bellingham wirtz musiala. I'm sure you laughed at dortmund spending on some league 1-2 kid too but look at the profit they made Portuguese teams finessing other teams kinda crazy he didn’t fall off then. he kept playing thru that kidney injury for years which eventually led to his decline Hazard was worse if you include his wages, but Florentino runs a tight ship so Madrid could afford to lose that money without affecting their finances. ""QUIEN ES DOUGLAS?"" Lives rent free in my head, I swear to this day I still don't know what he looks like. Ah, the ""take a new credit card to pay the old one"" strategy And it wasn't just Griezmann either. Atlético also got 70 and 80 mil by selling Rodri and Hernández earlier that summer. It was the board's decision not him. He was literally hurt the whole time it’s not like when he played he looked bad he can’t even get fit He has literally been injured. Unfair to judge he’s on about 70k a week while he was on about 38k at Southampton. He most likely would’ve been on the same money at Liverpool From a Man Utd fan no less… >He activated every clause for Palmeiras  He's so fucking good. Please take care of him 😭 There is also the tax Wasn't Martials total fee was up to roughly 80m Euros though right? this is 60m euros not GBP.  from a reddit thread at the time of the transfer: ""Confirmed Fee: €50m(£36m), plus €30m addons"" You could tell he was technically very good. But he never seemed to make a big impact on games. Felt the same about Lammers, who then seemed to score goals for fun when we loaned him out, though maybe that was our fault for not playing him as an outright striker.  Going back to Silva, feel he has to really up his off the ball movement if he's going to be a success through the middle. And if he wants to be a success on the wing he needs to up his defensive work rate. Tbf I think it's both He was bullied at celtic park and was subbed at half time. 10M went to Silva's dad.  He's effectively costing us £7M per year with amortization, we need to convince some poor fool to spend more than that this summer so we can get rid of the stroppy little child for good Pretty sure Fergie never saw any footage of him either when we signed him. At least Macheda gave us *that* goal against Villa It's a drop in a bucket for a big club. There's no transfer strategy that warrants a 100% success rate. I'd argue what hurts the Reinier value is that he's not an out and out forward or an out and out midfielder. Clubs don't take risks on those sort of players because most teams do not employ formations suited to those players. Reiner… right here, right NOW?? The good thing is that you don't need every single one to hit for that policy to succeed. Whereas buying older established stars at high prices, you really want them all to meet expectations. Reiner flopping is easier to deal with than Hazard flopping. Chelsea throwing them out on loan so that other teams develop them for them is what's wrong with their approach. How many do they have on loan across the entire European continent? Exactly, I’d rather have Guler and Endrick learn from Modrić and Mbappe/ Vini than go out on loan at any other club. Someone who watched him more closely in Brazil can correct me if I'm wrong, but apparently for Flamengo, he excelled in a role that doesn't really exist in Europe (or at least no team has deemed him good enough to give him the same role) and hasn't been able to adapt. He's very talented, with words saying he's actually much more talented than Vini and Rodrygo and was very mature. But he couldn't make that next step from Brazil to Europe.  Part of that is our fault. He played for Castilla (our youth team) for a bit and he looked good. Then we loaned him out to Dortmund of all places who refused to give him much play time (idk if it was because he was a loan player or if he was just shit) and then he proceeded to rot on the bench instead of us recalling him and sending him out. When his loan finally ended, we then loaned him out somewhere else and he still didn't play that much football.   Compare that to Vini and Rodrygo who played in the youth team then got minutes in the first team Silva was bought back in 2015 or 16 for under 15m. He was always a punt but it didn't work for a lot of reasons (health being a factor too). Tobias was on loan in Castilla for 2 years but he's going back to Shaktar now. Both didn't work out but neither was a heavy investment tbh What position/role is is that? That's hardly the issue with Gabigol If people are gonna mention the risk of 18 yr old signings, might aswell also mention how the other strategy of buying a slightly older proven forward at 28y for 4x that value turned into. Also, Jovic who had done it in Europe and if you went by conventional thought process would be preferred because he was already performing in Europe ahead of those Brazilians. He is never worth that price. While their academy is great and certainly one of the best in the world. Being the most profitable doesn't make it the best as teams like Barca have incredible academies, but just don't sell the players who come out of it nearly as often. It's even debatable if it's the best of Portugal...  The national team spine is still Sporting If you last longer than 10s. Well most of the money went to the former pimp though It’s always a Liverpool fan who has to pipe up about Lavia.   I’m interested to see what does happen if he ever gets to fitness. He has that connection with Maresca from the City PL2 squad and seems ideal for the deep lying playmaker the Maresca system uses.   He will have plenty of minutes rotating with Enzo and Caicedo. Plus we’ve not been linked with any CMs > Chelsea have plenty of other options in Lavia's position  Who pray tell? Covid league final Yes but in terms of signings that this post is about he is moving on a free.   In future threads where this topic comes up it is not a 130M transfer is it? If it were then all the numbers would need to be adjusted similarly.  It’s a free transfer. Yea. Not free for Real.  But he is leaving for free from PSG after they spent 180M for him when he was a teenager. Oh My God, everyone knows that, why are you guys making it such a big deal? lmao. So antagonist for no reason lol I mean, what are we discussing here? Ask any United fan, they'd feel pretty underwhelmed with Martial's career at United compared to his initial hype. The 60M pricetag shown here is also inclusive of all add-ons, most of which I'm sure he did not accomplish. He's far from a bad signing despite how everything turned out. Especially when you look at how much we've spent on Antony, Sancho, Maguire and Casemiro since. Yes it was.  The key factor for that title was having players with a massive chip on his shoulder all at once. People like Llorente, Trippier, Carrasco and Suárez gave his 100% and something more that season. They like chollonges I heard Academy? Bro. well thats just being pedantic innit? A team could pay 120m for a 2nd division player, doesn't mean the player is 120m quality. Just that the team was willing to pay that much who knows why. Which part? Than 127 million euros? Back then?    Bellingham cost less ffs  Remember this was in 2019, Eden hazard and Antoine griezmann were sold in the same window for less money than Felix. Even if he had become world class he still might not have fetched the same fee they paid for him. Not in his case. The fee already was astronomically large And during that era it was hip to Shell out ridiculous sums and get nothing in return So many bad examples, none of those had a 120M first transfer, especially after failing before and get a free transfer just 3 years before.  Haaland was bought by... 8M, then 20M, then 60M  Bellingham was bought by 30M...  Wirtz 200k  Musiala 200k  All of them have proved something after this transfer, way more than Félix in his half a season where he only played one game in Champions league... People gonna disagree with me just cause of the flair and all but Hazard was definitely a worse signing on paper and as a player. Although overall I would say Coutinho was worse cause it was a big part in leading our club to financial crisis Kerlon, Henrique, even Paulinho were shady deals Infinite money! Yeah I’m sure he had zero say or sway Takes one to know one eh How do u rate Willian? Interested to know That's bs, it was nowhere close to 80. There were 3 add-ons. League goals, caps for France, and the Ballon d’Or. I've just looked at that dude's numbers, and in conclusion, it's fair to say he should never have left the Netherlands It's amazing how top football clubs are essentially held together by a few bits of string. Like Roy Hodgson accidentally selling Alex Kačaniklić to Fulham as part of the Konchesky deal, when he thought he'd Alex Cooper. And nobody thought to check! Yup. And he hasn't been successful in his loan spells too as he would have to change his style of play to accommodate to most. But teenagers are orders of magnitude riskier, it kind of feels insane that Vinicius hadn't even had first team minutes and Madrid had already bought him, hindsight can tell us they were incredibly lucky.  Looking at the list, there's more flops than hits, even if we're being generous and we assume the jury is still out on a couple of them (De Ligt, Roque). Are we really doing this?! A loan to Arsenal? Wouldn't be the worst of the ideas tbh. There was Lucas Silva too Yeah thats true.  But if it's a big signing like Mbappe or sort, it won't be bad even if it's a flop after high profile signing. He is gonna get back the amount in less than a year. But Hazard wasn't exactly that either. Still weird to think that Real spend 100M and put up very easy clauses (rather than performance based) for a Hazard who had like 1 year left in his contract. Not many since Boehly took over Also someone can correct me on this if it's bs, but I swear I read somewhere when the club decided to send him to another club on loan after his failed 1st season at Dortmund, he refused to do so and wanted to stay. Even his loan to Girona was his choice. So I really don't know what is going on and how much blame is on him. I wish him the best but it seems like he's going back to Brazil, he just might not be built for European football. Reinier is done too I guess? He can’t make the squad I believe. How are players like Paz and the Puerto Rican dude? He's a second striker, he needs that freedom to roam around and be as close to the ball as he can to be able to play it well  He's not good enough to make anyone change their system to fit him, could see him working out on that Firmino role, but I wouldn't expect it About 50% of transfers work out. But when you consider potential development that amount drops further. 18 year old vini was terrible, took him a little while to grow into the player he is today. When you look at all the griezzman, dembele, Felix & Coutinho transfers around that time he certainly was. Not good for me then 10 seconds would still be €333k so still extremely expensive Thats not the point but I see youre not a logical being so have a nice day I replied to a comment that doesn’t mention transfer. That’s what I’m pointing out. It’s not free You’re the one getting annoyed by a simple comment lol Yeah, in the Benfica youth squads. What do you call it in English? >you need consistent performances of that level to warrant a fee that large. Hazard on paper was an absolutely fantastic signing though   He was in his prime   Had a remarkable season and was primed to be the star at real.   It turned out to be awful but on paper it was going to be great At least paulinho was decent on the pitch I miss Paulinho he was actually good If you want to have a dig at Cholo it's fine, it's just not that way to do it. There is a club hierarchy to make decisions like that, Cholo is neither the chief scout, the sporting director, the club president nor the club owner. Bro please stop embarrassing us Do you mean Estevão? Because he goes by the first name here haha. He just turned 17 and he looks more ready than Endrick was at this point last year. Endrick was sacked from the starting eleven deservedly so and only came back doing what we imagined he was capable of at the end of the season. Meanwhile Estevão has been playing minutes regularly since april and going really well. He plays a bit further away from the goal, but he creates a lot of opportunities for himself and others. I think he has a bright future ahead and hope he does really well, but I think Endrick is more Europe ready because he's built like a tank, Estevão is really skinny and will need to gain some muscle for sure. well feel free to prove it, everything from the time says 50+30. I wasn't saying the addons weren't a thing either lol.  like it was famously repeated that he was an 80m transfer (unfairly including the addons) this isn't new ground.  It was literally confirmed by the VP of Monaco. The exchange rate in 2015 matches up with that figure.  https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9976968/manchester-united-trebled-offer-for-anthony-martial-within-a-week moral of the story - don't buy hype players from Netherlands league - Antony, Bergwijn... I hope he comes back to Flamengo on this mid year tranfers window. Some rumours, begun last month, that our VP of football was looking for a 1 year loan.  He seemed so talented when he played for us, that i still believe he can make a good career on Flamengo.  But you're right, he shined as a second attacker, which is a position that european clubs don't use at all. And with Jorge Jesus, that seems to make mid players, play above of what they're used to do. I hope that Tite can do that too. It was more a reference from Attack on titan I think haha 1 year left thing meant nothing, because Hazard was going to renew if Madrid didn't offer fair price to Chelsea. Also Hazard was a fantastic signing at that point. A big thing for us is that we treated him differently to Vini and Rodrygo. When he wasn't getting minutes at Dortmund we should have immediately pulled the plug and brought him back and sent him somewhere else. But instead he stuck with keeping him there public tap touch noxious far-flung fanatical tart plough important straight   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* What is Reiniers’ position? I guess you were talking Barbosa? He wasn't terrible. What the fuck? If Real Madrid would've not went for him, some other club would've for more than that. He was not plucked out of obscurity, Real Madrid just moved in faster and had the prestige that others didn't. Vinicius had 3.87 dribbles p/90 in his first season and was the main creator and driver of attacks under Solari. ""Terrible"", I don't think you saw any Vinicius in his first years. No need to feel shameful. Just enjoy those 6 sec To Donald Trump it wouldn’t be Well no player plays for free. So it’s a strange thing to point out. If someone moves from Düsseldorf to St. Pauli at the end of their contract no one says well actually it costs X.  Madrid out bid everyone on wages same as every other similar transfer aha Lots of players are fantastic in the academy but can't take the next step. Felix was an overpay, with and without retrospect  Thay don't. Who needs an academy if you can be last in the league and still have like 60mln for transfers Maybe I should have said deserve not warrant Is a hotdog valued at $15 if one idiot buys one? No “Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev has revealed Manchester United almost trebled their offer for Anthony Martial within a week, and has confirmed that the total value of the transfer could reach nearly £58m” where is 80 coming from????😂 Suarez... It's not like psv bought him. He left because his loan there ended Yeah. I also think it's good he goes back to flamengo. I don't think a loan would be possible now though as he has 1 year left on his contract iirc. Oh. My bad. Spending 100M on hazard with 1 year left was bongers. A 70 M was the ideal price for him with hard to get performance based add-ons. Hazard was also 29 at the time, not 25 or younger.  We wouldn't be talking about this if it didn't became the worst signing maybe in the history of club football, but that signing was going in the wrong manner from the beginning. Thank you for the correction, much appreciated! Did you see him play for Real Madrid? Benzema famously said how Vinicius was playing against them. I’m not saying he wasn’t a hot talent, but if he was still as good as he was back then he would be on loan somewhere. He developed, that’s the point. Not everyone does & it’s hard to predict who will develop well That’ll be 200k please It’s not strange. I’m just clarifying the situation He was a similar buy to vini rodrygo endrick martial, and dare i say mbappe from monaco to psg. They all had at most one successful top flight season and then were scooped up at a high price. He just ended up not being a success, which is the assumed risk when clubs make these gambles. It was an overpay, yes, but at the time it made some sense because he looked like he could become as good as kaka/hazard in his position Not without retrospect, we could just as easily be talking about it having paid off, nowadays Coming from a Chelsea fan you know that it’s a serious overpay.. But a large part of any fee for a young player is potential. Clearly he hasn't proven value for money but that is in part due to him failing to reach that potential. Did he have enough potential to warrant that fee? I don't think so but others seem to. Ironic coming from someone with a Wrexham flair. I mean yeah that’s how the market works. If people are buying it for a price, that’s what it’s worth? Otherwise what’s your threshold? 2 idiots? 10? Have you even been to a sporting event? Do you not understand what exchange rates are? are you really that stupid? The euro to gbp rate has changed since 2015... 80 is in euros as well (the chart being discussed is in euros)  to be clear for you seeing as you're slow, in 2015;  £36m is roughly 50m euros initially £58m is roughly 80m euros total Ronaldo Nazário, R9 Madrid could have offered 70M but Chelsea simply wouldn't have sold him. And Madrid desperately needed a leader for the attack after the disaster of 2018-19 and nobody could have predicted that Benzema would go on to become that leader. I have seen Vinicius and Real Madrid in every game for the last 5 years. He was already the full package in the things you can't learn and just needed improvements in finishing which is the aspect most tricky dribblers are not good at from the start. Benzema's comments prove nothing other than a mid-game frustration.    What was wrong with Vinicius was the system and Zidane wanting to limit his freedom and creativity because he was more pragmatic and wanted the team defensively assure. Did you know Zidane started Vinicius at RWB against Chelsea in one of his final games? It took a month with Carlo Ancelotti for Vinicius to start registering upwards of 20G and 20 assists and it's not because he learnt that shit in a month. Few tactical tweaks, telling him what runs to make, playing him a little closer to the goal, giving him confidence to use his dribbling ability to create havoc and Vinicius was off to the racers. But we’re talking about transfer fees in this thread all the way, not wages etc… and your comment was ‘it’s not a free from Real’.  Which in terms of transfer frees etc it is definitely a free, everyone understands Real aren’t getting Mbappe for free in totality, which is why I say it was a strange thing to point out.  Maybe we’re just misunderstanding eachother which is fine, hope you’re having a good night! Vini, Rosrygo, Endrick were like 1/3 his price. I agree Joao would be reasonable buy at that price, even a steal when you take potential into account. Similar with Martial who was bit of an overpay but still less than half of Joao.  I dont buy comparison to Mbappe. Mbappe was different than anyone mentioned here, even if he never improved on his Monaco season he would be a good deal for PSG. It was just an incredibly poor piece of business by Atletico, because he is such a wildly different type of player than what they had their team built upon.   It's like they thought about reinventing the club's philosophy / identity but pulled out half way through. The Felix that came out of Benfica could hardly find a worse top tier club to develop into an established top tier player. Da fak has a fair to do with this? If you prefere I can have a Botafogo one or something else. I just love how people here, when having nothing to say, go with ""ironic with a flair like that"" Eh. If I'm selling hotdogs and one dude pays $15 but nobody else is paying close to that then the value of my hotdogs aren't $15. I can overpay for whatever but if I can only sell it for less... Chelsea would have sold him for 70-80. And there was no need to add ridiculously simple clauses on top of that. And Benzema wasn't bad in the 18/19 season iirc. Had 40 G+A or something.  The point is he was not a greatly marketable star, had 1 year left in his contract, and was 29 years old. That was 3 red flags for a 100M offer. But Perez wanted him here and you know what happens if Perez wants a thing. Okay seems I touched a nerve. The point is you buy young players for their potential, not who they are today. And they don’t all reach that potential. That’s a risk. I replied to a person not talking about transfers. If Chelsea would have sold him for that, then Madrid wouldn't offer more ya know? And it was hard to guess Benzema would continue his form because that came after two very poor seasons. It was simply that Chelsea had more bargaining power in that situation because Hazard was willing to extend contract with them.     What madrid could have done I guess is look for other players too instead of going all in on Hazard. But at that point Hazard was looking like a balon-d-or winner level player, so Madrid took the chance. But none could have guessed it would go down as the worst transfer ever.   If you wanna talk about red flag transfer, then it was more the Jovic one. A player who only performed for one season and before that failed in his previous club was signed with a huge salary. Rumor wise he was getting paid more or on par with Benzema. My man the person you replied to said ‘he’s leaving on a free (transfer) in his prime’.  You said, it’s not free Real are paying 130M.  I have previously explained twice that maybe you didn’t know the (transfer) part, so I added in and told you.   I can not explain it any simpler than that. The entire thread is about transfers. Chelsea would have sold but hazard himself wanted a higher package for his club. Madrid does that.  Jovic was also a big red flag. Just came into the scene and he was bought unlike the recent young signings who were touted become top players from their young days itself. You literally just added transfer lol. Even you know I’m right and you’re just changing the statements Not really No im trying to say that want the person meant was a free transfer, which I explained with my replies.  You know what dude, I retract my good night, I hope you are just having an average night 😂😂😂 what a nuissance! Yes, really. No you’re changing what they said to fit something that you’re thinking. You’re just adding stuff to create confusion lol No. Not really Yes, the entire thread is literally about transfers.

Mental that he's still only 24. This guy is a prime waffler when it comes to Manchester United. He knows nothing. Pletti suffering from withdrawal for not linking us to De Ligt again.   Hopefully he gets the help he needs ASAP. I wish there was a site that tracked journalists by the transfer stories they claim to have news on so we could really see who the bullshit merchants are as this dude seems to be one of them.  If I wa smart enough to create such a thing I would, unfirtunately I am dumb  It must in theory be possible to have a bot track each football journalists profiles and their tweets using keywords to catergorize by context of the tweet and then score the tweet on a weighted scale of accuracy? If this made any sense, I don't know what the technical terms are for what I mean lol Same guy who had absolutely no clue about Olise and Ito, he doesn't know shit about Bayern and I doubt it's different when it comes to ManU. Seems like he's been around forever, I didn't realise he was only 24. Nooo. I thought he’d stay at bayern for life 50 only? They could get much more for him There's absolutely no way INEOS come in and take on his mental wages in their first window when they're so obviously trying to fix the mistakes of the past like the wage structure. It's an easy link. He knows nothing but keeps repeating the same shit every day.  Dutch player who played for United's manager at his old club and United was interested in him when he went to Juve. That's an easy link. Notice how he was like 3 days late on Olise but keeps doubling down on Tah & De Ligt.   The player has to agree to a transfer as much as the club and I don't think taking a pay cut to play in Europa League would be enticing for him. Honestly I think this would actually be a good signing for Ten Hag compared to pretty much any he’s done for Man Utd.  But the wages and such seems against the standard the new owners want to set. Then again they will have to bend a little to attract top talent as most other clubs do Crazy to think of his trajectory so far, during that Ajax champions league run he looked like a top contender for top CB in the future.  He still got time to improve but wild that he is about to join a 3rd team different team since then thank you mister Kim with your infinite knowledge He was 17 when he played for us in the EL final against United. He's not really leaving those teams because he's bad. Leaving Juventus was on his own volition and Bayern signed him on a relatively ridiculous wage and kept stacking their squad with prime CB real estate. He still is. He’s just 24. He did well at Juve he was just to expensive for them. And now at Bayern he’s done great as well. Just that Bayern seek to cut their finances. So he also became to expensive. If he goes to a team that does not care about his salary and bonuses he’d probably never be sold again unless he wants to leave. He is very good though and most Bayern fans don't want him to leave. Seems to be some sort of wage balancing move by them. For 50M it should be an instant buy for any rich club looking for a CB and no issues with wages.  edit: Just realized that United value him at 50M. Bayern might not agree. I wouldn't say about to, this fella hasn't got a clue when it comes to United I believe he prefers to be called ""Supreme Leader"" I never meant to imply he is leaving because he is bad. Im just bewildered because finding a CB that good, in such a young age is a gold mine for any team. I expected him to make the big move and stay with a team for years and reach his potential.  With 20/20 hindsight, choosingJuventus mighta been a mistake, but Bayern are the ones screwing up here by letting go of a solid defender. Juventus was the wrong move in hindsight with their collapse in mind.   The problem De Ligt has is that he's on a extraordinary wage for a centreback. This was true for Juventus and for Bayern. He is a top 25 centreback in the world, but he's not going to win you titles on his own like Van Dijk. So when you need space in your wage structure it is really alluring to sell your relatively young star CB that's wanted by any topclub needing someone for that position.  De Ligt's curse is that he's really good, just barely not good enough. If he was worse, he'd probably stay, if he was better, they'd never want to sell him. Oh we know lol. I don't understand why we are doing this.  He's so good. And Kim too. But they play a few bad games and suddenly it's lights out. But upamecano gets one million chances to get another red or give away a penalty.  Make it make sense. What are you talking about? Upamecano gets a lot of stick for his mistakes by Bayern fans. In fact, he is the only one out of these 3 where they don't delude themselves that he is world class despite only one season at that level at 27 years old (Kim) or because of his potential from 5 years ago even though no coach really rates him that much (De Ligt)."

How have they bought an expensive CB every summer in the last 5 years and somehow Eric Dier seemed to be their most consistent CB in the UCL semis. whatever happened with Tolisso? seems like such a forgettable player thought the kane transfer was a bit more than that How has Kim been? Im hearing different things. Wasn’t Mané €41 million?  That’s what everyone reported. Hope Olise stays healthy. 🤞🏼🍀 And only 2 of those really had an impact 😬 Simons will be the 2nd highest (inshallah) Inflation is quite real Abit more hit and miss than i would thought bayern got their best players for cheap apparently He’s worth double that, will earn every penny of that fee over the next five years for Bayern! As someone who follows all transfers of major leagues and teams, its still always surprising seeing a team like bayern have so many ""cheap"" players in their top 10. Watching premier league transfer sagas completely polluted my mind.  But thats also somewhat reassuring knowing that if Bayern actually went for Wirtz, it would be special circumstances even for them. How do palace fans feel about that? It seems quite low compared to what they’d have to spend to replace him? Haven't been actively watching football for a long time now, and it feels so strange to see those numbers. I remember that back when I was a big fan the Roy Makaay transfer was the biggest thing ever. Apparently isn't even near the Top 10 anymore nowadays. Makes me feel really old. Worth it. Will Harry Kane ever win a Championship with any team? [deleted] What a list of flops. See this? All their expensive transfers are coming from outside the Bundesliga with Upamecano as an exception. They are penny pinchers when it comes to Bundesliga transfers Quite the lot of disappointing transfers.  For Bayern fans: find the ones who got sent off against Real Madrid in the CL knockout stages. Martinez was so incredibly good. Such a shame that his body couldnt hold up, one of my favourite players to watch ever. So dynamic and clever, not just the great defender he was later in his career. [deleted] adjusted for inflation he is also the 4th most expensive          if transfermarkt did not already do that I remember when it was announced. Most expensive Bundesliga signing up to that point Exactly this.  I remember being over the moon when that was announced despite the at-the-time grandiose fee.    Martinez was so under-rated.  I think a lot of that came from the fact that he couldn't get a minute for Spain, only because All-Universe Busquets existed at the same time.  Kinda similar situation with Zubimendi being in the shadows of Rodri, the best six in the game.  That's all to say, I rather have Zubimendi over Palhinha for a variety of reasons.  Don't get me wrong, Palhinha is a great player and Bayern would be fortunate to have him.  Just think that for the money, I rather have the younger, higher ceiling player in Zubimendi.  I understand that they want the UCL title at home in 2025 and Palhinha represents an immediate improvement.  But beyond, I think they are better served with Zubimendi being a fixture for five to six years.    When in doubt, buy both!  They can always sell something to Saudi! [deleted] [deleted] He was probably the only one Tuchel talked to or acknowledged. Actually, Tuchel personally played the trombone outside of all the other CBs' houses at night so his EPL darling Eric Dier would stand out ""The Dier Effect"". The Man City special Made of glass Believe me, I will never forget Tolisso. Should have by all rights been the one carrying the french and Bayern midfield for a decade if not for injuries. Another good player whose entire career ruined by injuries fifa 16/17 career mode legend went back to OL Hes playing in OL Best scene of him was his celebration of Pavard's goal against Argentina. Depends on who you believe. Tottenham journalists say £100m + £20m in addons. Bayern journalists say 80m Euros plus 20m in addons. It was. This image was made by a Bayern fan.  E: LMFAO these bayern fans Started amazing, struggled in the 2nd half and lost his starter spot to Dier. 'twas 32m€ guaranteed + 9m€ potential Bonus. They sold Mane at a profit to Saudi Arabia too. The whole thing was so weird. Not to mention him being an open and proud child groomer. His injury crisis was massively overblown, mainly down to roy/the med staff trying to rush him back cuz we really needed him Kane and Martinez? Olise,Coman,Gnabry,Musiala,Simons and Kane you are stacked which 4 players will be play. 100% not this year. at most loan + obligation I am so unsure about simons. At first I thought he is brilliant but hogging the ball a bit too much instead of passing. But currently in the dutch team he is really good at setting up his teammates but utterly abyssmal at finishing. He genuinely reminds me of havertz the way he plays right now. Very active player that constantly creates value for the team but you gotta hope he isnt the one receiving the ball in a good position because it will be wasted lol. And what about Palhinha? 4th? 5th? It was a release clause so nothing they can do about it unfortunately 50 mill was the release clause. Considering he had just won the title for Napoli and everyone was after him, it seemed like a steal. Still time to prove his worth Which players from within the Bundesliga has Bayern underpaid for in your opinion then?  The transfers of Upamecano, Hummels, Götze, Neuer, Gomez. would all be in the range of €43\~54m if today's inflation is taken into account.  Let's not forget that they've also paid a world record fee for a coach of about €20m to Leipzig for Nagelsmann.  Earlier this year, Hoeneß indicated they'd be willing to pay at least €100m for Wirtz once he's on the market.  Now imagine they didn't miss out on players like Bellingham, Haaland, Dembélé, De Bruyne, etc., people would again be complaining that Bayern buys players from their league rivals to weaken them. I'm pretty sure that BVB is also not disappointed that they don't have to play against their former best players and that those players chose to go to other European top clubs instead. He is my favourite Spanish player. He was such a class person too. Incredibly complete player. In his last season at Athletic he played as a ball playing centre back and was incredible, then at Bayern was arguably the best midfielder in the world during that treble winning season  I remember Pep playing him as a second striker against Klopp's Dortmund aswell as a target man to bypass the press. This guy was so unlucky that Busquets and Xabi Alonso were active at the same time For the price paid, Hernandez could probably get that shout.  He spent most of his first season injured, then Flick always preferred Davies - Alaba - Boateng - Pavard/Kimmich as his starting backline. Then in his second season he never really cemented himself as first choice left back or centre back, only getting a solid run after other players got injured. He had a decent first season under Nagelsmann and then spent most of his second season injured and then just left. Kind of an unremarkable ending to his time at the club; he was injured in November and then several months later he wasn't a Bayern player anymore.  In terms of impact, I'm not sure he had any. Warrior on the pitch but all things considered, he wasn't a fixture for long eniugh to have an impact in the way someone like Martinez did. Kim was great last season. One game where he was thrown in without any rhythm or confidence doesn't tell the whole story. He'll continue being a great player for us Zubimendi and Palhinha have very different profiles though, i wouldnt even classify Zubimendi as a six like Rodri; more of an 8. Idk if this is sarcasm but vidal wasnt even a skid on what Martinez did for Bayern.   Not to mention his shitty remark towards Bayern when he'd left for Barca right before they got gaped. Haha. I say that pic alone was worth It. [deleted] The better Hernandez ? lol Lucas “Cuphead” Hernandez Let Me Solo  Had an obligatory banger every year. Love him and miss him thats a massive difference wtf [deleted] 95 said by Hoeneß so it should be correct I think he was just over-played. He looked like a shadow of himself after the Asia Cup.   I expect him to return to his old self after the rest he's getting this summer. Got it - I’m assuming he didn’t hit a lot of those then, given his less than illustrious tenure in Bavaria. For Kane, it’s way too early to tell, sure an incredible first season comparable to Lewa but like I said it’s only been one season yet Coman and Gnabry will hopefully be sold, but in the case they stay they’ll be bottom of the list Tel as well i think its just low confidence. hes trying very hard to score because he hasnt yet I think. At club level he has the confidence for good finishing 4th I think 5th or 6th since it's around 50m Ohhh didn’t know that. Was there a lot of competition for him? He’s looked amazing last season and for that price I’d think everyone would want him They know the Bundesliga market very well and use it to their advantage. They know agents and contract details of every interesting player in the Bundesliga and poach them early.   They know exactly when to buy (if they buy).   The amount of free transfers they get from within the Bundesliga is incredible. They know exactly how to play their cards for these kind of transfers.   There's also a reason why every high profile target goes into other leagues - the clubs simply demand a price Bayern doesn't want to pay. That's why I am very comfortable about Wirtz. Hernandez was a great player, but injuries... its the same with tolliso he was not as far developed as hernadez was yet, but you could tell he had the ability to become a great player, if it werent for the Injuries  I still think getting rid of DeLigt is a Mistake but if Kim doesnt turn it around for now only Kane and Martinez have been really succesful from that list so far, Sane has been great but incosistent Oh Hernandez definitely had a huge impact. After he got his contract pretty much everybody else also wanted a big raise which is why Bayern struggles to offload any undesired players. I don't remember Hernandez ever playing for Bayern! But even if he did, he'd have a mountain to climb, and stay right on top for years, in order to justify his hefty fee. It's definitely him imo. At least you got half of it back from PSG. ""Great"" is a bit much no? Bayern's defence was an absolute circus in Bundesliga last season The memes were legendary though when the ""best team in the world"" at that time got thrashed. He never lived that shit down. [deleted] Similar thing happened with Real Madrid and Bale.  Spurs journos and other respected English journos quoted a price and the RM President came out and said that they were all lying and it was around £30M less than reported. Football leaks a couple years later showed that the price being reported by the English media was actually spot on. (The whole argument was over whether Bale was the world's largest transfer over CR7 etc)  The €95M inc addons price only comes from one person. Uli Hoeness. Who.... Isn't exactly unbiased or trustworthy. Guy will say anything to make himself sound good.  The best Spurs journo corroborated the numbers presented by Sky Sports/BBC Reporters who are usually pretty bang on and said it was £100m+£18M in add-ons. Whether that's true, I mean no one can tell but Ali G is the go-to for Spurs confirmation. He never runs stuff he hasn't heard from multiple sources within the Spurs hierarchy.  Personally, I think it was around the €120M all told, rather than £120M but then, Ali G has never given me cause to disbelieve him. Sure, and a Tottenham journalist who may as well be an official club spokesman said what I said. Both sides have incentives to make it look like a better deal, and like you said, the result is probably a technicality where both sides are sort of telling the truth. E.G. if it's €95M + €20m in almost guaranteed addons (reaching a set number of games played etc.) + some less guaranteed add-ons (CL win etc.) + some non-cash benefits like friendlies and right of refusal on Bayern deadwood that Tottenham would assign a value to, then both sides are technically telling the truth but also not really Hoeneß who famously never bullshits Yeah, no lol. Definitely, that’s why Dier came. Occasionally Bayern had to play with 0 CBs available. Kim played way too much last season while obviously needing a break.  He looked like a shadow of himself IN the asia cup. Seems like he went there already being at his limit and then struggled at the asia cup which I am sure doesnt help in terms of confidence. He only hit 18 I believe. Google Mane 18 for more info. And he seems quite tired and probably slightly injured during the euros. Not a good start for a long second season. Aight, but i forgot Sane he surely goes in starting eleven alongside musiala and kane. Olise and Simons both are quality players but which one will play only Kompany knows everyone, including the bayern board, forgets Tel. Like wtf, develop that kid. great attitude, great potential. Yeah Chelsea and United wanted him as well but he chose Bayern. That was the lack of a DM showing. Our centre backs were being placed under way too much pressure, and they kept having to make very tight, inch-perfect plays that most elite defenders would get wrong. [deleted] Question on football leaks. They seem to have been pretty accurate over the years but have one of their leaks ever been 100% wrong? Like compeltely fabricated Same thing happened for Kolo Muani last season. Frankfurt comes out with 95M, meanwhile the french league did a documentary and show what happens during the last day of the transfer window.   And they receive the contract and state 80 + 5 bonus  quite the difference as well [deleted] Wdym, it's not like he's a convicted criminal. he hit Sané that doesn't work because there's only 9 million in potential bonuses and 18 is of legal age This isn’t r/soccercirclejerk Kompany would probably be fine resting him some days for Tel at least If Kompany insists on starting Sane then Kompany shouldn’t even bother unpacking his stuff. [deleted] The point he is making is when that journalist speaks it is boss/club speaking. Every club has one where the journalist may make the tweet but it’s the club that wrote it. Watching him somehow start twice in a row this Euros now, maybe he was right to do so and we just couldn’t see it. Yes marrying your ""long term"" girlfriend the day she turns 18 is normal. Surely feels like. [deleted] He must have a sextape of someone at the DFB Age of consent in the UK is 16, in Germany it's 14 Lol, I used to work in journalism bud.  But keep on keeping on I guess if you wanna call everything you are ignorant about fairy tales. I can’t help you then."
"[Transfermarkt] Players Man Utd signed under Ten Hag","2024-10-30T16:57:08+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gfrdb5/transfermarkt_players_man_utd_signed_under_ten_hag/","[No textual content]","317","fetissimies","https://i.redd.it/690i397acxxd1.jpeg","**The OP has marked this post as Original Content (OC).

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* That top 5, though. More than half of what they spend.   Antony just made everyone at the club look bad.  Hojlund and Yoro still just raw talents and we haven't even seen the latter yet.  Casemiro was great for a season but very poor long term planning. Also makes no sense getting him after failing to get Frenkie.  Then there's Mount and we still don't know why they got him.   At least Casemiro was amazing that first season, but overall... You wonder if they could use this budget a bit more effectively... >Screenshot the page of transfermarkt   ""OC"" lmao The more I think about it the more ridiculous Antony was as a signing. Like even if he would've done a decent job, that is such a ridiculous amount of money. You could get some of the best and most proven wingers in the world for that. I really don't get United decisions. They clearly had no confidence with Ten Haag and were searching for replacements before FA cup. Then he wins it and suddenly all's well enough to give him extension and chequebook to spend more Jonny Evans may actually be his best signing for what weve been able to get out of him. The problem with Manchester United is not the front office or managers, the problem is the desperation to be good immediately. They need to have a longer term plan. I just don’t think fans will accept that, and instead of allowing young players time to develop the media and fanbase is toxic that managers have no patience and young players lose confidence. That Dubravka loan was so random [deleted] i know antony basically become a meme but dear lord that mount transfer is awful. 95M  He must be a top player in the world now😭😭🏆🏆 It will be funny if they play well with Amorim  The two free transfers were his best ones I remember being downvoted for saying EtH is a typical Dutch manager mainly buying players from NL and got downvoted like crazy, yet 10 players of this list have a past in NL. If any other club had signed these players they'd be one of the best. The players have underperformed but there's got to be something deeper in the club causing so many solid-great players (and managers) to suddenly play like shit. That money that was paid for Mason Mount is absolutely hilarious. One year left on his deal at Chelsea and then he ends up injured for the majority of his year that United signed him anyway. Tbf, the only real disaster signings were Antony & Mount. Bar Casemiro, the rest are relatively young and could stay with the squad long term and improve under a new manager.   The Casemiro signing is a weird one, we haven't sorted out our midfield since Carrick left. That has to be the priority for Amorim, Ugarte looked great under him so hopefully that's a huge step in the right direction. In hindsight it’s incredible how many signings were poor and overpaid Wow, top 5 has like 2 players that were worth getting for the price.  Antony should have been a jailable offence, Case was a case of another club fleecing united since they are desperate for stars, Likewise with Mason.   I think there are a couple of rules united could do well adhere to for transfers:  1. If a player is on a downward trajectory- Chances are that the added pressure of united won't magically make him change course and become a better player  2. If a player out there is extremely hyped but there's zero interest from Real, Barca or Bayern - Then chances are he is not good enough. We can argue if they should have gone for different targets but this list mostly underscores their terrible negotiators. They massively overpaid pretty much for every single player and gave them ridiculous salaries on top. If only they got him that Frank lad , he would've conquered the world This level of failure in recruitment should be studied Fucking hell I legitimately keep forgetting Mason Mount is there I mean, apart from Onana there is no undisputed starter there, right ? They have made terrible decisions over the years its insane Ajax's double agent Genuinely astounding how poor their scouting really is. Their defensive line would be pretty stacked if any of them could manage to stay fit for more than five minutes. Not gonna get into the obvious one but 273 million on Zirkee, Hojlund, Onana, Ugarte and Martinez is really something to behold. Dreadful business Cost aside maybe 2.5 good players signed? Which ones do you guys think were actually good signings? Onana has been decent right? Jesus christ, this is some Bartomeu level deals Crazy that Malachia was his first signing and is still there. I genuinely can't remember a game with him He also sold this guy for £25m… not great business either  https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2e772xvx37o.amp 9M to loan Amrabat LOL What a waste of money, none of these player are world class or close to it. casemiro edging 30 when he signed. Antony, Casemiro, and Mount.  3 absolutely shocking transfers. Remains to be seen how a decent part of them end up. 3/5 of that top 5 is dire tho. Atleast Case has some goals and played matches Jack fucking Butland?! Over 600 million euros spent in the 2.5 year period…. After spending loads for years already. Manager fully backed, 300 of that mil on  Ajax players… truly one of the most shameless things we will ever see.   But it doesn’t matter. United revenues so high they can just piss money away for the next 2 decades with no repercussions. He's gone lads. This sub is milking everything possible about ten Hag. Weird weird obsession. Top 6 are all poor signings but even than Antony stands out by far De ligt is the only great player he signed.... De ligt is like the old school United player, player who plays for the badge, similar to someone like Roy Keane You get to 300 mil spent in the first 4 players….. I mean holy fuck Mount PR machine was on overdrive for years. Him being young and English made everyone overlook the underlying stats and areas of struggle. Buying Hojlund for 70+ million wasn't a good decision. >Antony just made everyone at the club look bad  We blaming the goat for being too good now? Mount was as seen as the perfect ETH player who can press like crazy but versatile. Got Mount and sold McT... why? Hojlund got sold as if he was the real deal, much like Martial.  Man u loves getting fleeced. I broadly know high-profile players, at least by name. Genuinely, who the fuck is Yoro?   I saw him on the list, saw the transfer fee and was like ?????! What do you mean, it's Original Creenshot! Timeline:  * Internal scouting reports told them not to go higher than £25m  * Quoted £40m by Ajax  * Retreated  * United failed to find a better player  * Went back in for him weeks later and price went up to £86m  * Congratulations on your order, you have now earned a 5% discount on your next purchase from the Ajax superstore [deleted] You can get one kvaravichelia with that money They could've bought Kane with that money, lmao. (Though I doubt he'd actually have transferred to them, tbf) how we felt about Pepe  that transfer turned out to be actual fraud done by Raul Sanllehi, what the fuck was ten hag's excuse  Edit: I was focusing on the second sentence of what I replied to. I thought he was alright, much better than Anthony, but at most a £35m player Liverpool did the same thing with Rodgers. They were ready to fire him, decided not to and then went on the sign Benteke only to fire Rodgers 3 months later. I do think that the transfers this summer were more 'club' transfers than the previous summers. And Ugarte really felt like a player ten Hag didn't even want, which could be the case given he's previously worked under Amorim. I don't really have any worries about de Ligt, mazra, Ugarte or yoro working with his system, Zirkzee the jury is still out on. The extension was more of a technicality, automatic trigger. Its not like the situation a few years ago with Jose. Also fans have to realize this isn't FIFA or FM Manager. Ten Hag had veto power and influence, perhaps too much influence but these decisions involved other people as well. Do we really think Ten Hag said get me Antony at 80m! Or After missing on on FDJ, pushing for an older Casemiro who is almost the complete opposite in profile? Exactly, win now = suck forever No the problem was definitely the board and scouting before this summer too. Yeah but then you look at those signings and think wtf is that He got a league cup medal for it as well, not bad for two games work. Erik Ten Haggle Truly a disgrace he wasn't nominated for the ballon d'or Antony and Mount would flop at any top club, they are average players Can't cope with the pressure playing with the biggest club in the country [deleted] Not scouting, decision making. #5 hasn't even made his debut☠️ [deleted] Martinez I actually think Mount has played good for United, the main two problems are that he is injured ALL THE TIME, and Utd spent 50-60m on a player with 1 year left on his contract No way you would say this if he was still at Chelsea. tbf Mount did have a 11G+10A season it just happened to be mostly from set pieces. He was great for us for 2 years straight and played absurd amounts without a rest until he started getting injuries. He'd be good for United if he wasn't injured all the time  The fact that he left sucks, but let's not rewrite history Mount was living off his 2021 performances especially in the UCL where he was genuinely one of the top 15-20 players itw. Reminds me of our Torres signing - player who used to be in form, gets signed by rival club as form starts to dip and then he completely flops. If he's who you point to in that list…. He has immense potential, but he just doesn't get enough service   He has 3 shots till now in total, and 1 of them is a goal Hojlund already statistically an elite finisher and the rest of what he needs can be taught. Finishing generally is tough to develop (like Timo Werner ....).  If he went to City he'd get 25-30 goals a year and no one would say anything.  He's the last guy I worry about in that list.  For me the mistakes were Mount and Antony. Mount = Bruno honestly looks awful 90% of the time. And Antony... no need to explain at this point. Maybe the fee is high, but he does definitely have talent. He’s still raw and needs nurturing, as well as getting better service, but if he’d gone into a more settled side no one would have concerns about the fee. That's on you tbh I read that as cream shot at first, god help me😭😭 I wish i could be a fly in the room of the Ajax board when they heard United was willing to pay the fuck off price. Also from São Paulo store, Antony and Casemiro's deals gave us a needed bump in our budget. It was ETH who insisted on him. Didn’t think United rated him.  Murtough was so sluggish on every decision. Whitwell wrote an article about all the young stars that were found by United, only to go somewhere else bc Murtough and his staff would drag their feet on signing them. Even some kids who really wanted to join and were waiting and waiting for months eventually gave up and signed elsewhere. And on multiple occasions he did something like Antony where there was no real plan and he panic bought players towrds the end of the window and over paid for them.   Such a moronic way to run the club and people keep bringing up the recent past as if United will be ran like that moving forward with the likes of Berrada and Ashworth at the helm. I'm honestly surprised United didn't get lower than 6th or 7th before ETH got there. Think we lost interest around the 40-50mil mark Cute how you seem to think Antony would ever have been available for under 40 million. Decent try Pepe was a good player, just didn’t suit Arteta’s system. He had more goal contributions for Arsenal than Antony and Sancho put together for Man Utd. Pepe also wasn't on as high of wages. He wasn't cheap, but he wasn't \~£200k/week (I think he was more in the 140k/week range). Always felt bad for Pepe. If it hadn't been for that messed up transfer fee, I think most would look back on him as a decent player who just didn't quite work out. Didn’t Chelsea do the same with Tuchel and Aubemeyang? How he survived that 6-1 loss at Stoke is beyond me. I read the book How to Win the Premier League a little while back, which documents his and Klopp’s time at the club. Apparently he was told on several occasions Benteke wasn’t the player the club should sign but completely ignored the data analysis on what they recommended. The club tried to guide him but he always thought he knew better. And now with another manager, they'll redo the cycle all over again Antony I believe it was more of a ""if you want me to succeed get him at any cost"", casemiro yeah more like PR/commercial move to sell shirts since they didn't get the main target I always assumed the Ronaldo deal was boardroom driven, instead of managerial. Such a big piece of business to do under an interim manager. 4 of the 10 most expensive players on this list were signed this summer. Ok fair enough that one has been injured, but it doesn’t seem to me like the scouting and the decision making improved dramatically. Really which signing? I mean Antony has turned out horribly, but at the time he was highly coveted based on his performances with Ajax. buy high, sell low. 90m was way too much for Antony but he was decent for Ajax. Way better than he's been for you lot anyway And Anthony Martial was Joel Glazer’s favourite player and was quoted comparing him to Pele. Ambitious managers are lured to United by the legacy SAF built just to find out there are a bunch of silly monkeys on the floor above. Just to contradict slightly, we never refused to signed Caicedo, there’s actually a really weird sorry about that.  Basically Caicedo had 3 different agents all claiming to be his representation and all trying to secure deals for him, nobody knew what was going on and it wasn’t until Brighton used a contact at the club they knew to find out was they able to get him.  Essentially United and all the other clubs were talking to agents that were just trying to scam them. I know. Just wanted to include Martinez.  I mean yeah depends on your ambition I guess. If United wants to get back to where they once were these players aren't gonna help. Martinez certainly isn't ""brilliant"" lol.  Yoro obviously excluded and Casemiro wasn't a bad signing but turned out to be bad. The others are either just mediocre or simply bad signings. Onana as well. They aren't wordclass and will not help United back to title winning seasons. Yeah they look monumentally better while pressing with him, it's just we've barely seen him I said this while he was at Chelsea, never thought he was our best player, always thought he was overrated because of being an English academy kid. His goals came in buckets against mostly lower table teams, his assists came from set pieces, very little open play creativity, poor performances against bigger clubs. He was not great, he was very good in a system that allowed him a lot of freedom and to generate high volume stats that immediately fell off when he didn't have five world class players and a world class coach to make him look better than he was. Jorgi, Kante, Silva, Rudi, and RJ were clearly better in some combination the CL year, the year after RJ was hurt and Kovacic had to carry more of the midfield and was still better than Mount. The season Tuchel left Mount nosedived. Others are known as bad transfers. People hardly talk about Hojlund. He has potential, but you should never pay more than like 45 mil on just potential (unless it's like Yamal or Endrick type potential) I imagine it somewhat like that Wolf of Wall Street phone sales scene: https://youtu.be/c1Vtzn3MZyA?si=rWqJa_Gv7HBHxVpY how are finances at SPFC these days? Ultimately spent enough to not finish too low. Money poorly spent still provided some value. It's just with a proper plan and the level of spend, United could have one of the top four squads in the world. Instead they might not even have one of the top four in the EPL. I mean they spend like 300mln on players that often don't even play and when they do they are not good enough.     For 300mln I'm 100% sure they could get both Kvara and Osi, then just get some new CDM next to Mainoo who is already balling and your team is more or less good.     Then they have like 300mln spend on defenders that they still have in their team, for that money you could get really elite pair of defenders that are ready every week. I think that was relatively cheap though. Benteke was our second largest transfer at the time. Also, the fact that we managed to sell him for no loss to Crystal Palace is a shock. I mean god I hope not. This is the next test for the new footballing structure. For sure though if they are going to play 343 they certainly need reinforcements at CB and wing back in addition to all their forward problems. Sigh.... This is not true. FFS.   If you look at the team Ten Hag inherited the only right winger we really had was Elanga. United looked at Antony early that summer. Ajax said something like 60m and United said no thanks. Fast forward those two losses, its late August so they enquire again because Antony and his agent were pushing for the move. 60m because 80 or whatever because  of United's poor hand in negotiations. Edwin Van der Sar even said we wanted to get the highest amount possible. I don't blame Ten Hag, I actually blame United hierarchy for not having a suitable alternative.  Same thing with Casemiro. We wanted FDJ, Ten Hag wanted to build his team around him. When that didn't happen, again there was no alternative, United went back to the old way of talking to agents, that's how you get United literally taking out a revolving credit line to sign both players late in the window. Couldn't they get Antony for cheaper if they had tried in June instead of August? Ole wasn’t interim at that point tho.  Ole obviously wanted a striker than summer but the club didn’t seem to be bothered. And then near the end, Ronaldo obviously became available and club moved for him, kind of ticking the striker box, bringing in a big name the fans adored and would sell stuff.  But it kind of made some sense on paper, given our lack of goal scorer up front. That's not true. Antony was a good player for the Eredivisie but not even close to being the biggest talent in that Ajax squad. Just check out his stats. They're good for a starting 11 player for Ajax but nothing special fly high, crash deep [deleted] Well you might be the only one. Constantly heard Chelsea fans claiming he was better than Foden. For a player whose number 1 asset is his ability to lead the press, also returning 21 G+A makes him incredibly handy. But... he'll never be that player again due to a combination of injuries and moving to United. We didn't have a single world class forward when he was doing well and he was our main source of creativity and had a goal in him too, but your genius take is that players like Kante, Rudiger, Silva, etc. (only players who'd even be considered to be world class) were making him look much better than he was?  He fell off when he was injured, he's still shown glimpses of his old self at United but can't stay fit  Mount is shit but all I see is praise for players like Sancho, Neto, Madueke, etc. now, who are all worse than Mount was for us both statistically and with the eye test lol I mean he's 21 in his 2nd season, I’d say it's fair to give him more time. No striker would be successful in the car crash of a system Ten Hag had. Textbook United tax in his case tbf, cheaper price was quoted earlier in the summer then Atalanta kept putting the price up because it was United Bad, we're kinda stuck being a club that didn't focus on paying our bills for a better future like Flamengo and Palmeiras but we also don't have someone with a lot of money to invest in us like Botafogo and Atlético-MG, so we're able to compete but have to sell our best players every season. I was talking about his spelling of Kvaratskhelia haha Mate it's utd they don't usually do smart They though 60m was too high, weren't going to pursue, than panicked after those poor results in August. I think it was feasible for a fee in the 60s, but they wanted Martinez and Ajax weren’t prepared to lose another key player, so we had to pay a massive premium to get Antony. Ahh, you're right, I had it in my head that it happened in the period between Ole and Ten Hag, but it happened right near the end of Ole's time. He was a rising young Brazilian talent who excelled in the Champions League and was an established starter on a very good Ajax team. I agree his price was inflated, but it was still seen as a good addition at the time. How so? What's so ridiculous about my take. None of those players would make minutes at City or Liverpool. Now I get United wasn't in a position to get the best of the best. But they could certainly have done better than this lot.  And I'm not saying all there signing are bad. De Ligt I thought was a good signing for example although his current form is not backing that up. So was Casemiro. Mazraoui is a decent signing as well. Mount had such a weird rep with our fans, felt like half the fanbase loved him, and the other half acted like he pissed in their cereal every morning. And now he's gone the half who hated him laugh at his injuries and act like he isn't an academy grown lad. There was a a pretty even split I'd say. The ones that thought he was the greatest player of all time were very loud but you can go back and see many people slating him even in his best season because honestly he was incredibly overrated. Never thought he should have been POTS twice, especially over any of our other midfielders at the time. One of the most upvoted Chelsea votes I remember seeing was Foden holding a fish Mount holding the CL trophy. Foden would then go onto win the CL. Mount may have been better for a couple of seasons though. But he wasn't creative or a reliable goal scorer. We were winning because of our insanely tight control of games. He had more freedom than any of the other forwards and I don't particularly rate his positional discipline or ability to play as a real midfielder. Also, you're naming wingers which was ironically the worst position for Mount to pretend to play. 70m for a player who still hasn't really come good after two seasons and still unsure if he would fulfil his potential that's sad to hear [deleted] Lmao, just take a look at his fbref pages in 20/21 and 21/22, in 20/21 he was still a bit raw of course but shot creating actions, progressive passes/carries are all quite good. In 21/22 his numbers are similar to the likes of Bruno, Saka, and even better in some areas. Baffling take considering his creativity and ability to press/work hard are by far his 2 best traits.  Never said he was a ""reliable goal scorer"", I said he had a goal in him. His goal scoring tally in his best season (21/22) with us were higher than Bruno and just 1 below Foden.  > We were winning because of our insanely tight control of games  Interesting that you completely dropped the whole ""the world class players around him were making him look good"" because you realized how clueless you sound. If you think Mount didn't contribute to of our wins and that ""insane control"" then you're genuinely watching a whole different sport.  > Also, you're naming wingers which was ironically the worst position for Mount to pretend to play  Yet he still had better numbers, stats, and pressed more than all of them combined? Mount often drifted to either wing depending on the game/situation under Tuchel too, combined with Reece and Chilwell often. He's better than every single winger/10 profile (hell, even forwards in general) we've had during or after his time barring Palmer and Jackson He's only played 1 season, this is the very beginning of his second, he's 21 and we knew we were getting a young raw forward. Ignore the downvotes. Regardless of his age and the fact that he's only had 1 season in the PL, I just don't see a 70m player there. A club like Man Utd can't afford to have a striker who will score once every 5+ games and whom frankly isn't a threat most games.   Don't forget that we're the same team that's waiting for a 27yo player (Rashford) to become consistent...   Same club that held on to Martial and Lingard for way too long for similar reasons.     I seriously see Hojlind and Zirkzee taking the same route due to the outlay on them.  That manager will do a decent job the first season and squeeze into top 4. and then struggle the following 2 seasons and then get sacked. Rinse. Repeat. This is United now. Mount Stans are a different breed, let me make it easier for you, our world class players were all defenders and midfielders giving us a tremendous control of games which is why we won. I know that might be hard to grasp because you probably only know about G+A. Mount being deployed as a winger in those games was football malpractice and I'm glad we have actual wingers now, although Noni plays a lot like him, head down, poor vision, tons of bad shots in the wrong moments. It's 70m and he hasn't even done anything remarkable. Because he's only had 1 full season under terrible management"

""What if we never do that again ... but instead just normalize 80m€ transfers!"" I forgot City unveiled Grealish the day when Barca released Messi >I feel that this record won't be broken for some time, since this is more of a powerplay by a team funded by an entire country for arguably the 3rd best player in the world. I expect at least 5 years for the record to be broken tbh.  However, I feel this transfer made the 100m mark, which was quite obscene to go above, a bit normalised and we may see more transfers in the 100-150m region in the coming time.   This guy just gets it For Ronaldo transfer to Madrid, the comments are at 0.024k and the upvotes at around 0.033k (it fluctuates with each refresh).  Or simpler, 24 and ~33. **Players Who Appear Multiple Times**  * Neymar (x3) * Romelu Lukaku (x3) * Cristiano Ronaldo (x2) * Kai Havertz (x2)  **Clubs that Appear the Most**  * Real Madrid (x7) * Manchester United (x7) * Barcelona (x6) * Chelsea (x6) * Juventus (x5) * Manchester City (x4)  Some other humorous things I found...  * r/Soccer was barely alive back in 2009. Hence why the link is from r/sports. I enjoyed some of the comments from back then.  > He seems like the sort of player that needs discipline and in terms of that, there is no one better than Alex Ferguson. Which is why I don't think this would be a great move for him, I could be wrong.   * Having meditated on the list, while there are many poor transfers here, I think it's safe to say Hazard is the worst transfer of All-Time.  * I had honestly forgotten about the immense skepticism over the likelihood of the Bale signing working out. In large part due to the fact he was Welsh lol [This seems so insane in hindsight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6wf42d/breaking_psg_agree_deal_to_sign_kylian_mbappe/dm7yjw1/) ""From underwhelming links to Carrasco, Brahimi, and the likes to getting linked to Zaha and then fucking signing Pepe for 80m, that's some big dick turn around."" LMAOOOO One of the best posts on this sub, so much nostalgia. Seeing what people said back then and how it ended up is amazing. >50  most expensive transfers in football history  gives 80   clickbait title Wild that Hazard is the most expensive transfer that people thought was not an overpay, and he turned out to be one of the worst transfers in history That N'Dombele thread is so fucking depressing, you can only laugh Someone said ‘I have a feeling the Bale transfer will go down as the worst of all time.’  Talk about being horrendously wrong. 2 years away from that 600 million transfer Zinedine Zidane going for 75 million in 2001 is absolutely insane. Imagine what he would cost today On the sancho post:  > [–]TheRedWizard17  > 80 points 3 years ago   > WOOOOOOOO > now cue the “he’s overrated” comments  oh mate he's the one who jinxed it # 42 | €77.50M | Jul. 9 2001 | Zinédine Zidane | Real Madrid | N/A | N/A | N/A     The Zidane transfer fee is still the most craziest when you think about it and put it in perspective.  For context, based on [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/real-madrid-achieved-highest-revenue-history-843-million-amir-somoggi/) link, Real Madrid's revenue that year was only 138 million Euros! Wild.   Picked up this comment under Mbappe’s transfer   “I think Dembelè and Asensio are better than him, at least when it comes to technique. Mbappè is great at goalscoring but that’s the most inconsistent thing possible, if he stops scoring he will be a massive flop” I completely forgot Ronaldo was at Juve. Zidane being here is crazy. Out of 7 Madrid buys, 5 were a total success, James a good one, and Hazard was.... Haxard Really can't believe Antony is the 19th most expensive transfer  In hindsight it seems completely nuts That Lukaku - Chelsea thread is so optimistic. Fuck. Brilliant post OP.  Well done. I have previously upvoted an embarrassing amount of these   I need to spend less time on this godforsaken site lol Did we ever get that tattooed nutsack? Just wanted to add a comment so this gets more visibility in the algorithm, really fun stuff OP. Also nice to know some /r/soccer jokes haven't changed in a decade, some threads have as the top comment ""Wow this was out of nowhere"" for transfers that were widely reported. People saying that Zlatan was very overrated is so funny. I know he probably peaked pretty late in his career but in hindsight he had one of the most fun careers of all time, playing in 4/5 of the top 5 leagues. He’s easily a top 5 striker that we have seen for the last 15 years and one of the most iconic one of all time. Such a legend. If we adjust for impact and inflation - Figo move won't be #87.  It should be in top 3 considering it happened in 2000 for 60 million. Also it was very controversial from Barca to Madrid.  It started Perez era we are seeing today. not gonna lie, to this day when I see a big transfer I can't help but see in units of Torres's = 50m pounds Fucking Coutinho hahahaha guy’s back at Vasco nowadays Fascinating to see posts from 2008 like Ronaldo and Kaka to Madrid. Cool to see what Reddit was like back then the Coutinho one still gets me. > Ben white is only 4 years younger than varane who is a world class CB compared to White who is an average pl defender and even then varane’s prospective fee (50 million euros) would be 8 million less than white to arsenal > > Even considering the one year left on the deal in comparison Man Utd are getting much more bang for their buck.  Well…. Still makes me giggle that PSG threw 400 million to sign 2 players, added Messi to that later on and STILL couldn't win the UCL. Couldn't even win the league every year. Seeing all the comments about the Osimhen signing really makes me smile.  The striker that won us the title and a lot of people were happy but, justly, some people thought that we were overpaying him (again, fair enough).  It just makes me smile now.   Also one guy said that he'd be better than Cavani.  In a way, he was right Would be nice as well to put the clubs theh transferred from The whole ndombele to spurs thread aged like rotten milk. Where’s my man Nicolas Pepe? That Ibra thread lol. How many people promised to tattoo their balls in these kinds of threads? Great post Rating as a hit or miss, Darwin’s rating is post That £116m spent on Enzo Fernandez is going down the drain lol.  Obligatory fuck PSG for spending nearly £360 million on two players alone, but I guess there is still justice in this world that they have yet to won the UCL and these two players have now all left. Neymar to Al Hilal cost 90 million?? Looking at the Isak one is quality.  >>Brother you just scammed Newcastle.  >>That's a hell of a lot of money for Isak  >>He's a good player but he's not 70m good.  >>bro that’s wayyy too much lmao  >>I remember when we looked at him, it looked like he had everything in his locker apart from finishing.  (Arsenal fan)  >>I don't know man, I think he's terribly overrated here on reddit. Most of the time he's just an average striker.  >>He’s not worth that, even in this inflated market.   >>He's been wank for a while and isn't even a goalscorer.  >>70M for Isak is just crazy. Real Sociedad hit a jackpot here.  Now for the accurate predictions:  >>Isak is worth more. Everyone will say Newcastle got rinsed but the kid has talent and will be one of the best strikers in the world one day.  Thats pretty much it, majority of the comments are shitting on him.  Turns out the people who said he wasn't worth 70m were strangely right - he's worth at least 120m. Regarding the RKM saga a year ago: yes, I still think he’s a dick, but while things were a little rough for a while, Marmoush filled in for him really well. It’s also amazing to see how every PSG fan hated Ekitiké for not wanting to join Eintracht that summer. PSG went on to absolutely demolish the guy by treating him like garbage and not even offering him any sort of professional training. Half a year later, Ekitiké did join Eintracht, on loan with a significantly lower option to buy than what PSG wanted for him in the summer. Ekitiké’s fitness was atrocious. He was fit as in “he kept himself fit”, but nowhere near professional level fit. It took us three months to get him back to professional fitness levels, but since he arrived there, he has been a fantastic addition to the squad.   Fuck PSG with a rusty nail board, but cheers for the 95 million and Ekitiké I guess. You can buy him back for another 100 million in a year. In my opinion I genuinely believe the only worthy transfer was Ronaldo to Real Madrid.  He not only done it for himself but the club, especially the hattrick of CL, not to mention his insane goal record on top.  No other player with a high price even did half, £80m back then was insane, I still remember waking up in 2009 reading ""Man Utd accept £80m Ronaldo bid"" this was the article i saw http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8094720.stm  Even though I was gutted he left the price felt fair, then years later I see the same price spent on a fidget spinner.  The Neymar and Mbappe ones were more of a shock as it felt weird, it didn't sit right.  Edit: can't even share my personal opinion without downvotes, its even more bizarre as a player I liked Messi more, I just couldn't admit it as I was young back in 2009, but im sane and level headed to understand players.  Today? People take everything personal which is quite sad, appreciate both because its the end and well never see two going at it in our lifetime. [deleted] On Mbappe's transfer:  >or 0.81 Neymar   >>actually insane to think about when Mbappe has only played 1 season   >All these clubs chasing him have been doing so since he was in his early teens. We bid £40m last summer when he'd only scored one senior goal.   >Last season was just confirmation of what they already thought. The kid is a once in a generation talent.  >>How is he ""once in a generation"" when he is (arguably) just marginally better than Dembele and Asensio? Any of the three could end up being better than the other 2, they can hardly be ranked amongst each other   >I think Dembelè and Asensio are better than him, at least when it comes to technique. Mbappè is great at goalscoring but that's the most inconsistent thing possible, if he stops scoring he will be a massive flop Oh my god...r/soccer court....so cringe And then some Americans appear at Chelsea and said how bout we start doing crazy shit again I think that’s the natural reaction to so many €100m transfer being busts or…not complete successes.  Clubs are hesitant to spend that much, and it puts a lot of pressure on 1 person. Can you imagine the time line where Messi went to City and got the #10   I wonder what all would Be different… Quite accurate. However, 100-150M transfers haven't been as frequent since that transfer as we all feared at that time. Lots of transfers within the 90-110M range for sure though but that isn't as ridiculous a jump from the 70-80M mark that used to be there with the likes of Higuain Pogba and Bale prior to Neymar. Funny how the top comment on that thread is like ""I don't know if this is the right move for him"". I chuckled. I still got my news from the newspapers back then lol. Pretty sure I still have some of the cutouts back at my parents house.  I remember watching the news breaking in my college cafeteria TV. He was injured to iirc and all the pictures were of him in crutches.   And Madrid had just unveiled freaking Kaka earlier too. I'm reading Ronaldo to Juventus and people are so hyped    >[–]aNigerianPrince 132 points 6 years ago   >Juventus 2019 CL winners confirmed     Funny people now say Juventus were a poor team and Ronaldo made a mistake joining them Even back in 2013 when I joined, this place was tiny. The number of daily posters was so small you kind of knew everyone and ended up discussing things with the same few dozen people.   It was definitely miles better for serious football discussion, but now the community is so big I love that we have people from basically every country who can give their differing viewpoints, especially on topics where sport and culture/politics butt up against each other. Stories like the Argentina/France chant you can go in the threads and find French people and Argentines explaining how it’s being viewed in their countries or giving more background detail,  And the highlights and how quickly they’re posted is insane. It was a big talking point that bale was a homebody. Would go back home to wales any chance he got while at spurs so it was a genuine concern he wouldn’t settle in Spain We are also with 4 appearances: Nunez, Van Dijk, Szobo and Alisson. Di Maria is on there twice as well > I'd honestly put Mbappe clearly above Dembele, whom I'd put clearly ahead of anyone else. Similarly to how Ronaldo and Pulisic are clearly above everyone else right now, only that Mbappe and Dembele wouldn't be as far ahead.  i need to speak to the guy who said this [Nvm this is even funnier ](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6vz2qt/comment/dm41acf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) An entire comment chain talking bs. That comment made me actually chuckle when I read it, I wasn't here at the time, but I remember watching Mbape for Monaco the previous year in the Champions League, and looking back to see someone say he is arguably worse than Dembele is mental to think about, nevermind the number of updoots and replies saying similar if not more baffling things. Now that the site has been around and popular for over a decade I love looking to see if I can find the reddit thread whenever someone posts an ""X years ago Y player did this."" I just wish reddit didn't delete comments when users deleted their accounts, a lot of those threads are just [deleted]: Deleted It’s due to inflation The optimism from Spurs fans is... haunting. It went horrendously wrong for anyone that played them in the CL McGawf incoming Even just off inflation alone we're probably looking somewhere around the 130 mils. The man would be top 5 transfers for sure, very very likely top 3 Figo cost 1/3rd of Madrid’s yearly revenue which today would be almost €300 million The 2017 transfer?? Crazy how they all 3 ended up at PSG together last season I think they got the technique part right at least One of his more underrated periods honestly, Covid fucked so much with time, this jump and header is absolutely insane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AunImole9HI  Literally floats in the air, fucking hell that Juventus should've done more but Ajax 2019 sneaked up to their asses like with Madrid The GOAT Fred made the list. My King Zlatan biggest failure is never winning a champions league He's #39 i think Bale was also worth it, he was a clutch player in the CL triple. Out of the whole list?  Its hard to judge anyone against Ronaldo tbf, regardless of amount spent. But like just chosing one, Van Dijk to Liverpool Has Been insanely succesfull, if it wasnt for utter City domination they wouldbeasily won more titles adding to what they actually won Barcelona completely squandered the money after, but Neymar for 88m(even with the shady dealings) was 100% worth it. With him in the squad we won a treble, a domestic double, and then a CDR. After that we more than doubled our money with the 220m euros for him. Hard to say that wasn't worth it, even though the future transfers fucked us up. Bale ChatGPT ass comment You're welcome for our foolishness [deleted] To be fair if COVID hadn't happened we would have seen a lot more transfers in that range. Just look at how high some transfers are right now even after having even bankruptcy dangers off COVID. Micah Richards level of foresight. I originally joined around 2014ish iirc and miss those days tbh, feel like all of the regular posters from back then have slowly disappeared, but it felt like much more of a community then. Early 2010s /r/soccer was a lot of fun OP is talking about in the top50 i presume rather than the top 80 which he listed, seeing how he also left out de Ligt (and probably some others) who is also twice on the list Lmao I'm sure Pulisic was just a meme, I don't think he's ever been close to being regarded as top 10 in the world The funniest thing looking back on threads from years ago is how often most people are wrong on here, you’ll find people who are right all the time but the majority of people just has no idea wtf they are talking about (me included) The other fans saying how great of a signing it was is also jarring Yes Found an inflation calculator. It says he would cost 175 million euros in today’s market. Jesus Christ. Ten Hag masterclass, no wonder Ronaldo hated him It's very annoying though. Pretty sure City didnt Play Stoke sińce Grealish joined so the question would still stand well the fact that Stoke don’t play PL ball doesn’t help ofcourse he would have  league stage messi is unstoppable, he played motm level in a swimming pool instead of pitches in LL Tbh, that kinda goes for the whole internet, it feels like. Some of the poster  was swallowed up by big medias as writers iirc I will fully admit I am wrong 97% of the time. What does Ten Hag have to with this? This is why I make random history references. To keep the relative insanity in the internet at high levels Come on man He was the manager of Ajax in their win against Juventus that the other comment mentioned."

He was more expensive than Maguire lol Martinez from Atalanta lmao Martinez from Atalanta  Gvardiol doesn't exist does he? Lucas Hernandez? Technically, Gvardiol was a CB when City splurged €90m on him. Martinez from Atalanta?? And wasn’t Gvardiol 90m If De Ligt still goes to United for £50m he would be in here three times lol. As a Bayern fan I’m actually 100% certain we‘re missing Lucas Hernandez here 8 out of 10 are purchased by English clubs and the other 2 is De Ligt hahaha Who is this Fofana guy? Never seen him How many games did Fofana play? Van Dijk, Dias, Laporte, Stones and probably Romero has been worth it I remember thinking we overpaid for VVD, especially after the summer fiasco prior, oh boy was I wrong. Stupid list. [deleted] Im assuming this may not be counting Ben White as a centre back? Yesterday's news tomorrow Prem inflation and man utd keeps overpaying Two sales in the top 4, not bad. Thanks Chelsea! Jesus. I had no idea Fofana cost us 80 😭 Thank God it's not my money. That's a devastating failure. Barring Van Dijk, none of the others have smashed it in a way that they're club legends.  And that's the reality of throwing money to solve problems. It doesn't work more often than not. ‘HARRY MAGUIRE Maguire 💀💀💀 Come on lads let's put de Ligt on there a third time ASHWORTH ABSURDITY WOOOOOOOO Yeah but if you put Maguire top of the list you drive more engagement from people who can laugh about how bad United are (were🤞)at transfers.  Never ignored, and all that. Might be considering him a lb Gvardiol was cheaper in pounds but the conversion rates were obviously different at the time It’s probably a mistake on purpose to generate engagement. Ajalanta Think they probably class him as a full back for this purpose which is dumb. If they put everyone on the list then Yoro isn't on it and they have nothing to post! Have to tweak it a little. They classify him as a left back now, but they really should take into account what position he played at the time he was bought. Who is the martinez from atalanta?   Had a little look but can't be bothered Once you show insane potential before the age of 20, it takes a lot of time for clubs to give up on you. It's highly likely that Havertz gets sold in a season or two and even he could end up on a similar list for forwards/AMs Anelka of CBs And each time would be, based on the numbers spoken about, a drop in fee He played left back more than 5 times so Transfermarkt decided he's no longer a CB. 21 games across two years. He’s on £200k per week btw with 5 more years remaining on his contract. De Ligt and Martinez as well. How is martinez not on the list. Wc winner, Copa America, fa cup and carabao cup. Maybe if we played for another club, he would get more recognition The more bizarre thing is that neither Atalanta or Juventus wanted to keep him that much Stones is definitely going to end up being a club legend. I'm not too aware of City pre-Robinho, but I'd say he's probably the next best City centre back after Kompany. He's not even in the list. Nonsense, Gvardiol’s transfer was more expensive even in pounds, £77.6m while maguire was exactly £74m. Man city had to pay 90m€ but since they are using pounds they paid £77.6m. No conversion rates are needed for this, gvardiol is officially more expensive in both currencies. Numbers won’t change since Man City already paid said amount. I dont think transfermarkt really have a need to do that Could've just made 18 year old and younger defenders. We might play Yoro as a DM in 3 years so get him off the list! Ben White should be on this list too then right? > they really should take into account what position he played at the time he was bought.  That doesnt make any sense, they should count what position the buyer wanted him to play in. And doesnt necessarily have to coincide with the position he was playing at the seller's team.  Bellingham is another example. Should he be counted as defensive midfielder? It's wrong  Lisandro Martinez came from Ajax They most likely confused Lucas Martinez Quarta with Lisandro Martinez not sure arsenal would sell havertz so suddenly, arteta loves him tbf, de Ligt is still a great CB and atleast a good rotational option for any big club out there. But yeah, people expected more of him by now Holy jesus ... With appearances like that, you'd think he was injured... Jury still out given he’s played 50% of league games in his two seasons due to injury.   No matter how good you are, you’re useless if you can’t make it on to the pitch half the time.  If that continues then he will categorically not be a good signing. This is a bit incorrect. That was a club record sale for Atalanta, they couldn’t say no to that when Romero wanted to leave.   Juve meanwhile didn’t really give him a chance, and keeping him after his defender of the year season was completely out of their hands at that point as Atalanta has the purchase option. I can think of 10-15 players that were more significant to City's success in the Pep era itself. Dias is technically better too.  Lad has averaged 20 Prem games a season in 8 years. Wasn't even a bonified starter for even one Prem win.  Hypothetically he may be considered but he'll be a low-tier legend if he even can be considered one. Casemiro played as a CB last year for a few games, shouldn't he be included too?  Such a dumb fucking list, man. Yes, €58.5m we paid for him, should be above Martinez. > they should count what position the buyer wanted him to play in.  That can change over time, so for the purpose of these lists the cleanest way to do them is to take the position they played at the time they were bought.   > Bellingham is another example.  Bellingham could well be classified as a CF/SS one day, then moved back to CAM, then DM, and each time he moves from 1 most expensive [insert position] list to another, it's impractical. /r/JustChelseaThings Gvardiol was placed immediately as a left back by Guardiola and has played 85% of the games in that position.   What makes you think Pep signed him as a CB and that wanted a CB when he signed Gvardiol?"

Seems like a very good deal for United tbh. Airdrop them directly onto Wembley Stay strong Bayern bros… 39m pounds for De Ligt is actually a very, very solid deal. 60 million euros before add ons for both is so much cheaper then i expected given how long it took but fuck me ill take it orny bomb fuck yeah finally Gives them 3 weeks to get rid of some players and actually sign a competent midfielder then. 😭  Show me the Doue Why are Bayern taking such a loss on de Ligt? Is it his fitness? Unreal Orny cluster bomb just dropped Oh Orny you filthy bitch It's gonna be an interesting year to watch PL as a Dutch person who doesn't really have a preferred club (other than city can fuck off). How does orny keep doing it Romano tap in incoming Finally. Now go get Doué, I want to really see what this hype is all about..   Edit: Go smash it at United, De ligt. You will be missed. Not bothered about Maz. We did a thing that isn't stupid! Great deals for United. INJECT IT Take care of him Man U  Should have been our future captain What a pair of signings. Now please stay fit United are cooking in this window Ornybomb always hits just right Hilariously stupid from Bayern to let de Ligt go, what the fuck is the strategy here? very excited for de ligt! but instead of mazraoui i would've liked ferdi instead tbh A decent price tbf, now they need to overhaul the midfield and they will be a force this season Good depth for Utd and Bayern get a couple of players who haven't done particularly well out the door. Good deal for both parties Why so cheap We are gonna buy the whole Bayern at this rate I really, really hope these numbers are incorrect. That's daylight robbery numbers. That's combined less than what Utd spent on Yoro, ffs. See what other premier league clubs are paying in transfer fees for mediocre players, that should be the baseline. This is a joke.  Mazraoui should be €25m+.  De Ligt should be €65m+. LETS FUCKING GO Lets goooo Seems like a really decent price for him. Am I missing something? [deleted] Great business. Jealous of this. big deal this definetely solidifies there defense That is actually in euros. Insanely good deals. My head has left the stratosphere oh myyyy This is so good for us.  Bayern loses their best defender and replaces him with Tah.  Leverkusen loses Tah.  I love it. Made my fucking weekend Only 50m?!?! This is absolute solid Signing Man Utd means business this season no doubt.. United are getting weirdly competent with their transfers. Its been a fun ride, watching from afar and laughing at their arrogant fans, but I feel like thats over now. Utd are making good signings. What is this??? Wtf? THATS a crazy good deal for united. Good value considering the current market My hands are in my pants Really want to know what Bayern fans think of that assuming the Addons are reached is €70m good value? Ajax United   I understand De Ligt, Mazraoui just seems like more Ten Hag obsession.  FUCK ME Nice!!!! 😊 ORNYYYYYYYYYYY Lets go!! Fucking get in,great news! Yoro, De Ligt and potentially Mazraoui is a hell of a window for the United defense That might be the bargain of the century  Can someone please tell me why Bayern are selling one of their best defenders? Horrific business from us, why are we so incompetent. Let's go! hope both stay fit. Win/win for both sides. Good business. What an odd odd odd saga. Weird move by Bayern. We’re so back (setting myself up for sadness) Can we get these completed before 3pm? So who is left from that Ajax generation? De Jong? Now United just need to sign another midfielder What a fantastic move As a Bayern fan, i hate this move. Just terrible. Bayern management are insane for letting De Ligt go. Very good deal for United, hopefully the injury curse doesn’t get to him too. Not too sure about Mazraoui, but let’s see if he’s a good replacement. This is a undersale from Bayern POV, both combined could have gotten at least 10/15 mil more. Ashworth doing bits I hate to see AWB go. He was my favorite Very soon you will hear about Man United‘s new and expanded sick bay facility Bayern fans, what does this mean for Dier? Honestly  quite shockingly great peice of business from us Bring in tadic now Can anyone explain why Bayern are getting rid of de Ligt?  Ornstein exclusives hit different pinch me what a fucking steal. WE ARE HAVING THE FM SEASON! De Ligtful So did Utd Win or did Bayern? I wait how those players turn out at United, got burned too often in the last couple of years when it comes to transfers Now you only need Ziyech :) Maguire and/or Lindelof out then? Immediately followed by an injury crisis and Evans Casemiro starting at CB. Why is Bayern selling him? Especially that cheap considering what they paid for him? Both are great players. Imagine if United manage to get Frenkie also then they are in a very good position but I don't think Frenkie will leave Barca until his contract expired Jesus Erik, you can't get the Ajax 18/19 team back together. Damn united cooking this season United on a roll. Maybe one of the best transfer windows in recent years. Yoro is the only one I can say United overpaid but he is a 19 year old with immense potential, so it's understandable.   What is Bayern gonna do now though. Tah deal seems to be off and haven't heard them being linked to a CB.  Edit: Yoro is 18* Not overly convinced on either of them but we need them especially de Light so I hope he can be a good partner for Martinez. Chelsea have the option to do the funniest thing Maybe this is why they didn’t sack ETH. Keep him on to get De Ligt at great value This is five years too late but welcome to Manchester United Matthijs De Ligt!!! And Mazraoui too! Are man united.. back? How’s United gonna line up next season? De Ligt + Martinez is an insane CB duo 45 mil for De Light ??? Utd Banter era coming to an end . Not sure this will work out. De Ligt isn’t very mobile so high line with him will be dangerous. Also not very good on the ball so playing out the back will be risky. my man was shipped out of 2 top clubs. good luck, I think... Not bad, they wanted 60 and we settled at 50. INEOS are cooking Mugs, bet he gets injured within the first month Absolutely incredible business by United here. They're now probably a defensive midfielder away from having a squad that should compete at the top end of all competitions they're in. Fuck off Yanited bailing Bayern out ffs. Bayern Munich has truly lost the tag ""German's Spurs"" in terms of negotiations.. Servus Desiré Doué. So Eric Dier is ahead of him at Bayern?? Yoro getting injured might have been the best thing to happen to united forcing them into getting De Ligt as well isn't wan bissaka for 15m a bit cheap? Guess the salary is high, but the transfer fee is a very good deal for ManU. Decent deals for decent players but Man United’s strategy of reassembling ten Hag’s Ajax side is weird - that’s now Onana, Martínez, de Ligt, Mazraoui + Anthony for over £200mil.   Can ten Hag just not get his ideas across to different players? Are Man United’s recruitment team just devoid of creativity? Feels strange to double down on signing players a manager has previously worked with when that manager only barely avoided the sack at the end of last season. Ajaxers…..  Assemble.   Or ya know something witty along those lines. Happy with this but at a point (that point being 1 Antony ago) this whole getting the band back together thing just becomes an absolute joke. Finally defence is sorted It’s a good deal for Mazraoui if they sell AWB I’m not really sure about De Ligt tbh, they have a lot of other issues to address not sure centre back was the biggest one. [deleted] De Ligt is such a textbook United signing lol Ten Hag trying to recreate his only success team. Frenkie next. [deleted] Fucking unimaginative from ten Hag. 😂😂😂 This is pretty much De Ligt’s last chance at proven he’s good enough for top flight football imo. I rate him, but he does have two obvious flaws in his game that either need to be ironed out or given patience, so far two big clubs didn’t deem him worthy of waiting. The EPL won’t be any easier. I want to know how much wages is being offered by man United I think both players are solid but not the highest level (anymore).  It's great deal, 'til they're both laid up in the physio's room for 35% of the season.  People said 30m was a great deal for Varane.  Edit: Forgot United are like the CCP. Gotta toe the line, even if you don't care.  This is the best deal ever! Chairman Erik is the reddest, reddest sun in our heart! All of football belongs to Manchester United! De ligt to PSG in 2027 Flopperino 50m with a 6y deal for someone who is a doctors wet dream lmao Maz for 20m is insane, so mufc fans can pretend they bought Mazraoui on the cheap. Feel bad for awb tho He’s gonna get sent off in his first game for united. Lol i thought Yoro would have regrets in 3 years not 3 weeks And injured Does anyone have a graphic/list of the players Ten Hag managed at Ajax then vs United now? I mean, some of them were and still are really solid players. Except for Antony of course. Imagine him bringing Daley Blind back to United. I'd kill to see this. And Dusan Tadic.  Benfica is also selling Neres Daley Blind part 2: the Dutch Boogaloo Right after Sneijder. Get Donny back as well! After gaitan Barca is selling him hard but the man will get his rightful deferred wages.  Barcelona are trying to sell him again but he doesn’t want to leave.  If we still had the budget I’d love to make another push but we couldn’t afford to finalize DeLigt until Wan Bissaka sale went through. I hope so man  £51m-£59m for those two players is fucking outrageous value imo I wasn't keeping track - did they end up paying the ""ManU tax"" or not? Seemed like Bayern was holding out for it. Because it is If they stay healthy yeah, if not then not really. Their wages won't be cheap either, especially de Ligts(he was/is on ~17M€ per year). I think all in all it is, but I do worry a lot about the midfield. They need at least one more athletic and disciplined defender in there. If they get Berge in, or even go a little bit more offensive and go Fofana, I'd say this was a deal worth completing.  But if this kills the hope for a midfielder then I'm a lot less optimistic about the deal given that United need this window. The De Ligt signing reeks of when Man U got Van De Sar way back in the day. Everyone (at least I think everyone) knew he was class, but he just needed the right club and circumstances.   I actually hate Man U, but I love that signing for them. Not really if they're matching De Ligt's Bayern wages The only possible slight on the De Ligt deal would be Utd giving Utd wages. Otherwise it looks a great transfer His wages are astronomic, but if he stays injury free, he'll be a beast. I was thinking it was a good deal for Bayern tbh, are either of these two any good? Thanks for your positive vibes.  For what it’s worth, Solanke is a solid pickup for you all. Considering your luck they'll get injured on their way down. [removed] De Ligt leaving after two seasons. Thats not how it supposed to go Too late! \#KompanyOut /s Now we can finalize Doué so we're happy :( One group of FCB bros has fallen, time for another one... And just like that Unitee upgraded from a permacrocked Varane, Maguire, Lindelöf, Martinez to Martinez, de Ligt, Yoro and Sir Jonny Evans Fucking Guehi is going for 75m Pounds, this is a bargain Yep, he might not be the best on the ball but he'll have Martinez next to him to compensate for that.  He is however a fantastic defender and will help them stop conceding so many silly goals. Wages I would imagine I keep seeing people say this but can anyone shine light on why Juve and Bayern were both happy to let him move on? He’s still young as well so doesn’t make any sense to me I think his wages are crazy though, probably contributed to the price. And is injury record. What about the wages tho? Makes you wonder what were they offering before this, I predicted him going for 45m plus add-ons weeks ago since it was reported that Bayern wanted at least 50m, it took too long to happen imo. Pletti also confirmed it so it’s a done deal Orny bomb > Here we go Probably just gonna be McTominay out and Ugarte/Berge in. Think targets are pretty much set now Doue signs for PSG after rejecting Bayern Here We Go? Will that doue Would be the only silver lining here Bayern got the bag 💰 Their wage structure is not good. He is on very expensive wages and they have a lot of other good CBs. They want to clear out his wage, I think. a few reasons, he's on big wages, he's not quite as good on the ball as Kompany would like and Bayern have a lot of other centrebacks so losing him doesn't really make much of a difference plus Bayern want to raise money for more priority positions It was probably because how expensive he was + salary and not getting the expected result  from a 67 mil CB. They are just clearing out Brazzo's masterclass. Way to high wages for being injured that regularly. Also not really the best fit for Kompany and therefore currently at best 3rd choice CB for us. The premier league is going to be a fucking blood bath this season jesus lol Absolute nuke 🤣💀 Can’t sleep until I know which agents brokered the deal https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/PaLiaAromP  🤣🤣 Was Mazraoui THAT bad? I get he was injured a lot and all, we're getting him as backup RB anyway. [insert meme about how this is new] I won't complain but I'd have much preferred a left-back over another RB. I know it's like for like with AWB leaving but time has shown that Shaw is injury prone and unreliable. It cant be Did he express the fact that he wanted to leave? Great on paper, let's hope they turn out just as well.  I thought we we're cooking the Sancho, Varane, Ronaldo, Heaton window as well. I guess it depends what else they do but the deals so far have been good.  That left side of there defence is looking thin though and midfield looks like a big issue. If I’ve learnt anything about united, they’ll start off the season ok and finish 6th, and these two will be part of the problem in 18 months time Only to finish 6th There must be something going on behind the scenes. A lot of people are going on about high wages but he's like 9th highest earner on their squad or something, so nothing too crazy. Plus they are taking a big loss on him so any savings go straight out the window. For some reason Tuchel didn’t play him and apparently he’s not in Kompany’s plans either…. Apparently we also want to save his wages but I hate this move The manager doesn't want him i guess.... Also too injury prone... > instead of mazraoui i would've liked ferdi instead tbh  He would also cost 2x and we don't have the funds for that If we’re not decimated by injuries we will have a strong team but I really think we need a year to build a strong base and to get a good bench. Heard you guys have a few of them to spare Came here to say the same thing. I think they met in the middle and that seems fair for both parties. Win, win. De Ligt has done well for them tbf Wages are insane 280k/week As long as its just the guys we want to get rid off anyway, no problem at all. Bayern were never going to get that much to offload him due to his wages it's good karma for our decade of overspending How are you determining those values? It’s obvious that nobody on the market was willing to pay that for either of those two Bayern didn't have much negotiating power I guess, United were the only one interested in de Ligt, and Bayern needed to sell. 45m for dw Ligt feels very cheap. He's a great player. Hope Tah comes good for you These numbers track with what the media has been reporting over the weeks, they had zero chance of selling De Ligt for the same amount they bought him for. He'll make a lot more than Yoro and Bayern wanted to get rid of him because of his wages right? And Mazraoui is injury prone, dunno why United are even after him with their injury luck. One might say that surely they can't all be injured at once, but then last year they all were injured at once. > De Ligt should be €65m+.  That really wasn't gonna happen, I'd say 55m would have been fair too but you guys did United a solid with this one lol You forgot the old Manchester taxe… 30 + adddons for mazraoui 75+addona for de ligt This only applies when both involved parties are on a leveled playing field. You showed your hand early, desperate to sell de ligt. Just signaling that you want to sell a player that you obviously shouldnt be selling told manU that they can fleece you on this one. Ive never seen a team scrambling so much to sell a player under value that they shouldnt be selling at all. Its so weird but ultimately self-inflicted. its way too much money. Wages fucked, need to sell.  His wages were high as shit and he's arguably the worst on the ball defender at Bayern. Over 3 years apparently We hope... We been all saying this for years Man, I hope we can achieve enough success that I can be arrogant again.  It was fun. They are literally just Ajax signings lol Fuck no. But it's what everyone wants, including the players, so I'm just glad it's (hopefully) over and we can finally look at our target Doue. It's not bad, a 70m package is what was reported that Bayern wanted weeks ago, I'm not bothered about the price tbh I just don't think Tah is the greatest replacement for De Ligt. No, that is a terrible deal! Some Bayern fans on reddit are just so high on the thought of signing Doué that they are happy to see starting players go on the cheap.  Bayern fans in Germany hate this. We are getting Maz for the same price AWB on his last year is being sold for. He can play LB too and is more well rounded than AWB and therefore would be quite helpful. His injuries are the biggest question mark. They want a back up to play RB and LB We were highly interested in De Ligt ages before EtH was on the scene  We wanted De Ligt years ago. He’s still only 24, pretty crazy considering where he’s been.   Yoro\De Ligt and Martinez is very good quality. Just worried about the liability behind him and if we can get a LB that wants to play, stays fit. Mazraoui was one of the best if not the best RB in Bundesliga, with a lower back injury. He can play RB LB, and he can also play IWB in a def of 3, he played DM a few games for Bayern and so many games for the national team too. He had 2 bad injuries, but he is really good. Don't forget Zirkzee Haven’t seen any of these 3 playing defense(and stay healthy) in the PL yet.. great on paper but we shall see. Because he didn't pass an excessive amount. That's basically it Nothing. He'll remain a solid backup behind Kim and Upamecano. If he repeats his form from last season, he may start the odd game. Just to add to this, I think he won't be doing as well as last year. Kompany is much more focussed on pressing. High wages, worst CB on the ball at the club, in need for funds for other positions and the only high earner who has any interest in him I imagine From Bayern's perspective they did but their fans think the exact opposite and us United fans think we clearly won Both did Tuchel didn't like him, Kompany doesn't like him and the board like him. Best bit? He's their best defender and hasn't fallen out with anyone He is 18 Slow down buddeh! he's 18 years old United have had a few 'great' looking transfer windows over the last few years and not done much so really need to wait and see how they do. Bayern signed Ito already and Stanisic returned from loan Yoro and Martinez when fit. MDL is the backup for both positions. Let us just have 15 minutes here man. We need it. We’re about to put a 4th string defence out against City, let us have this one. De Ligt's played in many high lines before it's a myth that he's extremely immobile especially compared to what we've already got in Maguire the difference between them two is night and day Concerning. But he’s going to his manager who he played probably the best of his footballing under. That was never reported, it was that they Wanted 50+addons, we wanted to pay 40+addons.  And we ended up meeting in the middle. Lol who wanted 60m? Nobody reported that, they said they wanted 50m plus add-ons, and got 45m Ok well slow down there buddy They're more than a player away from competing anywhere near City. Unfortunately I think only Arsenal and City are guaranteed to finish top 2. Rest of the League has multiple teams which could finish anywhere between 3rd to 8th. Spurs have a good team and a good manager, Liverpool too, Chelsea would expect more, Newcastle without European football would be better, West Ham have had a good window as well, there's Brighton and Palace as well We need three midfielders. Not even an exaggeration. Let’s not be too hasty here we are a Bruno, mainoo and Martinez shaped injury away from a complete system meltdown Steady now  Maybe the cups, it would have to be a supreme midfielder to see them get a CL spot and avoid all the injury issues from last season too.  Also I'm not sure they have dealt with the lack of goals issue they had. And a manager Lmao no. Still need a consistent LB who'd be available for more than 20 games a season, need another CM to replace Eriksen McTominay, another defensive CM to replace casemiro, and a wide player. You cannot rely only on Garnacho and Amad Their underlying numbers were comfortably bottom half last season. They'd do well to break into the top 6. [deleted] Always buying two CB.   I think it’s more fee and Bayern looking to get the lad from Bayer on the cheap, there’s no rush on the MDL transfer as he’s been at the Euros Given the fee, I don’t think the 2 transfers were related in any way. We just future proofed our CB position. One year left.   Limited footballer Devoid of creativity? We just sorted our recruitment team this year after decades of being operated in the footballing side by an accountant. De Ligt is still 24, so there are still potentials to unlock there. Maz is for backup across the backline.  Left back is still an issue. Aren’t both these guys massively injury prone? Are you sure? We only have 3 fit first team defenders and one of those is evans  I mean if it means we dont have to play Johnny Evans and.Maguire in defence again ill be happy They did need another CB if they can somehow sell Lindelof tbf Probably means one of Maguire or Lindelof is being sold.  Our defense will be De Ligt, Yoro, Licha and Maguire with Evans the last backup.  Agree that we have other bigger issues. We still need a DM but there are links with Ugarte/Berge and so on, so likely we get them before the end So if one of Martinez or Yoro gets injured, you know who plays? Maguire…then Lindelof then Evans We spent 1/3 of last season playing our 9th choice CB. We DEFINITELY needed two CBs this summer Recreate 2018 Ajax with a sprinkle of 2021 for ultimate vibes At the prices, we’d have wanted them regardless of Ten Hag imo. They both upgrade the positions we need to upgrade, at extremely good prices.  If the only complaint people can muster is a “banter” about them being ex Ajax, I’m happy. Lisandro/de Ligt starting CB until Yoro is back and get him back involved.   Maguire can cover either side. Evans same.  Dalot and Shaw will be starting fullbacks, Maz can cover both sides with malacia back in November is the current talk. How? A 24 (25 in two days) year old proven and experienced player with no ”United tax”. Sure he’s going to have high wages but surely a ”textbook United signing” is older and in a steep decline? Very much so BUT at a non textbook price, for a fucking change.   Woodward would have closed this at £75 million. RemindMe! 9 Months If that's what it takes then I'm all for it lol  Their fans wanted to keep De Ligt, so not sure they will be happy either way That was reported but that's only 5 mil difference. I really don't care about the price myself, if the club is happy with it it gets us Doué,vIm fine. It's not like it's my money. Bruh do you even know how negotiations work? If they report they want 50m it would be obvious they would get a bit less than that, Plettenberg reported Bayern wanted a 70m package and they got it. He was flawless at Bayern. Not a single fan is happy he is leaving. I reckon a cheeky Barcelona transfer after that Out here inflating fees I see lol We really aren't in a position to make this joke lol Onana  De Ligt  Martinez  Antony  Van de Beek  Am I missing any? Next is Gaitan Ay that's too far buddy We would need to sell Micky T for £40m to have any chance, or Bruno but fuck that Bruno stays for life. Me too, he is still young but with a load of experience. I imagine you saying this in an exhausted tone.  He’s got plenty of years still left in him & he’s definitely shown his value before. Ten Haag knows how to get the most out of him too, this definitely looks to be a great deal for you, financially fee wise and tactically It is 100 %. Bayern just needed to offload someone with value, and De Ligt is very valuable (he is still just 24 ffs), United took advantage of that situation, so got him for cheap. Not super cheap though. He can have his injuries. So how will you be lining up at the back? I have Dalot temporarily in my fpl team but Mazraoui would take his spot no? After a deace of overpaying for payers, this feels unreal. Aren't De Ligt's wages north of 200k p/w or more than 10M per year? That only gets you 2/3 of an Antony. Absolute steal this, especially for the quality of CB you re getting. They came down €5m, we went up about €4-6m. Was never really far apart in valuations the entire time £43m if we pay all the bonuses apparently. Idk price seems pretty fair to me for both players. Remains to see what wages MdL is on. Mazraoui I doubt would be earning extremely high wages They weren't holding out, these are realistic prices considering media reports Seems like we didn’t for once. Good to see. Maybe, but I think the 30 million reports were just negotiations tbh. Fair fee I guess considering Bayern were so open to selling. I'm fully expecting that he's injured in his first game...because that's just the United way at this point. its already been reported he's taken a paycut to want to join us, we'll be fine It was reported (don't know how true the report was) that he's coming in at a paycut to the tune of around €10m/yr. That was around the time of the reports of us agreeing personal terms. So about two weeks ago I'd guess. [deleted] While I agree. Casemiro actually looked good. If we can find a way to limit his minutes to keep him fresh I think we will be okay. Especially if colyer can contribute real quality minutes this season but that remains to be seen Still probably a lot less than we were paying Varane It's a very, very good deal for them. Find me a 45m CB that can perform at a world class level at this current market? While some English ones are getting value at 60-65m pounds Been reported for months that he is taking a pay cut, but it is ManU and this is Reddit. He is making 300k a week. Oi. With our luck this joke IS going to come true. Honestly just add them to the injury list now, saves me a lot of false hope Maybe he is a problem after all The optimistic take for Bayern fans is that Dier over performed rather than that de Ligt underperformed Only 2 seasons?! Why does it feel like soooo much longer I was pissed when we let Brazzo go, because I thought all things considered he did a decent job. Now in hindsight, he should be criminally charged Is there a reason Kompany wouldn’t want him? Am Ende kommt Tah 🤣 Legit happy that he's going there over PSG too. Anyone that goes to PSG right now and isn't an instant success would receive criticism for not being able to fill the huge void Mbappe left. That Martinez to Martinez upgrade gonna Hit hard Likely Maguire staying too. A very solid 4th choice Evans to school all of them, just like last season. Still need one more centre back but that can wait That's not fair to the player   A PL club has no rush to sell for 39m in scale to other leagues, I know Bayern are rich but still   Plus he's more essential to Palace , it would be scandalous to sell him for less than 40m 60mil pounds and Guehi has been performing top in PL you are wording it as he was a bum, with also much lower wages. Guehi is a top player. He is underrated because he plays for Palace Guehi will be earning nowhere near 250k+ per week. De Ligt is repped by Raiola (and now his successor), and gone from Ajax - Juve - Bayern to United. I would not consider it a bargain till you understand the wages/agent fee behind the deal. Guehi is better so it makes sense. Guehi is on 50k, you can give him 100k and still spend less on Guehi than getting De ligt Woodward and Co would have paid 70 million and higher wage Of course but he’s still only 24. Bayern wanted 50fixed then add one, united wanted to get to 50 with add ons. We probably wanted to do 40+5+5 or something, both meet mid way so it's fine. It would be malpractice to not make United wait and sweat a little before accepting their bid though, some of the old admin might still be around and you luck into an Antony situation. Ornstein confirming it generally already means it’s a done deal, regardless of Plettenberg Pletti is a spoofer. Ornstein is the only guy worth believing. attraction agonizing frame many hat market meeting party file insurance   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Who the fuck is Pletti? Ornstein is tier 0 If we can somehow get Ugarte on Loan and Berge signing.  We can try and get Eriksen sold as he had interest.  Casemiro honestly id release from hia contract.. we aint ever getting money for him We should try and offload Pellistri and Sancho. Not much use for them. Honestly would be United’s best window in years, you’ll actually have a midfield I hope we get Hermoso in on a free  De Ligt, Martinez, Yoro, Hermoso, Maguire is a great set up I’ll be very surprised if he does, we had to sell De Ligt and Nous to sanction any more deals, primarily the Doue one. No no, Bayern Sign Doue and PSG exchange Sancho for Ugarte.   Man can dream. Bayern has too much at stake in the Doue deal regarding their reputation, they will get it done no matter what imo They have Fuckupamecao and Eric Dier. Those are not good CBs. >they have a lot of other good CBs.  Define ""good"" Like dier Which is fine for us with Martinez next to him and Onana behind him. I mean he had one bad injury plagued season for you guys, even then he played 30 games. I don't think Licha and Shaw played 30 games combined last season. Manutd is used to a different level of injury proneness. Maybe DeLigt will rise to the occasion. As long as we all unite against 115  [deleted] A real hit and run It's not that he's bad, he's a fine player, a bit inconsistent but I think that's more to do with his injury history. What always bothered me he was constantly complaining (through his agent) about playing time, then contracted covid at the WC ( they didn't test for it there), had some kind of inflammation but kept playing at the WC. In turn he missed a couple of months, then didn't get in the first team and he again complained. He always had one foot out the door ever since he arrived. Yeah we need a left back, a midfielder or two (especially if we sell McTominay) and sell Sancho. Don't think so. Bayern just hated him for little reason that anyone knows of I remember the hype then. United had just finished second and signed one of the best young players in the world and two legendary players. People were predicting they'd compete for the PL title and maybe win it, and make a deep run in CL. Now people have hindsight bias and say it was a bad team and they were never going to get far blah blah. Maz can play lb as well Aye, if we sign a quality 6 I’ll be happy, won’t consider the window a success until we do, less concerned about LB because Shaw and Marazoui can both play there to a good level [deleted] One Lesley Ugochukwu on loan coming right up Gees that's almost what I earn That's maybe what he earns at Bayern. He apparently agreed to a wage cut to join United. Any chance you wanna get rid of Musiala? I’d love Muller this season but he wouldn’t fit in our system:/   Let’s go for Musiala you’ll be able to have Wirtz like that :) Any chance you want rid of musiala, tel or palhinha asking for a friend? Why are his wages such a problem though? He's reportedly 9th highest on the Bayern squad. Kane, Neuer, Muller, Sane, Kimmich, Gnarby, Coman and Goretzka all make more. When we bought De Ligt, he was already a bargain which was only possible because Juventus needed cash quickly. While he has not been the greatest CB in the world for Bayern, he has also not shown anything that would make him worth so much less now than 2 years ago. He is our best centre-back, was starting over Kim/Upa, is a leader on the pitch, and clear fan favourite.   There was also no need to sell. €45+5m is what we could have gotten for Upa. It's not about negotiating power, they wanted to sell to get rid of his wages, they knew from the beginning they were selling below market value, but saying they want 50m and getting 45m isn't terrible, achieving a sustainable wage structure is the goal here, and this is only the first step, there are a few big earners that are up for sale still but don't look like they are going anywhere this summer. He is worse than Upamecano? If he is it is going to be a problem. Na. This is different, profile of player has changed.     Younger and higher ceilings without overpaying. I hope I’m wrong because I like to laugh at United. Isn’t AWB £18 million? That’s more technically Yeah and as it has been, a player with links to ten hag becomes the default option.  I said I understand that one.  Who is the current LB for Ajax and does he fit the requirements? Because the PL is so so different Everybody wins in that case. Can’t be mad He’s not their best defender, they have KMJ Yeah. But they tend to overpay a lot too in those. Ito got injured recently, no. And might be out for some time? You don't sign De Ligt as a back up mate I think Yoro still needs a season or two under his belt, but he'll be the starter eventually. Feel the power of Jonathan Grant Evans MBE My bad lol Juve fair enough but Bayern staff just seemed to have it out for him despite being their best defender Basic negotiations, We wanted 40+add You lot wanted 50+adds  Met at 45+ adds  At the end of the day, it’s a good deal for Bayern, because they get his enormous wages off the books.   It’s a good deal for us because we get a good player for only 45 million plus addons.   Bayern probably edges out the win in this deal because it doesn’t matter if he becomes the next maldini at Manchester, his salary was untenable.  We take all the risk with buying him, although I do believe he will be a good purchase.  I don't think he means actual contenders How are you going to list Palace and West Ham but not Villa  And a LB, Shaw can't be trusted to be available for a whole season. Three good forwards. Our current forwards are substitute level if that.  A versatile backup is pretty important, seeing as we apparently can’t have a natural left back healthy for more than three weeks, and are selling AWB (leaving just Dalot as a consistent healthy fullback.) Mazaouri is versatile he can play left back Even if we don't sell him we kinda needed another CB. That lineup was basically my dream at the start of the window for CB.  Sign De Ligt and Yoro, try to move on Lindelof, keep Maguire and Evans another year.  Then next summer decide on if we want to release Maguire, or renew him as 4/5th choice if he wants it. taking Evans role, who really should be released at that point. That’s because of injuries, that could happen again November!!! The fuck happend to him, didn’t united think he would be ready in jan last year? And who's taken a significant pay cut to come here Antony, Pogba, Sancho, Maguire and Lukaku all fit that bracket too, bar maybe the United tax part, but then again it would’ve been hard to pay over the odds for a player Bayern have actively been trying to flog.   Not saying it’s a bad signing, but the whole “INEOS doing things differently” doesn’t really wash imo, time will tell I guess. He wasn’t flawless I watch Bundesliga almost as much as La Liga, which is why I know he has two major flaws. He’s a good defender, but not above criticism. Ultimately he hasn’t quite lived up to the generational tag he got at Ajax, and that’s why he hasn’t stuck for a big club yet. Was about to say this.. Isn't vd Beek gone and you got him in before Ten Hag regardless? Add Mazraoui if you get him. Eriksen also ex Ajax but not during ETHs time there Yea dude has an elite resume from ajax to Juventus to Bayern to United. Always wanted him at barca but :( [deleted] Liverpool supporter reassuring a United supporter.  We really are living in a new age. I love seeing sensible decent posts from rival fans on here as it rarely happens We all said it collectively in an exhausted tone >I imagine you saying this in an exhausted tone.  Every player we buy somehow get injured soon after starting for us and its just so tiring In before bilateral ACL ruptures and sudden calamitous loss of form.  De ligt has shown a lot more and the fee is more reasonable, but theoretically couldn’t you have said the same thing about Antony? Genuinely curious. I know it’s more of a money situation but does he not fit into the tactics ? Or is he genuinely not as good as the other cbs in the squad ? Naah should be Dalot first choice to start the season. Shaw's a doubt for the start so Mazraoui might play LB.   Later in the season yea could be a fight between Dalot and Mazraoui for the RB spot but all depends on Shaw being fit on the other side otherwise both would play Dalot was probably our best player last season, doubt he isn't one of the first names on the team sheet tbh. Dalot is probably the 4th most locked in player on the teamsheet behind Bruno, onana, and licha. Just depends on if he starts at left back or right back. I really can’t see maz taking his starting spot and even if he did it wouldn’t be until well into the season. Yeah it’s been a crazy deace United had one of the best wages to turnover ratios in the league and it's only gotten better with big earners leaving. They have no problem affording it and 200k per week while enormous outside of the PL it's reasonable for someone of his experience and quality at a club like United. We just got 250k a week back from Martial, and 340k from Varane.   I'll take two more De Ligt's please. So basic negotiations, fair enough. Sounded like Bayern were going to play hardball, but they settled. It sounded like both sides had a strong need, so it was just a matter of if someone was going to be stubborn about it. Pletti reports both bonuses are ""easy to achieve"". Capology has de Light on €307,692/week at Bayern. Mazraoui on €153,846/week. But a fair price today doesn't last forever - it's always interesting to see how clubs manage the long play, and you guys have done poorly in recent years esp (CFC is all over the damn place, I feel you), so I'm interested to see if this really is a new regime for you. They were asking €50m + addons Our new cb is injured before the first game.... Players at his age usually don't take paycuts. You guys probably pay him a higher sign on fee to keep his wage lower. Yeah this is unlikely, any source? Seems unlikely truth be told.  EDIT: If anyone has a reputable source I'll gladly eat my words. Source? I keep seeing people saying this but haven't seen any sources. Source? To live in the rainy North of England and play on thursday nights, in a sub-par stadium? Not exactly title challengers, either. A positive GD this year is as good as it's getting in the league, perhaps....   Yeah, not likely he's taking a massive pay cut. He's getting paid more. I don't know how it works in the UK but here it is dependent on their contract and the length of the injury. Basically a lot of(if not all) players have special clauses that the club will continue to pay the wages for months(to basically cover any ""normal"" injury completely).  The insurance companies also only would be paying if the injury is longer than 6 weeks and that already excludes mosts injuries anyway. Using Varane's ridiculous wages as measuring stick is still not a good basis for reality of a good deal.  De Ligt will still be earning like £[250k per week](https://x.com/imiasanmia/status/1800203104610316415?s=46&t=XjFJdb0BwuKUGA-CalIcOg) if you match his salary, making him one of the best paid CB's in the league. How much were you paying Varane? De Ligt is on €16m per year I think. Compounding a bad deal with another one.   Why not go for Tah I mean it seems like he is ready to move on quickly when things are not looking absolutely perfect for him, but he is/was our best defender the last 2 seasons If he is we'll find out this season. The Man United dressing room is about as leak-proof as Titanic post iceberg. yea i'm confused why Juventus and Bayern, both top clubs known for having tons of long term legends, have decided to move on from him for relatively reasonable prices. young center backs are like one of the most expensive and hard to find players you can buy [deleted] well the contracts stink a bit... Angeblich will man weiterhin beide Hopefully a switch from permacrocked Martinez to regular Martinez Tbf having Martinez actually fit would be an enormous upgrade on last season You joke but injury hit Martinez < Copa winning Martinez Yeah, would be nice if we could offload Lindelof instead No matter how you look at it, Guehi is not and will never worth 75m pounds.   Yes he's essential for palace and fair play to them for getting that money, good job; but so was Maguire who's also very essential for Leicester back then. Bayern is richer than Palace and got De Ligt for a 67+10 fee just 2 years ago. I dont understand how this fee makes any sense for them, its not like De Ligt was playing poorly, at least in the champions league he looked like their best cb. Yeah, HG plus a sale within the league plus just has a higher stock than De Ligt right now. Still a good deal for United, but Guehi will be worth the money too. Indeed. Plus English tax De ligt is a more proven player De Ligt also won't be earning £250k+ a week Nobody ever factors in the fact the wage of the player is even more important at times   And can end up being a cheaper deal in the long run He's definitely gonna get way more than 100k But there’s no chance Guehi is moving for £70m and only being on £100k a week, if he’s worth £70m he’ll be getting paid like a £75m player Bayern: we'd like 52 mil for De Ligt  Woodward: 70 and not a penny less It's the other way round, we were waiting for AWB sale. WHU have moved today, that's why this is out. Ornstein is the best 100% correct every time. Ornstein is even better than Fabrizio Romano He was literally the first one to report Bayern wants to sell and United is the top target… Eriksen is staying til his contract ends. Can't get around that one. Casemiro may be the same situation unless Saudi comes back for him Casemiro has been captain all summer, and looks fitter and sharper than last summer (where the whole squad was a complete mess)   He’s become an easy target (like always) and put someone alongside him that compliments him works out well (see Fred).  There are bigger squad issues than him. Releasing Casemiro would cost around 36 mill. Never happening. What's the point in releasing him? You would need to buyout his contract. Casemiro has actually dropped weight and looked pretty good Dier did pretty well but still De Ligt is by far their best CB in terms of ability. But well, United should thank Bayern for this one, especially if De Ligt remains fairly fit And Kim. Tah should be coming in as well. And this guy didn't stand out among that crowd. It's not a glowing review. Oopsamecano is my personal go to Dier was the most reliable one after he joined I’ve never heard Fuck-upamecano before, love it > They have Fuckupamecao  How is this the first I'm hearing of this hahaha Upamecano, Tah, KMJ, Dier is a fine CB room. I’m assuming Tah will join now. Just need to do something about the layer in front of him now Longterm martinez will be benched People go ""injury prone"" way too fast these days. Injury prone is guys who are constantly out with muscle injuries imo. Robben is the prime example. De Ligt afaik got his leg caught up on a tackle on a bad pitch and hurt his knee, just an unlucky impact injury. depends where arsenal are in the table I am excited to watch you guys play in about an hour lol don’t care who wins honestly, just need my fix lol I’ve missed it dearly 🫡 We are mocked for our absurd transfer spending, but when you need cannon fodder in the war against City, the rest of you guys are going to look pretty foolish when your club can only supply 3 or 4 goalkeepers. United against 115 😂 next year you will be rooting for them, like last season. Surely they got money for the city financial group Yes his attitude annoyed me so much. When his head was in the game he was a very decent player. But more often than not he was just complaining about not being a guaranteed starter (my man, you are playing at Bayern now, nothing is guaranteed) and then backed up his words with absolutely nothing once he got some playing time, sometimes being the worst player on the pitch. Wow such a smart and edgy comment, so cool.   Could also have been because we needed to free up wages and sell players to make room for improvements, and he is one of the in-demand players we can actually afford to sell. Others on buffed-up wages aren't in demand or would rather run down their contracts. My view at the time was that we really needed a DM to break up the McFred combo, but getting Varane in to replace Lindelof would cover that weakness enough.  I was wrong. So can Dalot but they didn't look right when he did. The only proper defensive midfielder there is Casemiro, who was poor last season Out of those only Mainoo is really good enough to be a top 4 starting mid. Just like 278k a week more than me. I'll get there eventually frfr Source? If Bayern sold Musiala, fans would burn the Allianz Arena to the ground I have the feeling that Musialas ambitions dont quite match with what you guys can offer sporting wise Only because they all make a shit tonne as well lol, he’s on much more than the other targets for United No way would anyone call 70m for a defender a bargain, come on now.  United where the only club interested. If some other rich clubs had joined in then maybe Bayern could have squeezed more money out of him, but all big clubs want a defender who can pass well nowadays. >He is worse than Upamecano?  Absolutely not Technically wrong because their wages are insane It says 15m in the tweet, so I was being conservative. Well not the Bayern fans. They're very pissed off Tell me u didn't watch bayern last year. kmj isnt that good mate.. Yes, but he'll be back in October so its fine. The Tah deal isn't completely off either, there were some conflicting reports. I think it will get done Well we are.   Yoro and Martinez are first choice.  They’ll be enough games. ""compete at the top"" suggests so even if not favourites in my opinion. Genuinely just forgot about then but yes, they've had a terrific window as well Agreed, but Maz and Dalot can both play both flanks, we have no midfield, though, barring Mainoo. Playing a good not great right back out of position isn't really having the back 4 ""sorted"". We got rid of Varane and bought in two new CBs so it's less likely Yeah they are taking it really slow supposedly. Was a proper horrendous injury. I don’t think Antony fits the ”proven and experienced” part. Also please don’t overestimate us. In the past, we could definitely have waited too long with signing MDL and then crawl to Bayern with a £70m offer on deadline day. The United tax is one of the biggest things about a ”textbook united signing”, we seem to be moving away from that What are his flaws? VdB was here already yeah, and he barely ever played under TH.  When he went to juve wasn’t his decision between you and them or am I misremembering? It might be a red flag that all these teams are selling himp High wages and doesn’t fit well in the starting 11. Makes sense to let him go for a fee than to sit him in the bench. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them Don't be tricked, he is trying to jinx it As a Liverpool fan outside of UK, I never really understood the whole thing of calling people scum just because they're fans of your worst rival team. Well, whoever follows Man United knows that for 95% of the hyped players they signed in the last decade or so, the day that people were commenting on the player the most positively was the day when he was signed. Really became the norm that that's the peak moment.  Probably easier to believe in it changing for people who don't follow the club much. Game's gone. Game's gone Same. Honestly, it’s a little exhausting being a hater. Bayer is doing a big rebuild, and De Ligt is pretty easy to sell, as I said, he is valuable. He is one of the heavier pay checks. But on the sporting side of things it doesnt make much sense to get rid of him Mathijs of all people, I guess Kompany is confident with what hes got? Hope so since he just sold 2 of young quality defenders. Lol ... I should really proof read....   Meant decade!!!! They made it far too obvious they wanted rid of him so yeah. Not sure why it took so long to just meet in the middle for such an obvious deal where all parties wanted it though Well, if there are any appearance bonuses then they certainly aren't easy considering our injury curse, lol Obviously you can’t judge until a player has had time to perform but none of our purchases have been blatant robberies like in previous years. So many transfers had everyone shaking their heads at the inflated fees we were paying, ie maguire 87 mil, AWB 55 mil, Fred 59 mil, and Antony 95 mil were all obviously given at a “man Utd” tax price.   These transfers all seem pretty reasonable. In prior years we also seemed unwilling to move on when a team didn’t want to sell. Now we are completely willing to move on the plan B if plan A isn’t working Paycut doesn't means he doesn't get a shitload of money. He gets 17 mill now, he may get 15 (10 base according to rumours plus some bonus payments) now, has a paycut and is still a high paid player. Did a quick google and it apparently comes from Christopher Michel.  Whether he's reputable or not, who knows? Everything is true on the internet bro Which would be fair enough since he'd be one of the best CBs in the league normally Varane was on £350k a week (yes seriously) so even if we matched De Ligt's current wages (250k if I'm not mistaken) it would be a saving kind of. I hope we aren't paying him 250k though. I do remember seeing reports he'd be open to a wage cut to join early on, but that may have just been our mouthpieces spinning ofc. Varane was on \~  £340K/week about  £17.5M/year, so a lot more https://fbref.com/en/squads/19538871/2023-2024/wages/Manchester-United-Wage-Details  Varane was on ~21M Euros per year LOL To start with, De Ligt is 4 years younger and also won the top Dutch, Italian and German leagues already, plus was ETH's Ajax captain.  And with the price we're getting that seems pretty worthwhile instead of Tah. didn’t see Bayern last season much, isn’t 45m quite low? > but he is/was our best defender the last 2 seasons  I love him as a player and if he played most of the times, like he did in the second half of his first season, I would kiss his feet, but he was mostly average last season and domestically he looked bad rather often.  Bayern has two major objectives this season, fix the wage structure and compete for the CL final in Munich, after that, they are set up for a rebuild, with contracts of Neuer, Müller, Kimmich, Goretzka, Gnabry & Sane among others running out, most of them are in the 15-20m bracket, the last three haven't been performing to their standard for most of the past two seasons. Flipping MdJ gets him of the books and generate funds for the rebuild, its a sensible transfer. He wanted to stay. The club wanted to sell him because his wages were to high. To be fair with de ligt he didn’t ask to leave. Bayern told him he’s not in their plan and needed to go. I mean it isn’t really his fault right? Bayern wants Tah badly for whatever reason and they are too loyal to Upa and they just signed Min-Jae and Dier, so de Ligt ends up being the unlucky one who draws the shortest straw We were bleeding money post-COVID and post-Ronaldo and had to make sacrifices to balance the books. De Ligt was signed for Sarri's team with the idea of playing possession-based attacking football. When that didn’t work, we made a last-minute decision to bring in an inexperienced Pirlo, sold Ronaldo the next season, and then brought Allegri back.  De Ligt was understandably disappointed by our lack of a clear project, and that's not the player you want to have around under those circumstances. Especially with other teams interested and willing to pay the 70m price tag. It's a shame because he and Bremer could’ve been interesting to watch. yeah, his huge salary and so far he hasnt kicked into the elite gear which people would've expected considering the level he started at at Ajax Dachte Tah ist vom Tisch? Honestly I think he’ll be fine.  Last year he came into the season with the metatarsal and then came back only to have someone fall on his knee.  Unless that caused a recurring problem that he didn’t have before, I don’t see any reason that he shouldn’t stay fit this season like he did for most of 22/23.    If he stays fit all season and we consistently have one of De Ligt/Yoro, and one of Shaw, Mazroui, Malacia, I think that we could be significantly stronger this season One of our best players. He’s integral to how we play World Cup winning Martinez was quite a time to be a fan tho. He and Rashy came back mint... My sentimental ass is still sad because I love Victor, he’s been around since Mourinho’s 2nd season and all indications are that he’s a superb bloke. Got to go, unfortunately. If you were Crystal Palace CEO/ In charge etc, how much would you sell him for? Its quite imple, two premier league teams dealing vs two non premier league teams. The markets are completely different.  Fees will always be inflated like that whilst the money gap between the prem and all the other leagues is as large as it is. He's on massive wags and none of Bayerns CBs were great in recent seasons. Considering that they need sales to finish other transfers I think it makes quite a bit of sense to get rid of De Ligt Bayern want to sell, Palace don’t, that’s the main factor. I think the point is that United are getting a great deal on De Ligt, but given the element of home grown status value and Palace having PL money therefore not needing to sell, Guehi is going a little above value. Both are still great CBs. Did very well, for his age, at Ajax. Struggled with performances, dropped and sold by the two teams he’s played for in the top 5 leagues and doesn’t start for his national team. Proven how, exactly? He earns [approx €288k per week at Bayern](https://x.com/imiasanmia/status/1800203104610316415?s=46&t=XjFJdb0BwuKUGA-CalIcOg). Some other sources even report higher.   Have you got a source as evidence that he's chosen to take a big pay cut to join United? What makes you say that? Yeah, but United's wages to turnover ratio is amongst the lowest in the league (if not the lowest). They can certainly afford a player of De Ligt's quality especially when the transfer fee is £38.6m Isak is on 120k, Gordon is on 60k and getting a new contract might be 120-150k. Newcastle has a strict wage policy, their starting contract won't be high, tonali was at 120k same for isak and bruno. It will be the same or very similar for Guehi, he won't cross 120k   Newcastle has a strict wage policy—they only increase salaries based on performance. For example, Isak earns £120k, Gordon £60k, and Bruno is the highest-paid player at £160k. There's no way Marc Guehi would get £160k on his first contract; the maximum he could expect is £120k, which is the highest Newcastle offers new signings.  Our last bid for Guehi was £50 million. Let’s say we agree on a deal for £55 million plus £5 million in add-ons, and his salary is doubled to £120k on a five-year contract. His gross pay would be around £6.2 million per year, making it £31 million over the length of the contract, plus the £55 million transfer fee and add-ons.  This means we’d be spending £86 million plus add-ons for his entire contract.  Now, let’s compare this to how much De Ligt would cost Manchester United. He’s valued at £38.5 million plus add-ons, and currently earns £260k a week. If he gets £225k (more than Antony but less than Mount), that would be £11.7 million per year, totaling £58.5 million over five years.  In total, they’d be spending £97.5 million plus add-ons for his entire contract.  Keep in mind, Guehi isn't injury-prone and is an English international. He’s a safer bet for Newcastle than De Ligt at this point and aligns better with the club's goals.  Edit : even if De Ligt is on 200k, still it's more than Guehi's total money and iam sorry manU fans got their butt hurt because someone chose to speak reality, delusional fans can't even accept simple maths Woodward: “You drive a hard bargain Mattjhis, we will offer you £350k a week.”  MDL: “I only asked for £200k a week” Romano doesn't break news usually, he only reiterates what other people say, gives constant non-updates and presents deals after being confirmed. If you want to see exclusives Romano isn't usually the person to break them (even if lately he has shared more exclusives while also promoting the agency behind them) The way you phrased it suggested it is a done deal because Plettenberg reported it, but Ornstein reporting it (which is this post) already means it’s a done deal. So saying Plettenberg confirmed it so it’s true is superfluous. Saudi will come when they need more media attention/big player names No his legs are gone He’s the best pure defender, but he’s really not that great with the ball.  Ironically, Upa might just be the best build up CB in the Bundesliga. Sucks he has so many moments..   Bayern are playing a 4-4-2 next year tho, so they probably think they don’t need the non-plus ultra defender if they have the sheer numbers Tah is not going to Bayern. De Ligt was by far their best CB, this transfer makes no sense. Don't forget Ito He did though, he was Bayerns best player before terror Tuchel joined. He was their best one to be fair Yikes. No wonder they didn’t win the league for the first time in 800 years. Ito was good at Stuttgart too but out awhile now Ugh couldn’t agree more By whom? He is by far the most elite defender that we have How long term? No chance, a fit Martinez and De Ligt will be the first choice, Yoro might be second once he's fit but I won't be surprised with Maguire either Being pickpocketed by Arteta's army of pro pickpockets?  Football is back baybay. Scared yet excited at our fixture list which is honestly crazy for a starter run lol. EtH has a lot to prove. This game might be a bit odd though with the injuries (surprise, surprise) >Wow such a smart and edgy comment, so cool.   What? 😭💀😂 You weren't alone in thinking like that, it was the prevailing opinion that United had built a very strong team and signed 3 big players to take them to the next level after finishing second. Now with hindsight bias people don't admit that they were excited about it and say it was a poor team and they were always going to underperform but that's now. Back then people thought it was going to work out super well Bruno is as well. Rumours on Twitter, but let's wait for the deal to be confirmed. Honestly, I would drive the 60km to Aschaffenburg start there, and burn my way through the whole of Bavaria til I reach Austria. Okay… how about kane? Take our starboy rashford.. Seems like a fair deal Only for now and hopefully it changes very very quickly. Is he that bad in passing? He is going to be 3rd choice at united once everyone is fit. Disagree, on the ball is a definte weakness of him Upamecano is better imo. De ligt probably is worse on ball, there is no way he would put worse performance than Upamecano in that city match. I’ve not looked at the wages, but I’m guessing they are less once inflation is adjusted then say, Falcao, Di Maria, Schweinstiger, Casimero, Varane etc. That reaction at least gives me some hope these players might workout if they see them as more valuable that what they went for Oh ok. The last report I saw said something like Leverkusen won't sell if Bayern won't buy in a day or two or something. Yoro is like 18. Very little chance he’s first choice over MDL. He's not going to be a starter when everyone is fit and he's good with both feet. Aggression/positioning. Sometimes he’s just too aggressive for a CB that’s heavy footed. He isn’t a snail, but he’ll often go for the ball and end up with a gap in space behind him or a skillful attacker will straight up get around him somehow, and he can’t recover.   He’s also prone to a yellow. Will be interesting as I believe he can flourish in a more physical EPL, but he’ll have to temper it some as it’s a double edged sword. He’ll be playing better attackers on a match to match basis.   His passing is quite mediocre hence why he was benched last year. He’s an old fashioned CB which isn’t a problem, but his ceiling is more or less capped because of it. He isn’t so good at defending where his passing make up for it so when he’s not in form he’s quite expendable.   Outside of those things he pretty much checks off all the boxes, aggressive, not afraid to put in a challenge, strong and robust, pretty good in the air, etc… I think he’ll be good for United but I doubt he transforms their backline. Motherfucking pique told de ligt not to sign for Barca cause he wouldn't get first team minutes. Our backline back then was umtiti lenglet and pique, hindsight 20/20 but it was thought that those three were more than enough. And then umtiti and lenglet fking died. Also he got higher net wages in Juventus [deleted] You have to want the thing in order to jinx it.  Otherwise I could just say “City and Liverpool will win more titles in my lifetime” and have a blessed life We just call Liverpool the club “the scum” not individual supporters Appreciate the insight! It’s a good sign for us at least that many of your fans don’t seem happy about selling him.   I’m always weary of buying players from Bayern or Madrid(unless they are young guys just looking for more playing time) because those two clubs usually seem to know the right time to move a player on when they start declining. We’ve definitely been bit by that a few times Thanks for not editing the original comment, it’s funnier this way ;) Dont worry too much.  I didn't even notice the mistake.  My brain autocorrected it into decade. Think it was very dependent on us moving Wan-Bissaka or a different player. Gonna miss that dude. Why did they want rid of de Ligt though   I was under the impression he was the best defender at the club Yeah, that's basically my curiosity point - you make it obvious that your guys are goners and then you expect to extract the ""tax"" as they go... I guess they half-heartedly tried, but common sense kicked in. We needed to sell didn't we? Both are injury prone but they'll manage to reach them in a couple of years...I hope. There was Mount last year, but it does seem like things are getting more reasonable. CFC were famous for overpaying salaries, but now that's ended, as we didn't really consider Nico Williams... we'll see if Osimhen comes on a reasonable salary - I think he'll opt for PSG. I can't bring myself to rate someone benched by Eric Dier. De Ligt is currently nowhere near better than Ruben Dias, Stones, Van Dijk, Gabriel, Saliba.   ou could definitely argue others for being better than him too. And not too long ago there was also De Gea on about the same or a bit more lol. I think he was on about double the next highest-paid keeper in the PL  The wage structure (if I can call it a structure) was beyond fucked His wages is the issue. Juventus didn't feel he's worth it, and neither does Bayern. He's still living off of Ajax days. Can't even start for the Netherlands By United recent standards, 45m is basically bargain basement  Pretty sure United paid more for AWB lol and that was years ago If you consider how expensive Maguire was, 45 Million is a crime that should not go unpunished we paid something like 80mil for him so 45 is low, but De Ligt wants to go, Bayern wanted to sell, he has a very high salary for a defender, plus Kompany doesn't want him according to rumours. Bayern's selling potition was quite weak. hard to negotiate when one of the club\`s directors publicly said that he has no future at the club They wanted off his wages Its not really a „flip“ when you buy him for nearly 70 million and sell him for 45 million 2 years later. Thats a loss I know that he didn’t ask to be sold, or asked to leave but as soon as there were reports that Bayern would be open to selling he quickly reached an agreement with United Don’t get me wrong, i would have personally  thrown every other defender out if it meant that Mathijs stayed. For me, he was our future captain Gibt verschiedene Berichte dazu. Andere Medien (glaube Sky zB) schreiben, dass man auch Tah weiterhin will Our team is gonna be a lot less handsome on average once he leaves Handsome fucker too. Wouldn’t you just want him to play regularly at the end of his career? Decent bloke, decent player superb prof. I don\`t know if he picks his looks or his wife do it for him, but he has the best drip in the club. Dude could part ways with us and sign Hugo Boss deal the next day Ofc I would look to recoup as much as possible, though as a neutral I'd judge player's price by how much I would pay for them while still considering the importancy, club's situation, or timing.   If I were Newcastle's rep for example, and I have Botman and Schar fully fit and I think they're still dependable to start in any game, I wouldn't pay Guehi past 40m. If one or two of them leaving or unavailable for long period then I would prepare like extra 10m-15m. But if it's already a deadline day on top of that unavailibility of current player, then perhaps I can consider 60m is still a fair price. Just say that you didn't watch him. No need to look stupid. He didn't struggle with performance. He was one of the best players at Juve but had to be sold due to financial stuggles (he was also open to leaving or even wanted to leave). Then he was one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga in his first Bayern season before being injured for multiple months in his second season. [Here you go mate. No clue if it’s accurate but here is a source for his alleged paycut](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/netherlands-star-willing-pay-cut-140000468.html) Have you got as source as evidence that he's going from a 288K euro to £250K a week? How much did Guimaraes sign a new contract for?  Will Tonali finally play this season? ""Ok fine! £350k + £200k in bonuses"" I remember I used to follow so many transfer related accounts but most of it was engagement crap. Then I found Romano's account and it was the only one I needed to follow after then. Would be sad to see if hes fallen off. He still has value you just have to remember each one of his sources is an agent or club with an agenda and it colors his “news” Incredibly well said brother Hes not gonna shag you mate With the way people talk about de ligt your swear he was the second coming of beckenbauer De Ligt was a CB for us during a season where we nearly lost the title race and the season where we lost the title for the first time in like 13 years. Despite all the fan boy views of him he did not improve our defense, he did not fit the tactics, he did not improve the team, and he cost way too damn much money for little to no impact. I didn't mean now. Overall de Ligt is better, and Yoro has the edge heightwise. People act like height doesn't matter but it does I always hated Ronaldo signing. We only got him because City showed interest or else united would have never ever gotten involved. Sir, we at United still want our trophy here.....unless.....deal with the devil is the only way for Kane to end his curse? I highly doubt that very limited and safe, probably the main reason clubs like Arsenal City Barca RM weren't interested tbh Fair enough then. I heard from people who watched him at Ajax say he was actually alright on the ball compared to what people say about him now but maybe it was just a thing of moving up leagues His game against City was an absolute disaster Its bad bro 😭 >at least gives me some hope these players might workout  How shit do you think De Ligt and Mazraoui are? 😭💀 Child me just sort of assumed it was the norm. We just called that the status quo. I was born in 91, it was all I'd ever known He earns a massive wage, has missed a fair few games through injury and they prefer to use KMJ/Upa/Dier > I was under the impression he was the best defender at the club  Some Bayern fans on this sub would have you believe that  I don't think his performance level at Bayern actually justified that hype, esp last season (where funny enough Dier looked like a better version of him at times) Reminds me of Nobita declaring ""everyone is on the market except for Pedri, Fati, FDJ and Messi"" after the 8-2 and basically making no worthwhile sales. Seems like we needed to shift AWB to make the double swoop. Idk if we needed to sell just for de ligt Good then that he wasnt. More upa and kim that was Good thing you're not a scout then. Well can’t really argue with you there. Always felt he never really kicked on after Ajax especially since he hasn’t  been able to break into the starting line up of the national team.  But my cope is saying surely there must be a reason by top clubs keep continuing to want sign him but then again you can also say that they  also don’t mind selling after two seasons.  Hopefully Ten Hag van bring the best out of him like before. Lol he's definitely close to or as good as the players you mentioned. De Ligt has been easily one of the best CBs in the world for the past few years now. Just because Bayern can't pay his salary anymore doesn't make that any less true. Yup we paid 50m _pounds_ > If you consider how expensive Maguire was, 45 Million is a crime that should not go unpunished  He made 15m annually plus boni, they are trying to fix the wage structure. When would his contract have ended? De Ligt never wanted to go until our board told him he is for sale. Did you seriously pay 80? Not like Bayern to make bad moves. > we paid something like 80mil   67 including easy obtainable boni, 72 at max. You can also flip something at a loss, it refers to selling something quickly, not making a profit.  He is one of the few players on the list, that Bayern don't want to extend and has somewhat high value. You also have to account for wages in that case, wich are a major reason they're letting him go. If you want to be pedantic about the languange /u/OilOfOlaz uses then maybe you should be precise with your own use. Technically,  the sale is the opposite of a ""loss"". After two years of an anual amortization of 14 million his value in Bayern's books is 42 million which is less than 45 million. That's a profit. I just think it is sad personally. He seemed like a perfect fit and he was also the best when he was available. Just unfortunate Have you seen MdL? He legit could be in a boy band haha I do watch him. Rich man’s Eric Dier. Reputation far greater than his ability. Why did he not start for the Netherlands? That is not a credible source at all This cannot be a serious comment You know that currency conversions aren't 1:1.... right? right!? Fucking simple shit this, mate. Sort yourself out. I am not providing you a source for the simplest of information. You've seen a bureau de change before. 160k Yup, his ban ends next month, he can start against spurs Romano is still pretty much 100% correct with everything he says. Ehm, what?  Did you mean to respond to someone else? I think your “crisis” last season cannot be pinned on any individual player at all, what did you expect that a single club would just keep dominating forever? Had to happen sooner or later and was mostly caused by management decisions. Maybe he isn’t a world class CB but within the squad he was definitely among the best. And it’s not like you seem to be replacing him so I still don’t understand this transfer. Would make sense if someone better is coming but I haven’t heard anything about that. Fucking hell people are still arguing about this? Load of waffle There's still people to this day who swear Ronaldo turned City down but that never happened. City were negotiating with Ronaldo/Juventus but there was no agreement. United swooped in and agreed to all of Ronaldo's and Juventus's demands. Really what they should have done is taken the same strategy as City - wait and see and *maybe* sign him for the right money/role. But they panicked when they thought he could go to City. Let’s see. Probably why Yoro was our first choice and when everyone are fit I think he will be 3rd choice at best. Don't get me wrong De Ligt is IMO the better pure ""Defender"" but his passing is limited.  I think it is a case of League step-up plus he was still young then so people imagined the passing could still improve quite a bit but that wasn't really the case from what I saw last season at least. Never seen a player have that kind of mental breakdown in a match before. I would prefer a player to have a limitation than crumble like that mentally in an important game. Utd are always gonna bring in talented players but it’s always about whether they’ll work out or not Basically young me assuming we'd win the CL/get to the final every year after 94-97 God I hate you so much for this lmao.  All I knew was stories of glory and the misery I was seeing in front of me when H&G were in charge of the club.  Everything between Benitez and Klopp was just kind of shit. Same age here. Definitely something that I took for granted when I was younger. Just assumed the good times would never end >Dier  This is still funny to me more than half a year later. Also got Ito (although currently injured), Stanisic and soon Tah. Don't think it's that last bit because De Ligt was their best defender last season so why get rid of someone like that? I think it's financial + he may have expressed a willingness to leave Not true. De Ligt was also benched by Dier earlier in the 2nd half of the season. Actually quite funny that all Bayern defenders got benched because of Dier. This is either ignorance or delusion. Oh brother 2027 If you just want to break it down into financial terms and stuff i have no real clue about that. I was more talking out of sporting perspective and how the overall feeling of this deal is. And thats a huge loss for me personally Bro Lindelof and his wife are up there for the best looking couple in the sport Uh no, no he couldn't. He has that nordic, slightly inbred look despite being Dutch. Yeah mate I said as much.   You asked for a source and there you have one. Up to you what you do with it further. [deleted] Why has this been downvoted? Doesn't €288K literally translate to about £248K, or a crisp 250 for brevity? Jesus christ, it’s not about the fucking conversion, it was about the fucking fact that it’s the fact the salary stays the same + £40k according to capology.   Guehi will get £150k imo. The crisis was mostly caused by a lack of cohesion in the midfield and and an inability to guard the defense adequately. While de ligt may be a great pure defender, he doesn't fit the vision for how our system is meant to function and that makes a player like him a luxury (at his wage) that we don't need. I'll trust the club to figure out how to fix Brazzos mistakes De Ligt is not good enough with the ball on his feet and he's too slow. He was also earning too much money. He is a great defender but he doesn't fit our new play style. Brother didn't watch Haaland getting bossed by martinez in the final. I didn’t say that, I just said city was entertaining the idea of getting Ronaldo. If you'd asked me 18 months ago which club would Vincent Kompany be managing Eric Dier at, Bayern Munich would literally not be in my top 50 guesses Is stanisic any good? I know he’s pretty hyped but I haven’t seen him play more than a match or two Why? De Ligt was playing in the CL semis when at an age when all the other players were still playing at youth level. Since that he's been an integral part in league winning teams except for last season. But go on, judge him based only on last season. I doubt you even watch Bayern aside from the occasional CL match. Then 45-50 million sounds very low.. Even if we leave the amortisation aside, Bayern is gonna save 15m in wages this year and about 8m each in the next two years, if they sign Zah and the rumoured salary is true.  If we then include the secondary gains from a overall decreased and restructured payroll, it most certainly ends up as a pretty sizable net positive.  I don't mean to be rude here and I know, that many o share your sentiments, but more often then not ppl with little understanding of finances are bad at understanding and evaluating deals. Hey, I’m not arguing with you 😂 I saw a post on Lindelof’s Insta a while back of him and his wife doing stuff for UNICEF (he’s an ambassador for them) and my first 2 thoughts were: 1) *damn what an attractive couple* and 2) Oh good for them, it’s great to see footballers getting involved in this sort of thing. What a weird thing to write. Yahoo news is about as credible as a random guy on Reddit It is not. That's also someone simply writing their thoughts on the internet. You must be a very gullible person in life if you think differently, a con-man's dream, i'm sure. What are you blabbering, Bruno is at [160k](https://www.capology.com/club/newcastle/salaries/) + bonus  which is 40k, unless he hits the quota for activating bonus, 160k is the base and Guehi at [50k](https://www.capology.com/player/marc-guehi-36720/)according to capology. I wasn't saying you were saying it, I said ""there's still people"" Eric Dier at Bayern is gonna be one of those ""what the fuck is a polar bear doing in Arlington Texas"" memes  Fair play to him though, he hasn't looked totally out of place at Bayern Eric Dier keeping Upamecano out of the Bayern team is the sort of thing you'd be sent to an asylum for predicting, yet here we are He's pretty good. Slow start at Leverkusen last season but after about January, he was key in a lot of important games. I'd call him a jack-of-all-trades kind of player, in the sense that he's good at a lot of things, but not really world class. He can play across the entire back line, good at build-up play, good at crossing when playing as a fullback, etc. Really handy player to have (which is why it's baffling he left on loan last season) I’ll judge him based on the past two season. Were he hasn’t been one of the best in the world like you are claiming. Not to mention most of the fans want him to stay so this is not a great deal in any way for us Not really. If anything the longer contract works in our favour when both parties want out. They want those wages off the book and a slot for a player they will actually use. >What are you blabbering   Why are you being so touchy lol?   >Bruno is at 160k + bonus which is 40k   I literally said ""+40k"" and you just repeated the same thing saying "" + bonus which is 40k"". Absolutely hilarious.    Guehi will get £150k easily imo. You are free to disagree with it, but I really do not care if me saying this offends you lmao  There was a stretch of a few weeks where he was genuinely their best defender which is why he kept starting every game. He isnt flashy or anything but he was the least shit out of all of them and messed up the least which was what Bayern needed to not completely embarrass themselves lmao  Id imagine/hope KMJ is gonna take over next season considering hes finally had a few weeks of actual rest now but the fact that Upamecano is still there while de Ligt is getting shipped is rough tbh probably a good example of how much the right coach, system, and tactics matter for a player to show his potential. You realise he was in the BuLi Team of the Season (including the Kicker one which is generally more reliable) in 22-23? Just watch when he signs his contract Also what type of headspace they are in. Some players just need a fresh start somewhere. Sure. But still absolutely no reason to get so touchy over this lol. "
"VAR audio of 'misread' Matthijs de Ligt foul in late West Ham penalty - Howard Webb Admits it was an error","2024-11-13T09:49:05+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gq9drd/var_audio_of_misread_matthijs_de_ligt_foul_in/","[No textual content]","2542","moonski","https://v.redd.it/t5c5wxim4n0e1","**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**     *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* The issue is that there is clearly no structure or pattern in communication. Look at rugby and cricket and there is a clear formula for going through these types of decisions. This allows them to make more consistent decisions, and make the decisions more quickly. There is no ambiguity, no refs trying to understand what the other is saying over comms. It’s a joke, the implementation is awful it's like Michael Oliver decided it was a penalty even before the ref was saying ""no no no"" and spent the entire review process convincing himself, and then the ref, that he was correct  Oliver  has no answer when the ref asks if anyone has control over the ball -  instead just keeps repeating ""this is the best angle, we can see the contact, this is the best angle......""  (also topical bonus the ref was David Cootes lol) Michael Oliver needs to be sacked   He’s a fucking joke of an official, he legit dictates results So weird that two players going for the ball and accidentally colliding is so often judged as the fault of the defender. Especially given that the defender seems to be the most careful of the two. I feel that looking at the footage so many times makes you focus more and more just on the contact of their legs, and you start ignoring the other things that happened. Like the handball wasn't even discussed, the fact that Ings made basically no contact with the ball but with his arm.   The only reason why Ings got the pen because he went down (because he is an attacker in the box, and also because at the point when they made contact, he was in an unbalanced position, not like de Ligt). They had the same right going for that ball and they contacted each other by missing it. 50/50 This is what Ten Hag died for I love these vids. We wanted transparency and there you go.  Michael Oliver was on mission there. 100 times said no ball contact yet there was a visible ball contact. Can anyone confirm or deny if there is Knee-to-Knee contact, I dont think I heard them mention it once I love how the AVAR chimes in once with “de ligt makes contact with the ball” and doesn’t repeat it again Sack them all including Webb. PGMOL must be the only organization in the world where even if you suck so badly, there are zero ramifications Why aren't the premier league and their clubs putting a few million together to train some competent referees.  It's pocket change to them, get these clowns out the game. This is a really good example of the process just not being correct. We are told that VAR should interfere only when there's been a Clear and Obvious Error. That requires there referee to make a decision, and the VAR to point out the error in the decision.  We can hear here that Coote simply says ""no, no, no"". At no point does he say *why* he doesn't think it's a foul. He doesn't say ""no contact"" or ""not enough contact"" or ""got the ball"" or anything else. Simply, ""no"". The VAR is then reviewing the contact over and over, finding contact, telling Coote to go to the screen, showing the contact over and over, which eventually convinces Coote to give the foul.  They really need to establish that the process should be clear. I thought this is what they were doing with referee's call, but it's fairly obvious that was more nonsense from PGMOL. What *should* happen, imo, is an incident happens. The referee clearly says ""foul/no foul because of [x]"". The VAR can then review if x is correct. In situations where the referee hasn't seen anything at all, the VAR should be asking ""are you aware of this incident?"" and if the referee says no, then send them to the screen straight away to have them watch it again. Coote says straight away it's a coming together, asks follow up questions, asks for other angles, but Oliver just keeps shutting him down and insisting it's a penalty, until the on field ref wilts and gives it, despite clearly not being satisfied. He even asks if Ings ever had control of the ball and Oliver admits no. That should have been end of conversation, but Oliver just steamrolled him. This is shocking! ""He is moving intot the way of the ball...""  He was in the way of the ball, missed it, and then crashed into de Ligt, who actually had already made contact with the said ball.  Oliver reverse engjneered this pemalty, and that too poorly. Why is VAR telling the Ref there is contact. Let the Ref independently decide what they are seeing.  Worst case it should go like this:  VAR: Here's the clip  REF: I don't see shit.  VAR: I see contact here.  REF: Ok I see it now.  It shoul never be ""HEY LOOK DE LIGT HAS FLY KICKED HIM!!!!"" Let's remind ourselves that it should be a ""clear and obvious error"" to overturn an onfield decision like this.  Ignore the specific incident for a second, and whether or not it should be a penalty. If you have to check multiple camera angles, and the ref sees it 16 times at the screen (and asks if this is the best angle they've got after seeing it 9 times) then it's not ""clear and obvious"". They've said multiple times in the video it wasn't clear and obvious. So how could they interevent? Either they're absolutely incompetent or they can just bend the rules to suit whatever agenda they have from the audio it looks as if there trying to find a penalty to give from the very first second rather than trying to make a correct call The standard and professionalism of English referees is very bad compared to other leading European leagues, and given the amount of resources involved.    No idea how they get these freelance gigs reffing games in the Middle East. The word contact is mentioned so often. Football is a contact sport. That is a bump between two players, nothing more.  What's more important for referees is that they start applying common sense and they punish players who fake injuries trying to trick the ref into a decision.  In United's case, this has happened twice recently. Ings there, gets bumped and goes down screaming in the fetal position, and Maddison a few weeks ago when Bruno brushed his shin with the side of his leg and he went down screaming and rolling. Bruno got the red.  I don't know why refs have to buy it? Why don't they just say; *""Stop taking the piss. That didn't hurt. Yellow card for unsportsmanlike behaviour.""*  The ref knows the player isn't the hurt, the players know he isn't hurt, the fans know the player isn't hurt. Why do we all just accept this? Refs could stamp this out in a couple of months if they wanted to. De Ligt definitely makes contact with the ball, just above and to the right of his knee. The ball changes direction and then hits Ings’ stomach. I don’t know how they couldn’t see that at the time, and even more worryingly how they still can’t see it now. Judging by this situation, once the main ref comes to the screen, communication from VAR should be cut off. He should be communicating to them  what he wants to watch, show me that angle, slow it down etc. but he shouldn't be asking 'if there's contact'.   You have eyes, you're the ref, var doesn't see things you can't so why is he asking them if there's contact? VAR would only give their feedback if there is no uncertainty, otherwise once he needs to come to the screen, it's all up to the match ref to make the decision. You fucking what mate!?  It took 2 and a half minutes to just pretend there was a foul.  What about that conversation makes this 'clear and obvious'?  For a start VAR needs to be done by a team outside of PGMOL. The rules of football aren't complicated. Especially when you can pause and rewind at your leisure. Just get some retired fucking lawyers/judges or law school grads with no job or something. Write a knowledge base where you type in key words and details about the incident and it tells you the relevant laws.  And the fact they all have juvenile nicknames for each other irks me no end.  And BTWs Webb or Webby or Webbzy or whatever it'll no doubt be:     BIT FUCKING LATE NOW INNIT!? ""De Ligt no contact with the ball"". Yes he has you fucker!  You can see the ball bounce off his knee as you say it! Fucking hell. Sack them all  Jesus christ! I still cant understand how they have watched this many times and given a penalty. Just incredible really. Holy shit that is horrendous from VAR. Man was hunting for a penalty call, looking at freeze frame ‘point of contact’ instead of reviewing context (its a contact sport, you will always have a point of contact you muppet), and didn’t follow their own piss take ‘clear and obvious error’ rule. Sack the fucking lot of them you cant fox this kind of incompetence. VAR and English refs are an absolute joke! Every single person involved in this should be in JAIL.  (I'm fine.) And who was the VAR official? Michael Oliver. The guy needs a compilation of all his terrible decisions over the last few seasons, at this point I'm sure some of them are intentional. Seems like a real vindicativate person, except of course when it comes to Man City, who's owners so kindly gave him good money to ref in UAE. Coote says knee to knee contact. Asks if Ings was in control of the ball. Was ignored. Clearly didn’t want to give it but the clowns in the VAR room pressured him into it. The peer pressure from the VAR, I can feel it from here. I feel like I need to give a penalty to somebody now. A bit too late now innit Michael Oliver may as well have been in the stands shouting ""PENALTY REF"" as soon as Ings went down. He'd made his mind up it was a penalty before even looking at the footage from multiple angles. Michael Oliver is adamant that there is no de Ligt contact on the ball, even though anyone with a pair of eyes can see there is. Others on the team don't seem to be convinced, but he dictates the call. He provides ""the best angle"" and declares that there is no contact on it, and he pushes it with such authority as to make Coote and the others bow down. What he says goes, even if what he says is blatantly wrong.  You can go down the rabbit hole and say that if this game had been officiated correctly then a certain Dutchman wouldn't have lost his job. And what happened to Michael Oliver for this decision? He was immediately given the Man City game, and then Arsenal vs Chelsea. ""Oh, think of the refs"". Yeah? Well think of the managers who have their jobs on the line, the clubs that have hundreds of millions, qualifications, relegation survival, titles and trophies at stake. I'm sick of this one-way respect nonsense.  Accountability and meritocracy by arse. They used the lowly Coote as a sacrificial lamb and suspended him, but Michael Oliver, because of his reputation and status at PGMOL, just gets away with whatever the hell he wants. He has a history of making these absolutely brain dead calls that seem to affect certain teams, and I'm not convinced that he is simply just incompetent. If he is, he shouldn't be at this level. If it's something more sinister, it needs to be called out.   I'm a Liverpool supporter, but Man United got robbed that day, and the man responsible is still out there being given big games when he doesn't deserve them. Utter clown show. You can tell the ref in his head is thinking ""Are you taking the piss? You've called me over for this?"" But all he can do is say is ""We've got knee to knee contact.""  The refs in this country is just one big club, where rule #1 is don't go against your pal, we must stick together no matter what, even if we are making ourselves look like a bunch of clueless bellends.  Get PGMOL in the bin, get VAR in the bin, it's goes against what the sport is all about. Football was fine for 150 years without it. So let me get this straight, this is the bullshit that might ruin our historic season? They're still calling each other by nicknames?? For fucks sake I'd have been angry if we conceeded a pen like that. Well, it happened quite a lot so i'm used to. Paraphrasing but 'more contact by de Ligt than Ings'  How the fuck can one person have more contact than another? Kinda feel the refs needs to pay for eth sacking and not us How can they not see that de lift touches the ball? Given clubs can’t/shouldn’t talk about individual refs, I am surprised there hasn’t been more of an angle of - Howard Webb is in charge and clearly giving them awful instructions on interpretation of laws and his position in untenable.   Refs everywhere are awful, but the use of VAR in England is a lottery when they decide to intervene. Christ, these jokers should not be allowed near a pitch ten hag died for this further evidence that VAR works, but the refs don't It’s weeks later now. When did they decide Michael Oliver had fucked up and what did they do about it? Because he refereed games in the subsequent two game weeks, including the high profile Chelsea vs. Arsenal. So what has Howard Webb and PGMOL done to educate/punish Oliver to make it clear to him that he made a major error?  It’s all well and good for Webb to go ‘Oopsie’ the best part of a month later, but what has he actually done behind the scenes to address this? That’s what we need to know. I thought Webb was supposed to be in our pocket FFS ever since he got put in charge we get fucked as much / slightly more than most In my opinion this has failed in three ways:  1. Looks like de ligt actually gets a slight touch on the ball, you can see the ball spin differently as it is bouncing up between him and Ings   2. If we pretend he doesn’t touch the ball, it’s still a complete 50/50 where both players have ran into each other, and if anything it’s hit Ings arms.  3. And even if we discount the other two points, if they have to spend 3 minutes discussing it and reaffirming statements, how is that anything close to clear and obvious?  Gross ineptitude and with it being Oliver I’d say there’s a fair case for it being something even more sinister. They need to make an example of him or these appalling decisions will carry on Until these guys get a clear, concise and comprehensive decision making framework to use, standardised communication and live audio these clusterfucks will continue. it's really not that difficult to improve. The league need to demand these changes. non-negotiable. until they do, they're also to blame. If they're that bothered they should just be able to send the ref to the monitor with no recommendation. Just let him have a look and make his own mind, it would only take 20 seconds. They called that a penalty?  Awful call I'm sure the person responsible for the error will be punished sufficiently to maintain PMGOL's stellar reputation. This is such a dreadful process.    The ref clearly doesn't want to give it, var room with partial observations, then you can feel the pressure to change his mind with the pregnant pause from var.   It's so embarrassing every time they release these videos. It really isn’t a good process A poor man lost his job to this. Even Coote was fucking unsure. Jesus christ these refs need job reviews I would love to hear the VAR conversation everytime. That would make it so much more transparent.    In the Bundesliga i havent heard any of them not even after the game are clips or conversations of the VAR shown. These refs need promotion and demotion too. Costing clubs points and they get away almost every fcking time its time Webb needs to resign. If england doesn’t have the best refs, go start looking outside. The quality is just horrid, and this season is a prime example. Exactly, I feel VAR should be exactly what is means, an assistant referee. Not some Fifa slowmo  camera control bullshit. They should make it so that the ref gets maximum of 1 replay per angle. If he can’t make up his mind by then, its not “clear and obvious” anymore is it? IF IT WERE CLEAR AND OBVIOUS WHY ARE YOU SPENDING TEN MINUTES TRYING TO WORK IT OUT. FOLLOW THE RULES YOU MUG. We need some sort of refereeing league where the best refs get rewarded and promoted for their best decision-making, fewest errors etc. We need a culture of celebrating good refs to promote improved refereeing, and not just shitting on them because there's nowt else going for them. At what point does Howard Webb’s job become untenable? VAR literally pushed pen here, from the start.  Throughout the entire conversation, the on field's tone seemed like he wasn't having it. Then was just like, ""Ok, pen"". At midfield that’s a foul, de Ligt was careless. But at midfield it’s just a free kick.  If it’s a foul at midfield it’s a foul in the box therefore a penalty.  The problem from top to bottom is this intentional cheating by intentionally not following the Laws, instead enforcing ref rules. Idk. I guess Im in minority here but i don’t think this is such a terrible decision everyone make it out to be. De Ligt is clearly kicking Ings and while Ings is pulling his leg and foot back to prevent kicking de ligt, de ligt follows through. I dislike the current use of VAR in PL as much as the next one but think is decision is far from as bad as other examples. De Ligt does make contact with the ball though. They get the fundamentals wrong. These guys are pathetic. Genuinely baffles me why don't the premier league teams just come together and say fuck this, we're making our own body for refs. It's not like they can't looks like a penalty to me, de ligt kicks him, (not the other way around and not both collide with each other) before west ham guy can  control the ball Am I going crazy? How is everyone saying this is anything but a clear penalty? Can someone genuinely point out what I’m missing? A lot of theses miscomunications can be solved by implementing and standardizing a radio telephony procedure. Anyone that worked in the aviation industry can tell you that. PGMOL is too arrogant to understand there is flaws to how they do things. 5 years of VAR and i cant believe this is still the way they communicate. Surely, they should have shown multiple angles even if this one was ""the best"". Give the on field ref as much info as possible VAR is complete incompetence and whatever narrative they have decided on is what the ref will receive. And no I don’t think it’s the prem fixing results or being against United specifically. It’s just whatever the VAR official decides first is what they’ll get the ref to think.  This one the immediate correction of knee to knee to lower leg is to tell the ref he’s kicked him, and other language during the discussion is clear they want him to give a penalty.  Similar situation is the Casemiro red from a previous season where the var reply was the slow motion one angle of him ‘grabbing the players neck’. Normal replays showed it was just argy bargy as you often get but the one angle slowed down made it out as something else and ref had no option but to show a red.  I’m sure other teams have similar examples from their matches where VAR has decided what the outcome is so will just show the supporting evidence to the ref.  In this situation ETH did get sacked so I’m less upset. Took Coote a whole minute to mentally prepare himself in front of the monitor for the certain backslash this BS call will lead to. I get that he doesn't get the ball, but it's a very low bar for giving a penalty, not as if Ings is in a goal scoring position either, although it's clumsy, it's incredibly harsh. Can't see consistency being applied with this, and that's what makes it an even bigger problem than just a wrong call. Shouldn't the whole team be suspended for this? Not just the guy that made the decision And so what will the consequences be?.. every week we see referee or var mistakes and whether it’s Howard Webb, or Dermot Gallagher coming out admitting it was a mistake but yet nothing happens. There’s literally never any punishments or consequences, it’s just ‘oh let’s move onto next week’. Rinse & repeat I dont get the point of having a sort of third umpire and still fking up with this sort of frequency  An incident occurs Ref make a decision It could be wrong Gets reviewed from multiple angles A decision is made  3 days later  Pgmol: the reviewed decision was wrong  Imagine if the third unpire in  cricket got decisions wrong with this frequency It's a coming together that happens all the time, both going for the ball. De Ligt gets a slight touch on it and if they can't see that, they need to review what monitor setup etc they have. I noticed that touch instantly, are they looking at monitors 6 feet away or something?   This whole 'let's not re-referee decisions' then shit like this gets pulled and pushed forward to be a pen. I don't mind them refereeing some decisions if it's the right one but don't release these 'directives' that clearly aren't followed then.   This summer was the one for VAR to be overhauled and work on automatic offsides etc, PGMOL have buried their head in the sand and the abuse/paranoid towards refs will only get worse when the process and failures are so bad. Refs shouldn't get abused but likewise it's a massive test of patience when the system is such a shit show. This did seem like Michael Oliver was pushing for a pen too. ""If refs came out and explained decisions then the general public would understand""   The general public when refs explain decisions  We desperately need to scrap this shit, football has become a joke He’s clearly trying to influence the actual Ref. Funny how in Italy this is 100% penalty, even for the audience. Michael Oliver is criminal, he decides it's a pen and won't take no for an answer. The idea that the VAR needs to be another full-time on field referee is genuinely insane. You take someone who has trained their entire life for a certain job and moved up the ranks, they get all the way to the top level and then finally they get shoehorned into a dark little room and asked to be elite at that job too. In my opinion there is almost no overlap between what makes a good referee and what makes a good var aside from knowledge of the laws. It’s simply arrogance because every other pro sport has already learned this lesson but fifa and ifab think their sport is special Do these VAR decisions need to go to a 2/3 approval process jfc how is it this bad lmfao “Yeah we’ve got knee to knee contact, knee from De Ligt onto Danny Ings” eh? How can knee to knee be in favor of anyone if it’s 50/50?! Ooo, we had a similar VAR fuck up in the Swiss League weekend before last! FC Luzern vs. Grasshopper Club Zürich in the 13th round.  So, within a span of like three minutes Luzern are awarded two penalties for handball. While the first one is an issue with the handball rule (defender has his arm out for stability and balance and gets the ball shot at his arm from short distance), it's the second one that fanned the flames against VAR in Switzerland.   Luzern's attacker's shot is seemingly deflected slightly by Grasshopper's defender and the ref gives a corner. However, the corner doesn't happen and soon after the ref goes to look at the monitor. Ref is only shown one angle, where the defender's arm is blurred in multiple frames due to movement. you'd think it's not conclusive, so on-field decision should stand, right? nope, ref calls penalty! where the first penalty was saved, the second one is securely buried in the net and Luzern go up 2-0  on TV, we're shortly after shown a second angle where no contact between the ball and the defender's arm can be seen. the deflection's source cannot be completely determined either, but looks to be either the thigh or stomach area. after the match, the ref says in an interview that he was unable to see the hand contact on the screen ""bc the screen is not so good as what we have at home"". he decided to award a penalty, bc the VAR told him that he had seen the contact and had also seen a better angle where the contact is clearly visible. this better angle is never made public, as it doesn't exist, which the Swiss referee boss later admitted.  oh, and our coach was fired two days later and after losing the game last weekend we're now in last place. Where is the ‘refs call’ they have been mentioning? To me there is absolutely ZERO effort here to stay with the refs decision and I can’t believe they only show the ref one angle on the replay!  It’s also funny that they fail at another objective of theirs, doing things quickly and making sure that there is enough evidence to overturn the refs on field decision. 2 minutes it takes them to arrive at the wrong decision, having to jump through hoops in order to go against the refs decision. It’s madness Looks like De Ligt makes contact with the ball right? The refs are getting Waaay too big for their boots trying to manage the 'entertainment' of games and not just applying the rules.  Speaking, what does constitute a foul? AFAIK The West Ham player needs to be in control of the ball, but that contradicts off the ball fouling, and De Ligt does kick the player, even though it's accidental, and I've seen that given as a penalty before. They need to do a big re-write of the rules because the ref's clearly can't figure it out either. Webb’s logic makes no sense, he’s inventing some concept of fairness based on where the ball is rather than whether a foul occurred in the penalty area.  By his logic a defender away from the play in the penalty area can just haul off and punch someone and the ref shouldn’t give a penalty because it wasn’t a scoring opportunity. Anyone who thinks that is a penalty needs a brain implant cos they clearly haven’t got one to begin with….. but it’s against utd so I’ll allow it 🤣🤣🤣 Good process amirite? Just like David Coote, nemesis will catch up with Michael Oliver soon The FA and PGMOL need to hire someone from the military and train these fucking morons how to talk on a radio.  Absolute crime of communication skills. Enjoy seeing United fucked over, but that was a ridiculously soft penalty. Not every tiny contact is a foul/penalty When you have fanbases form across the entire league agreeing on something (just how terrible PGMOL and VAR), you know something’s up.   The communication is absolutely abysmal and what really makes me angry is that seemingly nothing has changed from the Diaz offsides-waitnotoffsideswecantdof*ckall fiasco It's like they wanted a head line... They only show him 1 angle? One guy saying it’s the best angle I think the ref should look at a few no matter what Stone wall penalty They are so bad at their jobs wow VAR should in the first instance ask what the referee has seen if what he says is wildly different then intervene to send him to the screen with a better angle.   Say nothing other than these are the angles and let them make up their own mind. Referee whom doesn’t know that football is a contact sport. Ridiculous! Peter Walton wasn't wrong when he said Coote was one of the better ones, its a steaming pile of shit of a selection but he is one of the better ones Bit late for this. ""This is the best angle we have.""  Uh, not really. The other angle from the goal post is worthy of looking at too. It's criminal to not share it. official now on ETH hit list !flair :FC\_Barcelona: ""De Ligt my balls, capitan"" oh wow... he needs to be sacked I remember when Oliver was pretty widely regarded to be our best referee. What happened Cootey dared to stand up to them and they took him down! corruption Surely ETH should be allowed to sue them? This essentially cost him his job. Maybe it fast forwarded the decision but still. Thats it. Get Ten Hag back!!! Coote is gone, now do Oliver!  Neither of the players is on the ball. They are knee too knee, and then there is a handball. That penalty was a joke. You can hear the ref does not really think its a penalty VAR refs checking their FPL first and influence the Ref on the decision. Smart. he never apologies, does he? Honestly I dunno why there isn't a section in the FA's rules for Law 12 - fouls and misconduct referring to 50/50 challenges when neither player is in control of the ball.  https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-12---fouls-and-misconduct  As soon as they have made the decision (however wrong) that De Ligt has 'more contact' and it was 'lower leg', aka a kick, they have to give the penalty, but it doesn't feel right.  By the rules of the game, Ings not being in control of the ball appears to be irrelevant at the moment as far I can can tell?  They should just have a clear checklist of things to check in the VAR room and go through them to make a clear decision that can be understood by all. This ""that looks like a penalty"", ""I feel that is a penalty"" bs needs to be thrown in the bin. Literally see Killman kick out and make contact with both of them. And Ings creates the contact Time and time again we see what the issue is and it's never addressed...  The on field team makes the decision together then the ref has to go over the VAR screen and be told by another team he's wrong... he's in no position to ever disagree with the VAR because he's being told by a team he's wrong and the team he made the call with isn't there to support him in making the correct call Walao if not for this ten hag would still be manager Exactly the quality of outcome i’d expect after a coote and oliver conversation. I genuinely am losing interest in the sport rapidly. So many atrocious decisions recently it genuinely feels rigged. Well, well, isn't this a monumental fuck-up? Can someone kindly explain why this isn't a penalty? I've been watching and playing football for 15 years and I just can't understand this one... De Ligt goes through him but I guess since Ings never had control of the ball it's not a pen???  Is it just a coming together? I agree this isn’t a penalty, but I admit it took me reading the comments to notice that De Ligt does in fact touch the ball first.   Without that contact I think I’d agree with the call. De Ligt goes past the ball to contact Ings, where to me Ings is pulling up to block, not play through.   If you go to block and the defender misses the ball and cleans you up that’s a foul. It’s just that De Ligt DIDN’T miss the ball. I still think this was a pen Wait I am OOTL on this, are people saying it shouldn't have been a penalty? Next do [this disallowed goal for Southampton against Wolves](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gncb0t/ryan_manning_southampton_disallowed_goal_foul/) (and the [second Wolves goal](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gndi2k/wolves_2_0_southampton_matheus_cunha_51/)). Something really shifty went on in that game but because they're two relegation candidates they don't get the same attention. ""I think it's a penalty"" right away   perfectly describes the var situation and the clowns running it It's absolutely hilarious how DRS in Cricket in third world countries is far more structured and detailed and also broadcasted live compared to the fucking Premier League that has a far higher budget I am sorry guys but I think its a fair pen shout. De ligt misses the ball and kicks him which brings the west ham guy to fly Ten Hag got sacked because of this goal De Ligt staying on his feet and Ings falling to the floor makes this look so much worse slowed down, so I can see how its given. You'd expect refs to appreciate that though Thats a CLEAR penalty for me! Ings‘ leg is in the air because he sees De Ligt kicking. And De Ligt is not kicking the ball at all but kicks Ings down. Only issue is, that there is no „knee to knee contact“ i'm surprised they use player and team names in these discussions. It seems like color and number might be more ""neutral"" The PGMOL are incompetent AND corrupt, which is why they are the headlines every single week.   I look forward to champs league games now as you know the refs will officiate decently most of the time. Clear pen. Well done referees.  It is funny people are complaining about refs, while La Liga's president himself admitted he's a Real Madrid fan and the robbery against Lewa goal last week. This should be played out on the broadcast feed live, it should not take two weeks to understand that this decision was made because the referees made something up. It was a clear penalty [deleted] I'm just done with this bullshit.  Football is not a black and white game.  You're going to get incidents that are borderline one way or the other.  You're going to get good luck and bad luck.  Decisions that go your way and ones that don't.  The blurry lines, the fine margins, the grievances and liberties, it's what makes the game interesting.  Sure, if there's something the ref didn't see, that he really needs to have seen, bring him over.  Sure, if there's an obvious offside that was missed, call it afterwards.  Or if there's dangerous behaviour that got missed in the rush.  I don't think I've seen VAR intervention used for something that was actually OBVIOUSLY a mistake, for ages.  If at all.  All of this reviewing and chaotic decision making.  It's killing the game.  You can't celebrate a goal anymore lest it get disallowed. Looks like a penalty to me. What am I missing? Unpopular opinion> This is worth a pen.   Given his viral video this week it could be argued that Coote didn't want to award a pen which might hurt the arch-enemies of a team he hates. So he refused it on field and tried to argue against it with VAR but it was so obviously pen he couldn't. Am I mad. I don’t see the controversy with this one. Looks like he takes his leg out to me Nah, we're cool with it. Thank you Coote Am I mental for thinking that this is a penalty? You should upload or link the full video: https://www.skysports.com/football/video/16426/13253165/howard-webb-admits-var-misread-matthijs-de-ligt-foul-in-late-west-ham-penalty  God, it is absolutely insufferable to hear every bad United decision admitted as a mistake whilst we get gaslit with, it's the letter of the law or it's a clear and obvious error. Also, if the on-field ref is the one making the decision, he should be given all the angles, and allowed to arrive at a conclusion.   Here, Oliver has decided :  -This is something that needs to reviewed -This is the best angle -Ings is moving into the way of the ball -de Ligt made no contact with the ball -There's knee to knee contact  and wants Coote to to make a decision based on those points. WTF. Why even show him the footage at that point! What the fuck is this process! The fact these cunts implemented VAR without looking at rugby for influence is hilarious. Literally all football had to do was be like rugby and we'd have the tech in a much better way right now.  But no, the cunts in charge are too insecure and fragile to let their power go. So we have to genuinely watch a middle aged bloke walk over to a fucking screen as if people with dozens of cameras aren't allowed to make a decision in the moment. Theres the frustrating part, rugby officials make mistakes or disputed decisions too but at least whenever the officials interact there's a clear protocol and process.    Pgmol had other high performance sports to learn from. Not to mention military, emergency services, any number of industries where high pressure decisions need to be made in a short time in the basis of clear conversation.     Instead it sounds like they based their process in Richard Keys and Andy Gray half time analysis That's basically because other sports don't treat their referees like some omniscient near-infallible demigod who must never be contradicted, merely invited to look at it again. In other sports, the on-field referee *defers* to the video ref, they ask the video ref (who has all the angles) to take the decision. Watch a Rugby League match to see it in action (including the last bit, where they watch it again at normal speed). Watch a review in cricket. The on-field refs and umpires are (gasp) *willing to admit they might be wrong*.  That could never happen while the current referee culture holds sway in football. I genuinely don't understand why they haven't just gone 'this is how rugby does it, we're going to copy these procedures wholesale into football'. Everything from cracking down on abuse towards refs to the communication between refs is better in rugby, yet footballing authorities seem totally reluctant to actually do this. It must just be pride at some point, a total unwillingness to admit that other sports do it better and that they can learn from them. The obvious solution is a straight vote between the 3 refs, with a) everyone making it clear their reasoning and b) disagreements completely acceptable and allowed.  We are still in this mentality of protecting the on-pitch ref, and not refs generally being seen to disagree. Pre VAR, other refs were just protecting the on pitch ref and their fallible decisions. But the whole point of VAR is to correct those decisions.   Why should the refs pretend they agree on marginal calls. Disagreement is healthy. If this came down to a 3 ref vote, it probably would have gone the other way with Cootes and the assistant VAR going against Oliver. totally agree. var discussed the whole thing without ever taking into consideration if ings had control of the ball, a thing the ref instantly points out. that's strike number one on structures being non-existent.  then i see the people in the comments here bringing up normal collisions that happen on the pitch, which is totally valid and i personally wasn't thinking about it at all. var and ref also didn't seem to be judging that aspect of the play, so that's strike number 2.  it's so crazy that they've been doing this for so long and haven't arrived at a clear, i don't know, 5-step consideration to walk them through every kind of play. it can't be that fucking hard and they're making it so incredibly stressful and difficult for themselves it's insane I don't get it at all, really. We use comms for freaking high school matches here (we typically can't use them in USSF/club soccer as every official has to be regional or higher to use them), and before every match we have a quick 2-3 minute discussion covering the do's and don't's of communication. We use specific language to avoid confusion, like using only confirmation language instead of negative language - i.e. 'green throw' instead of 'came off red', or 'all good' instead of 'no foul'. We don't say 'no offside' because the referee may only hear 'offside'. Simple stuff.  You'd think that communication issues would be avoided entirely at this level, particularly after that incident in the Tottenham match around the confusing language of confirmed call vs. the actual call on the field. Just dumb. The clearest example of the above is the Diaz goal that got chalked off for us against Spurs. A lot of mumbling jumbling rather than just saying that the goal has been ruled as an 'offside' but it isn't one and it now stands as a goal.  'Good process lads' And this is actually the improved - post-Liverpool-Spurs-fuck-up - version of ""communication"". Previously it was all ""Hurr Hurr matey thats yer pen I tell ya..."" or whatever the way drunk lads chat inside a pub. > PGMOL must be the only organization in the world where even if you suck so badly, there are zero ramifications  Hahahahahhahahahahhahaa I like that rugby has the on-field decision stand if there are no mitigating factors; this removes the frustration with VAR as 50-50 decisions. Allow the ref to use his instinct and not some guy trying to figure out for 5 minutes if there was enough contact one week versus the following week making the opposite decision because of the backlash. They've supposedly had air traffic controllers help them with the VAR setup but I don't think it's helped too much. The air traffic controllers should be the best in the world at this type of behind the scenes communication but maybe they aren't that great at teaching We hear everything, the ref on the field doesn't. Spot on. I was in the military and there is distinct language used in certain patterns to ensure there is absolute clarity in what is being said. Fully agree, it's something I've been banging on about for ages. Regularise the language and the steps they go through. VAR always seems to be in such a huge rush and jumping all over the place which is definitely making things more confused.   At least this doesn't have any of the usual ""mate"" and whatever PE teach-esque nicknames they often use. That was truly embarrassing. Hopefully something like the ATC is adopted.          It was refined over time. Because they learnt from their mistakes and decided to take action.     Unlike these ""professionals"" who have their heads buried deep Yet PGMOL told everybody they'd have better communication after disallowing a genuine goal last season, so there's no reason why it shouldn't now be structured correctly and - most importantly - consistently.   PGMOL don't give a fuck. Webb has effectively just said ""we made an error"" over and over again since he took over as head of PGMOL, and nothing is done about it. If I made this many errors in work, I'd have been sacked long ago. A PL referee? Two weeks in a lower division, and then they're back to it, once everybody has calmed down and forgotten about it all. > The issue is that there is clearly no structure or pattern in communication.  They need to put an aviator in charge of VAR. The only way it gets fixed is by removing Webb and having someone with an actual clue come in.  Fans need to start demanding it Football is a bit fast paced. It all narrows down to the appeal. If the team appeal do the referee stop the game to review or continue it? How difficult is it to ask the on field ref ""What do you think?"". The on field ref then would just say both clashed into each other, no penalty, and move on.  So infuriating how something so simple needs to be made so needlessly complicated. You can tell Coote isn’t convinced at all either and he’s trying to find a way to justify it even to himself.  Really can’t see why once he gets to the screen they can’t enter an actual dialogue, rather than Oliver basically saying “Look!  You have to give it!”.    It’s incredibly strange that virtually every time a ref goes to the monitor, the on-field decision is going to be overruled. Cootes doesn’t want to give that even after watching the replay. They must have meetings where they’ve agreed they’ll only call refs over if they’re def wrong, so the act of going to the monitor is making refs think twice. It doesn’t make sense why he doesn’t just say, ‘not convinced there’s anything in that, I’m sticking with on field call’. That's because Michael Oliver is a biased cunt -""Does Ings have control of the ball at any point?"" -""He does not""  Don't know what you're hearing They shouldnt be biasing the referee at all when they call him to the monitor. I don't think the David Coote video is as damning as people are making it out to be.  He said that Klopp was annoying to officiate.  And that article posted about each of the games Coote reffed for Liverpool didn't show any bias against Liverpool.    You can not like your coworkers or customers and still do a good job...... Also Coote's responsibility to stand up for his own decision.  But of course he doesn't because he's spineless.  He's even looking at it right there on the monitor so there's no excuse.  Oliver also just getting involved when he really doesn't have to.  Shocking. It’s like VAR is trying to stitch the refs up half the time. Same with the pen we got mid week. Was never a pen but they cherry picked the footage to make it seem that way.  The VAR should not be able to talk to the ref about an incident, they should decide if they think it’s the wrong decision, show the ref all the footage and only answer direct questions. Where does this audio come from? It'd be awesome if all of these controversial decisions were always made public. Transparency imo should help keep the game healthy. 5 seconds of review is all he needed to push for a penalty! Thats either incompetence or straight up corruption. Completely agreed. The fact that he's somehow the face of the PGMOL as their ""best"" referee, getting all the biggest games, is genuinely laughable. And that's not even mentioning his dodgy connections to the City Football Group etc. The man cost Ten Hag his job 🤬 Really don't know what happened because pre-lockdown he was comfortably the best ref in the country I still can’t understand how anyone with an objective opinion could say this is a penalty. I just had to laugh at the whole situation as it unfolded on TV. How can England’s ""best"" referee actually believe this is a penalty? Oliver should be suspended for this serious mistake. He basically determined the outcome of the last City-Liverpool match when he decided not to whistle for a penalty on Doku.  Probably had nothing to do with his side hustle getting paid by City's ownership to ref games in the UAE. ‘De Ligt no contact on the ball’ which he clearly does, it bounces off his shin and 0 mention that Ings makes no contact of the ball  Its a 50/50 collision   These criminals man, literally ruin the sport Except when it’s an aerial duel, then it’s somehow always the attacker’s fault. It's a symptom of the stupid rule that you cannot clear a ball anymore.  The striker has no right to CHASE a ball and expect to not be kicked.  He's putting himself in danger. It's not the defender or keeper hoofing it away responsibility to make sure they don't leave their leg out or studs up. Yeah Ings is just coming in really fast, basically no way he could've get the ball through the 2-3 defenders ahead of him. He tried to touch the ball first and then he knew exactly there's gonna be contact on the follow up I'm a Liverpool supporter, West Ham season ticket holder and a hater of Man U, but this is 100% not a pen. Something of note, the AVAR says ""Utd are attacking"" , the only person who would refer to West Ham as Utd, in a game against Man U, is a West Ham supporter, 100%. Inter fans are still crying about the Iuliano-Ronaldo incident 26 year later... We had the opposite at Wolves at the weekend. Usually the slower moving of the two as well. I’m a bit lost - is everybody ignoring the fact that De Ligt kicked Ings’ foot? Yeah, there are so many ""fouls"" like this where it seems completely arbitrary which player has made the offense.  Luckily they aren't always called but I think too often they are.  The Trossard on Kulusveksi penalty claim comes to mind.  Trossard is running in a straight line, Kulusveksi runs in front of him to receive a 1-2 and people were claiming Trossard fouled Kulu - but Kulu is the one who cuts in front and both players are just running. Happens all the time, we're seeing decisions in slow motion far too often which often paints a completely different picture than what happened. You see it a lot for attackers going down in the box, in slow motion some instances look like dives or easy falls but in real time the speed they're going it's obvious a shove or block has an impact. yeah, var really changed football in that regard. This is one of the situations that the more often you look at it the more it looks like a foul, whereas in real time you would quite clearly argue that this is just not enough for a foul. it sucks. Interestingly not a lot of discussion around what appears to be Kilman sticking a keg out also impacting Ings here. Looks like Ings also seeing Kilman poke at the ball may lead to him pulling his own leg back and missing it himself, further exacerbating the contact. Even on replay.   No idea how this is determined objectively a penalty by multiple professionals examining every available angle. It's just disappointing. There needs to be a checklist for these kind of decisions really, similar to pilots having emergency checklists. You go step by step accessing the situation using clear and simple criteria and they lead you to an outcome. Here, if its a 50/50 challenge, neither player controls the ball and the contact isn't overly reckless from either player so there's nothing to give either way. There's still some subjectivity in that but at least you're covering off what isn't subjective whereas here it was totally ignored. Instead you have these VAR refs letting confirmation bias guide their decision making based on the worst possible angle of the challenge or contact, its bound to lead to penalty decisions being favoured. Yeah, watching this I was increasingly feeling like it was a pen. Credit to Coote because he comes over and asks the key question of whether or not Ings was actually in possession. It is then immediately clear he didn't and this is a 50/50 where neither get the ball and both hit each other. He should have stuck to his guns ETH had been going negative GD for 1.3 seasons.   He would most likely have been fired in a few weeks anyway. I'm sure he has enough of the golden parachute to cushion his fall I figure he would've been sacked for a draw as well. I love them too. They should be broadcasted live to people on TV as an option.  I would love to watch a whole game where you can just hear the refs call.   There's an Aussie game that did it and it's really interesting.  https://youtu.be/UR9wwqjbO1I All I know is this is the best angle All I’m seeing is lower leg contact ""OK"" At least this shows the dangers of a monopoly lol >PGMOL must be the only organization in the world where even if you suck so badly, there are zero ramifications  I’ve got some bad news for you >PGMOL must be the only organization in the world where even if you suck so badly, there are zero ramifications  If you have worked anywhere, you will know that there are people who suck at their job everywhere and never see any consequences for it. I am constantly blown away by the incompetence of those in leadership positions who genuinely do not have a clue, but seem get a free pass.  This exact attitude is why we are in this position in the first place. It's also one of the only jobs in the world where you are berated by tens of thousands of people every time you work, and then have to come home to thousands more online calling for your head after every big decision you make. Then we wonder why we have such a hard time convincing people to become referees and have such a small talent pool to select from.  I agree that PGMOL needs reform, but sacking the only people we have does not seem like the best idea. Who do you propose to replace them with? The manager lost his job because of this call, why shouldn’t the referee Well they do they get reviewed all the time, they just don't always agree with peoples gut reaction of sacking them all. > PGMOL must be the only organization in the world where even if you suck so badly, there are zero ramifications  Tell that to r/NFL r/NBA r/formula1 etc etc lol Ever heard of the police? Extra pay would help but you'll always have the problem that it's a thankless job. No one likes refs, in fact they are hated, and in extreme cases you have certain managers who rile their fans up into threatening their families (Mourinho comes to mind but he's not the only one.) Would you ever want to be a ref? Cause I would not, at lower levels you have very little protection from the fact that you anger both teams every week, and even if you are good/lucky enough to get to higher levels, yes the pay isn't bad but you basically become a worldwide villain. Y’all would still complain The on field ref's error was so clear and obvious that it took them over five minutes to decide if it was a clear and obvious error, before inviting the on field ref to decide for himself if it was a clear and obvious error. It's so ridiculous that they still haven't established a clear process. Below an eredivisie VAR interaction from 4 years ago. How the PL still does not have this is insane, Oliver should be suspended until he gets it right.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVc4-Bk8hkg&list=PLLvcn3TtK-zm9v_5kO7LD6nWHlNa-XIS3&index=3&ab_channel=K.N.V.B.  It's obviouisly all in Dutch but referee upon seeing the foul in real time says ""contact to the face but I'm not sure if it was intentional"". VAR checks, sees that the attacker got the ball first and the goalkeeper hits attackers face after, not an unintenional coming together. VAR communicates to pause play and recommend the referee to the screen because they believe it is a penalty. Referee goes to the screen, is not interrupted, asks for different angles while VAR shuts up so the referee can make his own decision. You can’t have the referee clearly explain why he has not made a call because play is still going in that case. It’s absurd to expect the on field ref to explain every call he does not make because then he wouldn’t have time to ref.  You can’t “good process” your way to humans making the right decision. The process here is fine, the issue is that the VAR makes a horrific call and the on field Ref backs up that horrible call after watching it on the monitor. No amount of process will fix that. Yep that's what so frustrating with the whole system. PGMOL seem to have made a pigs ear of introducing and running it and just do not seem fit for purpose in many ways.   Yet there's now a small cottage industry in football coverage who see their role as 'defending the refs' and shutting down any criticism and are glorified spin doctors - Dale Johnson, Peter Walton, Mike Dean, Dermot Gallagher, the Mic'd Up show and frankly the likes of Gary Neville. So any chance of a nuanced discussion about laws, VAR and refereeing goes out the window. And yet regardless Oliver will continue to get big games time after time maybe with a token week in League 1 or League 2 if he massively screws up.  And there'll be no explanation of what he's doing/PGMOL are doing to try to improve his performance, how he's being assessed, why his performance has been deemed to being back to PL standard. Or even looking at the broader picture - how PGMOL are trying to approve the VAR process.  It's so opaque.  PGMOL is a proper old boys club, very opaque and happy to close ranks when they need to but god help if anybody dare criticise them in any way. Meanwhile here's 10 articles on how X manager deserves the sack. The entire process is a mess. We saw it last year with the disallowed Diaz goal. These guys don't even have confirmations down. You look at sports like F1 for instance. Race engineers and drivers have developed phrases to make everything clear and prevent any confusion. They will repeat things to make sure that there is no confusion such as saying ""box, box"". Here it feels like they just wing it and hope for the best. How hard is it to create a procedure like what you described? How hard is it to create clearly defined phrases that prevent confusion? Every time we get audio from VAR, it sounds like a discord call. The worst thing is they repeatedly said it was ""knee-to-knee"" which was all it was. A pretty innocuous 50-50 challenge where neither player really had control of the ball. Cos they're trying to be quick so they tell him what to look for. >VAR: Here's the clip  >REF: I don't see shit.  >VAR: I see contact here.  >REF: Ok I see it now.  Actually it should have gone:  VAR: Here's the clip  REF: I don't see shit.  VAR: I see contact here.  REF: You're full of shit. Play on.    Or better still:     VAR: It's not a clear and obvious error therefore we will not do anything. Spot on. Finding reasons to give, rather than analysing Help 115 charges fc from time to time and the paycheck is secured Watch a Spanish game Its not even a standard  It is exactly what it is, cheating.  We’ve called this sport corrupt for years now and it is becoming blatantly obvious Not really. Every country thinks their refs are utter shit. In Germany many people believe that the quality of the on field refereeing decreased since introduction of the var. It was a bit clearer on that other angle they dismissed quite quickly. Bit concerning in general that they're so comfortable relying on one angle as its easy to see things in one angle that become more apparently incorrect from another angle. for real, how blind can you be????? > Asks if Ings was in control of the ball. Was ignored.  How was he ignored?  > Coote: ...but does Ings have control of the ball at any point?  > VAR: He does not, he's moving into the way of the ball and De Ligt comes into the contact with Ings PGMOL should be in the bin. But VAR is the best thing FIFA implement recently and it works very well (not perfect) in international competitions. WC, Euro all have better VAR implement than what EPL is doing. Right so if a ref isn't call to VAR it's to protect his mate.  If he is called over then he needs to protect his mate, who has just failed to protect him.  People came up with this silly idea and now try to make everything fit with it. No, he was getting sacked either way as they had been terrible. The pen you lot didn't get against us was just as ridiculous. Yeah it's not like this is breaking news. VAR has been inconsistent since it's very debut. West ham got a cheap penalty and we lost because of it. If you ask me we should never have been in a position where than Penalty goal cost us the game to begin with.  But at the end of the day ETH lost his job as a result so who is the real loser here? Im not in any way defending this specific decision, but the point they are trying to make is obviously which player has more «fault» regarding the contact. If one player is standing still and another player kicks the shit out of him from behind, the amount of contact is of course equal for both of them. But one is obviously causing the contact and responsible for the foul. I assume thats what they are getting at here. >De Ligt is clearly kicking Ings and while Ings is pulling his leg and foot back to prevent kicking de ligt  Found Michael Oliver’s Reddit I agree. For me it's a pen. Defender goes through attacker in the box. How are people so worked up that this was given?  De ligt’s contact with the ball is absolutely minimal, he has no idea about it and he gets way more of the man  “Ings wasn’t in control of the ball” so what, de ligt wasn’t either? I’d still say West Ham were in possession. But let’s say they weren’t for arguments sake, in which case the ball is in nobody’s possession. The defender still goes through the attacker in the box? I thought the outrageous end of this video would have to be that there's no penalty. Also looked quite clear to me I also agree, some of the people talking about a handball confuse me- it hit Ings on the arm because the force De Ligt clatters into him?  Unless I’m missing something I think it’s a penalty What fantasy world are you living in. Arteta got punished by the federation, ridiculed by other clubs, managers, and fans for criticizing blatant ref fuckups.   The truth is other clubs and their fans only acknowledges the poor level of refereeing once they are the victim of huge mistakes. I guess Arsenal were just ahead of everyone else in being fucked by the refs and speaking up about it You're watching a slow mo replay over and over of the point of contact, the same thing the moronic VARs are doing. In real time Danny Ings was almost falling over anyway and fell into a near-stationary De Ligt. It was a textbook 50/50 contest. De Ligt even got ball contact which all VARs missed. This isn't a miscommunication. there is no PGMOL agenda to ensure directionless west ham beating the biggest club in the land on a random october afternoon i can say that when i started watching the clip i agreed with you. but there's a lot to unpack here. i was totally influenced by the way they were discussing the play. they never considered the fact that collisions happen in a contact sport, a lot of normal contact looks like a foul at first glance.  also, we are spectators, not professional refs. you and i might disagree, see things differently, and that's fine, but refs should work by a set of rules and work within that to make the best decision possible. they're responsible for creating those processes and structures needed to watch replays and make informed, accurate, and efficient decisions. the problem is, these dumb fucks have been doing this for what, 5 years now, and still haven't created any practical guidelines, so they're discussing things without guardrails, they have little time to make considerations, so it's all rushed and awful. it's no surprise the decisions are so bad.  in this clip alone: the var team quickly narrows down to whatever they think is most important while scrambling to find the best angles. then the on-field ref comes along and instantly asks them about something they haven't considered at all, so they all sound stumped and unsure. ref already had made up his mind and hearing no clear objection from the team, went forward with his original decision. var added nothing to this process.  to make things worse, the clip gets posted on reddit and you can see how many people see different things from the play, all of which should be considered by the refs. but since they have no plan, no method, no nothing, they're forced into rushed decisions and their considerations are full of gaps It's driving me crazy. Wrong call, okay, but surely this isn't that heinous of a decision? They've admitted it was a mistake and the on-field decision should have stood (no penalty) Tbh, Semedo probably is fouled, even though he goes down easily. The way I look at it is that Manning doesn't get the ball if not for the contract on Semedo.  The second Wolves goal, well, it should've been disallowed for at least one, if not two, fouls. What I'll say, however, is that quite often when teams ask for something to be pulled back for a foul, the red looks at it and says not enough contact or different phase of play. In this circumstance, there's two fouls and it's the same phase of play. If this contact happened in the box, it would've been disallowed based on precedent we've seen. Good thing you're sorry then. Offer rivals the option of restoring Ten Hag + 1 point back to United versus Amorim and I think I know what they’re choosing De Ligt makes contact with the ball before the man (and there's obviously no excessive force here). Do you think we are jumping up and down with joy right now? What good does it do for us? You are making it sound as if this is some kind of favoritism, while I'd rather have the points and better refereeing than these meaningless admissions. That's right.  You get in there and make this conversation about you! you guys have gotten dicked over a bunch too but we absolutely do not get every bad decision against us admitted as a mistake lol wtf The amount of drama you guy try to create is hilarious, gaslit lol.  Rice wasn't the letter of the law, it was Rice being an idiot, you're literally trying to argue over correct decisions in comparison to an actual error. And Coote kept asking if that is the best angle they have lmao just to be told ""yes"" everytime. A fucking circus Yeah. Like I have no problem with Oliver deciding it should be reviewed BUT as soon as Coote is at the screen, Oliver should shut up and let the RO run through the footage at a few angles to see what Coote decides.  Oliver convincing Coote it’s a penalty takes the decision away from Coote, and the whole point of having VAR is that refs can have a second look is they’re advised to.  As you say, Coote may as well have not seen the footage at that point. Is like he playing a game of convince Coote, when he could allow to see all the angles >if the on-field ref is the one making the decision, he should be given all the angles, and allowed to arrive at a conclusion.  I have no clue why the on field ref has to do anything. He has the ear piece and on the other side is a team with 10 monitors. He should be just regurgitating what they say. So bizarre The Refs don't want VAR, they've gone out of there way to make it controversial when it's the humans behind the scenes that are causing all of the problems.   VAR is a tool, if you miss a nail with a hammer and hit your thumb, blaming the hammer just means you're more likely to do it again. To note; rugby isn’t perfect here either. The key thing is it’s at least more consistent and the errors are in judgement not communication when they happen. Or any other sport for influence. I know a guy who works in replay in another sport that’s using replay more effectively, and they’ve met with the VAR leadership to share ideas. Those meetings are so one-sided where it’s just VAR bragging about their tech and how cutting edge they are. They seem arrogant Not just rugby, literally every other professional sport that does this, does it better. The nfl has been doing this for 40 years. The state of VAR at the moment is simply down to arrogance from fifa, ifab, the fa, pgmol, everybody else involved >""World Rugby spell out in their laws that “the referee should not be subservient to the system” and that he is “the decision-maker and must remain in charge of the game”.  >https://www.rugbyworld.com/tournaments/rugby-six-nations/tmo-television-match-official-explained-88934  Not into rugby myself but a quick google says the people with dozens of cameras aren't allowed to make the decision. Same as with var in football > In other sports, the on-field referee defers to the video ref, they ask the video ref (who has all the angles) to take the decision.   quick google of rugby league Television Match Official (TMO) Protocol.   the first rule listed:  >The referee remains the lead decision-maker of the refereeing team. The intention of the protocol is to provide the referee, their assistant referees and the TMO (commonly referred to as the Team of 4) with a technology-based solution to collectively make better and more accurate decisions. The protocol is not intended for the referee to absolve themselves of their decision-making duties and obligations. They have supposedly brought in Air Traffic controllers to help them with this specific issue but I'm not sure it's paid off Agreed. I’d also be in favor of a time limit. If you can’t make the call in 30s it’s probably not clear and obvious In this situation I’d see it something like this: VAR: Checking Penalty, Play on Ref: OK VAR: Contact in box - Check Defender makes no contact with ball - Check Attacker in control of ball - Negative Dangerous play - Negative  No clear and obvious error - play on  (Disclaimer: I’m a United fan) Check a DRS review in cricket or TMO call in rugby to see how it should be done I actually thought this is the standard procedure. To have communication with the ref on what his perception of the situation was and whether the footage indicates that his perception is clearly wrong.  Quite concerning that this is not the case. Howard Webb was asked on the Overlap by Ian Wright how many times have ref's actually disagreed with VAR, and Webb said from what I can recall twice.   so twice in the entire existence of VAR in Premier League since 2019, thats astonishing I’ll keep beating this stick. Here is the [VAR protocol for Clear & Obvious](https://www.premierleague.com/news/1297392) which outlines when an on field review is recommended.   >VAR can be used to overturn a subjective decision if a “clear and obvious error” has been identified.  >The referee will explain their decision to the VAR, and what they have seen.  >If the evidence provided by the broadcast footage does not accord with what the referee believes they have seen, then the VAR can recommend an overturn.  “No, no, no!” is all we get from Cootes as his explanation of what he saw.   The bonus at the end where he says’ “We’re giving a penalty” just shows that the on field referee is not the ultimate authority over decisions which affect the game.   This is a farce and it’s repeated time and time again every time you hear any VAR audio. The referee NEVER gives an explanation.   It boils my piss that the professional pundits have not once spoken about this blatant disregard for the Clear & Obvious protocol. Worth mentioning that Oliver is a much more senior referee than coote. The dynamic between them will always favour Oliver. With stuff like this and the dean/taylor incident its becoming increasingly clear that they should have got an out of house company to run var. You could even see on the pitch he was basically reluctant to give it when turning away from the screen. I agree with your first paragraph, but as for this:  > It’s incredibly strange that virtually every time a ref goes to the monitor, the on-field decision is going to be overruled.  I think it's quite natural and to be expected. The ref is supposed to be called to the monitor if and only if the VAR team spotted an obvious error of the referee. Cause VAR has like 3 people judging from this clip making a decision. So the on field ref would think they would have made the right call especially with replays from different angles. has there ever been a time that the on-field ref has gone with his original decision when called to the monitor by VAR? > It’s incredibly strange that virtually every time a ref goes to the monitor, the on-field decision is going to be overruled.  This is the most frustrating part of VAR in the PL to me.  They pretty much just do it for show.  I've seen once this season where the on-field ref actually stayed with his original (and correct) decision. If the on field referee is still supposed to be the ultimate authority over decisions during a game why does VAR even need to say anything. The on field referee should just be asked to review (once established that their initial assessment of the incident is incorrect), be able to request alternative angles at full speed and slow-mo and VAR should keep quiet. He was just making absolute sure he couldn't pin it on Klopp somehow. Its enforced malice, no one other than Michael Oliver see’s anything but a penalty here and in his explanation to Coote he literally states false information Oliver is 10000% corrupt He genuinely just hates United, that's all there is to it. At least one decision this blatantly wrong goes against us every time he's involved. Okay this is a mistake but it being a short review can't be an argument if we're here complaining every damn week how long it takes for VAR to look at everything. Or he just has a feeling when he sees it, a wrong feeling but people can focus on the wrong thing. who would he be corrupt for?  And the onfield ref shouldn't have changed the call. Oliver is the worst of the lot because you can tell with most of them it's incompetence, but with him you can genuinely feel malice and intent to screw teams over Ten Hag cost Ten Hag his job. Whether it was that weekend or next. Clearly michael oliver is a Man Utd fan through and through. Since he left City have lost all the matches   I blame him for the losses 😂 When did the PGMOL start moonlighting in the UAE and Saudi Pro Leagues? Brown envelopes and more control within PGMOL He wasn’t. He was as shit as the rest and I don’t know how this narrative got started that he was ever any good. You hear them say ‘does Ings have control of the ball? No.’   And it’s still given. Bizarre. That was the thing for me too. They both hit each other, but not once Ings was mentioned of missing the ball. I know recency bias is a thing, but why are VAR mistakes so common in the PL?  They are just bad, not criminals This sport lives on controversial ref calls, what else do you watch for the last 20 years lol. From Fergie's Man Utd to UEFAlona to Real's black magic to Pep's MC etc. Without controversial call England would have 0 cups not a WC lol Cootes somehow concludes at the end that theres knee to knee contact, but De Ligt has more contact than Ings??? How is that even physically possible, does De Ligt have more knees? Bigger knees?? I wouldnt be surprised if he just threw that bs in on comms so that he has a 'legit' reason on paper for giving the pen Yeah, they're not at all talking about Ings without contact on the ball either, or the fact Ings comes in just as hard, I think it's more about the fact Ings went down, wonder what would have happened if De Ligt went down?  Also, it's amazing how the wording changes team to team.  Remember last season, Ashley Young on Callum Hudson-Odoi?  Young tackles him from behind kicking his legs and the VAR called it ""Mutual contact"". Criminals? Jesus Christ. Language matters and this is so inflammatory. Referees face abuse and harassment at all levels which is only increasing, and calling people trying to do their jobs (no matter how badly) criminals is so dangerous. > These criminals man, literally ruin the sport  I hate how frequently people are using criminals in these conversations. It’s the wrong decision IMO but it’s subjective. It highlights how much negative impact VAR has on the game more than anything. But OTT language is ruining the conversations around football and making it ever more toxic.  At least pre VAR the tinfoil hat brigade were in smaller numbers. Ten Hag died for this It's not even 50/50 it's 80/20 because the ball is going towards the net and the attacker is chasing it. Makes me think of the penalties attackers seemed to consistently win for a season or two. I remember Lamela jumping in the way of Van Dijk about to clear a ball and we got a pen for it, Mane did it to Aurier and I remember Vardy and others doing it too, one of my most hated calls I despise the recent trend of punishing defenders for follow-throughs after kicking the ball. Like that's literally how kicking works?? It's not their fault someone moved into that trajectory mid swing. The only control he got/could get with the ball is with his hands too That line had me so confused. I thought they had mixed up who was attacking and defending until I remembered that West Ham are also ""United."" I agree that it reveals some bias.  VAR review keeps saying ""no contact with the ball"" but de Ligt *does* make contact with the ball, and they agree that Ings was not in control of the ball, so it's as much Ings colliding with de Ligt as vice versa i.e. a 50/50 challenge. Yeah its weird, VAR even mentions it but then seems to focus more in the knee to knee. And de ligts contact with the ball is so soft it barely changes trajectory so ings could have gotten control of it if de ligt didn't clearly kick ings foot. I dont really get why this pen is so controversial Similarly, slow motion makes everything seem more intentional, making red cards more likely. I also hate that many times those types of calls seem to be based on reputation more than anything else. If an attacker has a reputation for ""going down easy"", they never get those sorts of calls. Big ol English bloke? They'll find a pen in there somewhere. Slow motion has also been shown to increase the likelihood of a prosecution in violent crimes. You are right. But losing 6 points to bad refereeing calls is really frustrating anyway. We would've been in the top 4 by now if it wasn't for the pen at West Ham or Bruno's red card vs Spurs.  Our performances weren't inspiring by any means but piss poor refereeing does affect these games. That's what she said Delay delay delay! Yeah de ligt definitely kicked him before the knee contact but everyone here and also VAR seems to ignore it Yeah I agree.  I see so many people saying ""if I made mistakes like that in my job I'd be fired instantly!!"" Total, total bollocks. Everyone makes mistakes at work. It's just that our mistakes aren't broadcast for millions of angry football fans to watch and replay time and time again.  I do think refereeing standards need to improve and there are a lot of things going on in the organisation that are alarming (refereeing in the UAE, ahem), but some people's narrative on mistakes is ridiculous. > If you have worked anywhere, you will know that there are people who suck at their job everywhere and never see any consequences for it. I am constantly blown away by the incompetence of those in leadership positions who genuinely do not have a clue, but seem get a free pass. >  > This exact attitude is why we are in this position in the first place. It's also one of the only jobs in the world where you are berated by tens of thousands of people every time you work, and then have to come home to thousands more online calling for your head after every big decision you make. Then we wonder why we have such a hard time convincing people to become referees and have such a small talent pool to select from. >  > I agree that PGMOL needs reform, but sacking the only people we have does not seem like the best idea.  All of this is correct, and also keep in mind that to even get to the point of being eligible for selection to do the job, you have to endure thousands of hours of abuse for essentially zero pay at lower levels of the footballing pyramid. The whole recruitment chain basically excludes anyone who isn't either a masochist or abnormally driven by being an authority figure at the center of attention.  The only way we ever get better refs is by making rules that protect the ref better against abuse, and then allocating significant resources to making refereeing a valid full time career path even below the premier league level. Audience polling, everyone gets a vote. Season ticket holders get 2. [deleted] No he didn’t. How has this got 26 upvotes haha He didn't lose his job solely because of this call though Do you prefer this shit to happen ? Without complaining things don't improve. Watch the Saliba red card back. Referee says foul, yellow card, White is there to cover. VAR reviews and can see that White won’t be there in time. Sends the ref to the screen to show the ref. > How hard is it to create a procedure like what you described? How hard is it to create clearly defined phrases that prevent confusion?  Rugby shows how this can be done so well: for example, if there's a high tackle and the video ref gets involved, you can almost predict it word-for-word what will be said between the on-pitch referee and the video ref.  - Is there clear contact with the head? - Was there an attempt at a tackle? - Is there any mitigation?  The important thing is that the on-pitch referee is the lead on all of these questions. The video ref will show him the relevant footage, but it's the on-field ref who makes the decision, and often overrules any suggestions from the video ref. As ever, slo-mo video can make things look worse, and the on-pitch referee may have had a better view of the context of the tackle.  It feels like with VAR in football, or specifically in the Premier League, the A denoting ""Assistant"" is very much forgotten, and the VAR becomes the leader. The dialogue in this clip shows that. Coote said it was knee to knee. Oliver was repeatedly stating lower leg contact. No attempt to come to a consensus. The one time there was an actual question and answer, Coote asks about if Ings makes contact and the booth says no.   If they made more attempts to actually communicate, we might actually have a functional video ref system. It's all user error. Why cant we just accept that people make mistakes instead of assuming a conspiracy behind it? Just a ridiculous narrative. ""Moving into the way of the ball""....   But so is de ligt, they are just taking nonsense I guess people aren't that great at making use of audiovisual evidence No, Michael Oiver made a mistake and Coote just went along with it. I'm not saying the refs have to be perfect, but in this example you can tell they just went along with it, because Michael Oliver is a moron. Yeah you outrageously dominated us and should have been up 3-0 at HT. It's a 50/50 with neither player in control of the ball - Ings goes into De Ligt as much as the other way around so it should have stayed as the on-field decision (no penalty). I think the best angle is 0:20 where you can see both players going for the ball and contacting each other As he should be.  Refs are fine in general, this is at least an actual fuck up, unlike most of the Arsenal moans. You must be memeing?   What other clubs and managers ""ridiculed"" Arteta for calling out the refs?   Yup, it's only Arsenal that get fucked by the refs. Only Arsenal. Amorim could be worse, you just don’t know yet Of course, anyone would, But at least it is clearly admitted to be wrong by the PGMOL and therefore legitimized for all fans and prem watchers to see, which adds to the unfair and biased officiating That united fans claim. Many other clubs simply don’t even get That, But instead are just fucked over, told to take it on the chin or That is is the letter of the law shutting down any further or future debate.   It is so stupid That fan bases have begun celebrating wrong decisions affecting the opposition much more than decisions favouring their own club, while simultaneously and hypocritically whining when the opposite happens. This only happens, since the PGMOL only ever admit to their errors in select cases and not in all cases Where errors occurred… You literally got your red card rescinded the last time this happened whilst we've have 3 dodgy reds given to us explained as atypical but justified. You could tell Coote didn't agree but was afraid to overturn his superior. Alls he kept saying was ""so we have knee to knee contact..."" as if there was meant to be a ""and then?"". But there was no ""and then"", it was just that.     I thought at the time he clearly didn't agree with it, and this video has done nothing but confirm that IMO. This is a best angle to make it look like a penalty.  We don't want to show you the others because it makes it not look like a penalty! Remember this the next time they claim they can't overrule the on field ref. It's all BS. They decide on the whims of whoever wants to talk more.  Oliver *has* to be convinced it's a penalty to refer it, because it has to be a ""clear and obvious error"", and if it's clear and obvious, then the referee *should* overturn it, so why the fuck do we even have the screen? Another reason Oliver should shut up and let Coote see all the angles and make his own decision is Oliver is one of the most senior refs in the country, if he's saying it's a penalty that's going to sway Coote's opinion. if there's anything I learned after watching Coote's leaked video, it's that the man can be so easily convinced to say anything Yeah they know what they're doing. Anyone who asks for VAR to be removed is part of the problem because that is exactly what the referees want and it's crazy that some people fall straight into their hands with that. Isn’t the issue actually with PGMOL and not the refs. If there is no structure and clear processes in play that’s on the PGMOL, they’ve failed to train the refs how to sue this technology properly. Is it true though? I thought refs wanted VAR as it gives them more protection. Right but its better for the thumb because less ouchies. There's always a level of subjectivity which will cause controversy in any sport, but the overall infrastructure in place in rugby that has been there for decades now is incredible and football is genuinely decades behind the level of that sport in this regard. If you actually watch, that's not how it works. The on-field ref is not afraid to defer to the video ref. If you insist, you can see that as being the lead decision-maker and making that decision to defer, but the process consists of the on-field ref asking the video ref ""did he ground the ball?"" or whatever the relevant question is, and going with the video ref's decision. The on-field ref is the leader of a decision-making team, not a prima donna. I remember reading about this happening. Gosh imagine air traffic control communicating like these Prem refs on VAR... Probably because everyone involved in these decisions are self-centered and have egos the size of a house. Air traffic controllers are anonymous and will get fired if they screw up.  The issue are the people involved. They don't want to follow a process. Should be like rugby Video ref and field ref have a convo that's mic'd up live (they even play it in stadium speakers in some games now) Other countries have clear VAR protocols when they have released VAR footage. The PL is a bit of a mixed bag still, sometimes it's ok and they seem to follow a protocol and other times its this mess with the VAR practically convincing the onfield ref to give the penalty. It's really weird. Leaving this here too   >VAR can be used to overturn a subjective decision if a “clear and obvious error” has been identified.  >The referee will explain their decision to the VAR, and what they have seen.  >If the evidence provided by the broadcast footage does not accord with what the referee believes they have seen, then the VAR can recommend an overturn.  https://www.premierleague.com/news/1297392 It's transparent as hell that they care less about making the right call, but more about washing themselves off of the responsibility of having to make the decision. Well that's because VAR only intervenes when it's a clear and obvious error! Clearly.   Obviously. I definitely remember refs going to the monitor and staying with the original call multiple times in its early implementation.  It had to have been more than twice.   I wonder if he's just talking about the last 2 years or so.  Now it's either the call gets overturned without the on field ref ever seeing a replay or they just do what VAR says after going to the monitor. > they should have got an out of house company to run var.  In which case the PGMOL refs would just ignore VAR.   Fundamentally one of the big issues is that there is a very *old boys club* atmosphere around PGMOL. It's something which results in good refs not getting a chance, bad refs being elevated above their ability, and bad decisions being made and defended on the pitch. And I really don't see how you change that without just thorough reform rather than tinkering around the edges. There's too much pride and self-interest involved for these little changes to make a difference. >Worth mentioning that Oliver is a much more senior referee than coote. The dynamic between them will always favour Oliver.  Yes, absolutely. That's why it's so important in scenarios like this to establish a culture of open communication and flat hierarchy, where less experienced or junior members of staff are encouraged to speak up. Otherwise you will always run into issues where senior members will make a mistake with nobody daring to correct them. Not much more senior. Coote is one of the longer serving refs in the Prem. I think there's only 5 current refs with more Prem games than him (Oliver, Taylor, Atwell, Kavanagh and Pawson). That's something that was recognised decades ago in Aircraft piloting, where there have been numerous crashes due to a copilot not wanting to overrule his 'superior' - particularly in some cultures.  Professional organisations build it into training processes now.  I'm convinced the PGMOL training manual is just quotes from the Godfather films about family, It's how he starts by saying knee to knee contact but after a while changes it to De Ligt had more contact. How do you have more contact, it's physically impossible. Correct in theory. But key word ""supposed"". We know the reality is that far more than that aren't actually that obvious. Do you remember when because I can't think of an instance lol You can tell by the angle they choose. They quickly dismiss others because the contact doesn't look as bad. However from the angle behind the players you can clearly see the ball bouncing off De Ligts thigh. They make up their mind and then choose the bit of video that best supports their decision. I don't care how tinfoil hat this sounds, I genuinely believe he is. You mean the guy that's getting paid by Manchester City hates united?  He loves city, goes out of his way to fuck over their rivals. They should at least look at other angles before making their mind up. Not claim a penalty, then dismiss every other angle of the incident because it disproves their decision. There was nothing to review there. A coming together of players, that's it. This is made worse by the fact he used to be clearly the best. In the earlier-mid 2010s he was the only one you'd trust to make difficult calls in big games. Still had mistakes but he didn't feel as asinine as the others. But what he is now is a disaster so yeah could just have gone to his head but it still makes it feel more malicious.  Nah fuck that. Look yes Ten Hag probably was bound to get sacked eventually. But either way this inept decision cost him his job. Who knows what could have happened. Arteta was 1 game from a sacking and then look what happened. Are you implying the UAE is paying them to win games for West Ham? They were bad refs before covid.   They have only gotten worse since.  There is also no incentive for them to improve. There is seemingly no interest from the FA to change it, and no interest from the fans to protest it.  Officiating isn't going to change because a bunch of us bitch on social media. Because he sent off Di Maria with two yellows in a minute for a dive and dissent about the dive, that was a popular action I thought at the time, and even more so now, that David Coote still didn’t think it was a penalty but felt like he had to give it because VAR kept telling him to. yea because they can't change their decision while ref is on the monitor for some reason. I know they can but they never do. I think the ""does Ings have control of the ball?"" is suggesting that the ref knew that VAR did a mistake but then gives it anyway to protect his mate. They could’ve been super honest and said “yes, he’s got both hands on it.” well you can't just kick a player in the leg in the box for one I think what’s bizarre is they even said that to begin with, as if it’s relevant. When does “having control of the ball” or not mean it’s a foul or not when one player hits/tackles another? You guys need to move on the refs aren’t against you, it was a fair decision! Tinfoil hat? It's rigged.    Reality? Gross incompetence.  These things aren't really objective. Is it minor contact? Is it *enough* for a penalty? Etc. Mistakes can easily happen. Well firstly, they aren’t mistakes Ahh yes, because in the history of sports, officials have never been found of matchfixing or anything  One day all these frauds will be exposed and you’ll come running with your tails between your legs It’s Michael Oliver he ruins any game with united involved guy is crooked in my eyes Nah, this is solely down to Michael Oliver enforcing a decision on the game   Why a loud and open Newcastle United fan is officiating Man United games is beyond me  He is clearly influenced by the rivalry of both teams from when he was a young supporter, his clear vendetta against Man United is not well hidden Dude recieved money from the owners of one of the contesting teams and is screwing over their rivals.   Yup, sounds like an honest man. Err the ball is not going towards the net?  And its 80/20 more to the fact De Ligt made contact with the ball, Ings did not, contact was made before the collision The one that really got me last year was when Rashford got a red for standing on somebody's leg while trying to plant his foot on the ground in a skill move. It wasn't even a tackle. It's a coming together and Rshford had every right to do what he did, and it becomes an unfortunate incident. Even calling it dangerous or reckless play is wild, it's a crazy scenario that never happens. But football doesn't have much space in the laws for stuff like this. So it ends up as a red I think it’s controversial because lots of people watching are doing exactly the thing the VAR and ref are doing, and are obsessing over the wrong details. Assuming we would’ve got points against spurs is a bit of reach considering we were absolutely crap when Bruno was on the field, but I doubt we would’ve lost 0-3 with 11 men. Mate, wind it in. Don't be a revisionist. We were absolute trash against Spurs and not a single thing suggested we'd pick up our game. Spurs were on top of their game and our lot couldn't be arsed. And its not like we've got a history of turning round games we are massively dominated in under Ten Hag.   West Ham was a toss up, the ref decided the game no doubt BUT we could just as easily rolled over and allowed them a late winner, we defo had a history of that under Ten Hag. > But losing 6 points to bad refereeing calls  the penalty at West Ham only cost you 1 point.  > or Bruno's red card vs Spurs.  You think that one cost you 3 points? We weren't going to win against Spurs anyway. That fame was well lost from the start. Come on you can't seriously say you would have got 3 points against Spurs without the red card when you lost 3 nil. What were you watching against Spurs to make you think that we deserved 3 points before the red card lmao Quite a bit more than 6 points over ETHs time We both know that Spurs match was lost even without the red let's be real. Maybe we could have got 1 point from it but not 3 points. That's some huge revisionism lol I was just saying another phrase they kept repeating. This decision was a shocker.  >I see so many people saying ""if I made mistakes like that in my job I'd be fired instantly!!""  So many of these comments are during work hours as well lol Refereeing is the most brutal job in that sense. So many lapses of judgement at work are often just waved away as “whoops, lemme go back and fix that line of code,” or whatever it may be. When you make a brain fart like that refereeing football you’ve affected the most watched league in the world and now everybody thinks you’re a criminal. Don’t know that you could pay me enough to be a ref at this level. everyone makes mistakes but, within the context of refereeing, these guys are making massive mistakes all the time. you would absolutely get fired in your own job for that. mistakes which alter the results of entire matches? surely that's equivalent to monumentally fucking up in other jobs.    I recognise refereeing is a difficult job, heightened by being under the public eye. but come on, what jobs do you work where people can fuck up this badly all the time and not get fired? police or politician? The last one is the huge one imo, people complain about the lack of referees from London as if it’s some sort of conspiracy by the northern elite that control football but the reality is it’s pretty much financially impossible to work your way up the pyramid while living in London Completely agree. As somebody who enjoys the role of 'moderator' (which is why I have built a career in HR), I have thought about becoming a referee myself but have been quickly dissuaded when reading up on the experiences referees have at grassroots and the lower levels of English football.  It really needs a reform from top to bottom, which as you said, requires significant resources. Can I Phone-a-Friend? His name's Michael. Exactly - I find it funny that all these people seem to think we have a pool of incredible referees that we're just choosing not to use! You’re right, it was a history of bad results and decisions. Just like Michael Oliver. Complaining doesn’t do anything let’s be real. My point is that referees are always going to be imperfect yet people act like the sky is falling when it comes to premier league referees.   It’s blown way out of proportion when in reality they are some of the best referees in the world of soccer Because referee has made a call there so they can communicate. Because this clearly isn’t a mistake, this is Michael Oliver enforcing his will of a decision onto the referee  You can very clearly see in this clip what Oliver is saying is incorrect Less fun. Why can't we accept that there might be corruption in the play, instead of just assuming incompetence Hows it ridiculous?  When something is staring you right in the face, someones it helps to look up Sure, but that's a completely different point altogether. I replied to their ""was ignored"" which is straight up false. Refs just cave at the monitor in general, you're already under pressure and then someone is telling you that you've made an error. Just how have you managed to make this thread about Arsenal yet again?     Not to mention Bruno’s red was clearly incorrect and none of yours were.  So fucking tiresome this is. We conceded 2 goals after that red for Bruno, finishing the game 3-0, and we lost this one in the 92nd minute. Is any of that going to change? Are we getting a rematch against Spurs? Are they goning to give us the point for this match? You know a situation and process of this kind is absolutely awful if David fucking Coote is looking like the most reasonable party. Oh no but didnt you hear? Theres knee to knee contact but theres more contact from De Ligt. Yea because De Ligt has 8 fucking knees apparently. its not bs, if coote wanted more angles or time he has the authority to get it. I agree. That the on-field ref “has to determine…” is such a load of nonsense. The VAR room is making the call de facto by even asking the ref to look: the VAR room should just make the call. They did make the call. They fucked it up - that’s the real issue: The charade of the red going to look at the monitor is BS, but: How the hell did they fuck this decision up? Yeh and to add on to this one of the factors here is that Coote knows the VAR are saying it's a penalty, and if he goes with his on-field decision and then that turns out being wrong (based on court of player/club/pundit/media/public opinion) then it can really affect his career. It becomes the safe option professionally for refs to side with VAR even if they don't agree. They tried not having refs going to the screen at all.  That led to the whole Mike Dean ""not wanting to stitch up your mates"" fiasco where VAR never overturned anything at all and the monitors sat at the side of the pitch completely unused, and VAR was worse than useless. because what var thinks is not necessarily what the ref will think. ref has final authority to give it or not give it VAR has made the game more honest and I feel like 9/10 VAR calls are good but every so often there is a bad call and people will remember the bad calls. VAR is a huge improvement but the lack of clear protocols makes for messy and inconsistent interventions Or there are fans who feel that VAR has taken the emotions out of the game. Back at the top of this thread (the remarks about cricket and rugby) is why they don't want it to succeed. Using the knowledge from other sports, it could've been implemented professionally from the get-go but all we've seen is an amateur attempt at it. From Mike Dean's unwillingness to give his mate grief to ""well done boys, good process"" it's been nothing but a clown show from start to finish. The only reason it's been allowed to drag on is because the technology is being throw under the bus rather than those manning it. Yes - pretty much all elite level referees want VAR because it gives them an extra layer of protection. Ultimately, for referees at that level, it's their livelihood. They don't want to lose their career due to controversial decisions (e.g. the referee that missed Henry handball between France and Ireland many years ago).  I was fortunate to hear and see behind the scene access on VAR, including FIFA competitions, and what people accused of English VARs for tell the on-field referee is very standard practice and coaching at FIFA level. The idea is that the VAR would quickly communicate to the referee what they saw and why they thought it's a X decision, and it's up to the referee to decide.  What's odd with this situation is the lack of alternative angles. At FIFA level, the referee themselves can ask for the angle if they want (e.g. ""show me the angle from behind the goal"") and the VAR operator will bring it up.   One thing I do find a bit concerning is that the referees at FIFA level constantly get told to ""trust the technology"". But as we saw with GLT a few years ago, it's not 100%. I think some referees even took that as trust the VAR 100% It's not just rugby, it's literally every sport with a video based referee. how is that different from var?  in football the ref can make a decision from var information or, as an additional option, go to the monitor themselves. Two planes collide and the radio carries a lonely *Good process* They would need to iron out this kind of communication before they open it up for every decision that the ref comes out to the screen. Completely embarrassing that they wouldn't answer the basic question the ref was asking, which sounds like the correct thought process in this case, but not only do they never ask the question themselves (does Ings have control of the ball), but they completely ignore it when the ref brings it up. Fascinating look at this either way. We know now why refs will never not go against the var refs once their called over.  100%, this is a huge factor in crew resource management and trying to ensure power gradients don't influence decision making. Its pretty clear here that VAR had made the decision, they presented the on-field ref with one camera angle and directed him down a path where giving a penalty was the only option despite him disagreeing with it. At that point, him going to the screen is purely performative.   I actually don't mind VAR making the decision, they have the most information available and multiple people reviewing it so should be able to make a more accurate decision but their processes and communication are hilariously bad. Isaac Newton screaming from his tomb, ""no penalty, play on!"" I wish I could help but I have a terrible memory lol.  I just remember making the same complaint that going to the monitor is pointless if they just overturn it every time, then shortly after, one of the refs actually stuck with his decision.  It was a few months ago at least.  I haven't seen any other instances of it this season. And also the Newcastle United fan, who would’ve grown up with the Keegan/United drama. Shocking that he would hate United isn’t it.., Genuine question as from when this happened I had an opposing opinion from most and would like to understand where I’m wrong. For context, I think the refs and VAR are usually shit, and if this was a player on my team I wouldn’t be upset at the decision, but at the shambolic defending.   How is this *just* a coming together of players? It’s two players going for the ball, De Ligt and Ings, and one clearly impedes the other from making an attempt for the ball.   1st action: De Ligt gets to the ball first, makes a challenge for the ball, misjudges and completely misses it.   2nd action: De Ligt’s momentum from his “challenge” now projects his body forward, past the ball and into the path of Ings…  3rd action: not only does De Ligt’s momentum from his botched attempt on the ball impede Ings’ path, but also barges his knee *into* Ings *while he is still in the process of going for the ball*.  So yeah, if someone could show me where I’m wrong I’d appreciate it. If one bad referee call is the difference between keeping or losing your job, you probably deserve to be fired regardless   He was sacked after 2+ years of bad league results, not based off whether he drew/lost to west ham in that game > Arteta was 1 game from a sacking and then look what happened.  When was this out of interest?  I remember ye having a rough start with him but I don't remember hearing any rumours. Wasn't hanging around here at the time though. If he hadn't lost one in three prem games while in charge he'd be in a job. Amorin was already tapped up. He was a dead man walking. He wasn't one game away from turning it around. He would have been gone if VAR hadn't intervened in the Coventry FA Cup match and the ref hadn't bottled decisions during that game.. For the record, this was a very very soft non pen. I actually even feel for Coote in this incident (not overall, he is a dickhead)... but saying this one thing in isolation cost ETH is bonkers. They'd have had to win for him to have limped on. He'd have gone with the draw, too. Who benefits if Chelsea, United, and Villa were to get every 50 50 decision go against them? Newcastle.   Who benefits if Arsenal and Liverpool get every 50 50 decision go against them? City.   Why don't we see Rodri or Kovacic getting as many Yellows as the other midfielders who stop transition higher up the pitch? Why do we let Joelinton and Bruno G get away with murder everytime they set their foot on the pitch?  Edit: All this to say - these two state backed teams HAVE TO SUCCEED. THIS PROJECT HAS TO SUCCEED. There is a trillion dollar petro washing divestment plan in place that is contingent on these billion dollar projects being seen as successful. The only way is for City to keep winning and Newcastle to keep appearing in European competitions. Exactly. The ref will nearly always defer to VAR because they've done a much closer review than he could ever do standing on the side of a football pitch with 50,000 people watching him. As soon as the ref is called over it's basically a done deal. yeah when he says 'ok so knee to knee contact' the implication is 'no foul no penalty, just a collision' but he's immediately corrected with 'lower leg contact' which implies a 'kick' and the VAR refs never really back off after several attempts by the ref to look for support. It should never be VAR refs that tell the actual ref what to call, even if only implied. they should simply look for every relevant angle and show them to the ref. It does sound exactly like that, you can almost hear it in his voice he doesnt really believe it [deleted] I wouldn't be surprised if it's both, to be honest. The amount of decisions by Michael Oliver that go against Manchester United can not be an accident at this point. Are you implied that they are intentional? So have players and managers. Does that mean there are 25 criminals on a football pitch at the start of every game? I think if an official wanted to fix a match they’d have bigger fish to fry than fucking United West Ham Every day on here I see fans of United, City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea claim that refs are biased against their club and favour the other four.   The reality is that refs are humans and make mistakes. Another consideration is that these rules are subjective and you will never have everyone agreeing on every decision.   The rise in people claiming refs are crooked against their club is frustrating. It's largely people remembering a few decisions that went against them and the decisions that go for them or which are 50/50 are forgotten. Anyone got anymore of those tapes? We're in a bit of trouble then because when I was a kid everyone hated Man United except Man United fans. Every day on here I see fans of United, City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea claim that refs are biased against their club and favour the other four.   The reality is that refs are humans and make mistakes. Another consideration is that these rules are subjective and you will never have everyone agreeing on every decision.   The rise in people claiming refs are crooked against their club is frustrating. It's largely people remembering a few decisions that went against them and the decisions that go for them or which are 50/50 are forgotten.  I guarantee you that he will have made debatable decisions that favour United. So does arsenal football club considering their team is sponsored by the Emirates, owned by the UAE lmao. Fair it's not going exactly to the net but my point stands.  Ings isn't in control of the ball, he's barreling towards. He has a right to go for it but De Ligt gets there first.   I'm in no way saying it should be a pen even with Onana's constant calamities we make it through that group without that call being made and I am still fuming about it never in a million years was that a red I don’t get this argument, we were shit but how many times do you see a team dominate a 1st half and not a 2nd half, Christ look at city vs sporting, absolutely dominated them in the 1st half and went 1 nil up, 2nd half would not have happened if sporting got a red   It happens frequently, damn, iirc we were 2 nil up vs spurs a couple of seasons ago in the 1st half and dominated them, they ended the game 2:2 Defo not a reach, Spurs often have great halves followed by absolutely abject ones- same for united 1-0 down at half time is hardly insurmountable. Especially when we are talking of Old Trafford.   If United can do it 3-0 down at White Hart Lane, we would've definitely done it at Old Trafford. United could have very likely pulled something together to win that match. Generally though, it's Bruno that does that. I thought they’d lose by more; Bruno going off meant that they had to stop trying that stupid pretence at pressing and defend deeper, which probably saved them from an even worse loss. The team were playing very badly that day. Lads absolutely off their nut. We'd have likely only got a point vs West Ham, although were very good at throwing away points in the last minute it wasn't exactly like we were in control and there was not a single thing in that Spurs game that suggested a turn around with or without Bruno. Sporting looked like they would be run over by City first half, second half they ran over City. tactical adjustments can happen, I think is lazy to presume that we would have been run over by Spurs We did but, and we played incredibly shit in the first half, but it was 1-0 when Bruno got a red. 3 minutes after he was out we conceded again. I don't think we could've got 3 points but 1 point was still on the table. And the point of that red is that we played the entire second half with 10 people, we don't know what would've happen. I think you’re overestimating the percentage of massive mistakes. Think about how many decisions are made across the ten Premier League games each weekend.   VAR is the problem as it has given some people the false belief that all decisions will always be correct. You’re talking nonsense I’m afraid. The problem is people never think about the times referees don’t make mistakes, so the discourse is exclusively around one moment in 90+ minutes that’s used to define them. It’s simply not possible to get everything right all the time particularly given so much is subjective, and VAR has deluded idiots into thinking otherwise Not sure if even Oliver would have spent £80m on Anthony though complaining got var. complaining got goal line tech. complaining got var audio. complaining does get a lot of things going. you can downvote me all you want but it doesn't change the fact that without complaints world wouldn't evolve “no foul, I don’t think there was contact” wow such an insurmountable amount of information As long as Michael Oliver did not know better, this is a textbook example of a mistake. You can be wrong and convincing without being corrupt. Because it's a serious accusation and you would have to have proof of that.   People invent conspiracies because they cannot deal with reality. And the reality is that the job of a referee is very difficult and blatant mistakes happen at the highest level. Because that’s not how things work, ever.  You don’t jump to the worst conclusion and then look for evidence to suggest otherwise. Assume the most realistic, simple answer and then go from there.  They might be corrupt, but it seems way more likely that they’re just bad/inconsistent at their jobs. Because it has no basis in reality, most of the time people say it after a difference of opinion.  At least this is an actual error, he saw it differently and wrongly, hardly corruption.  Also now refs are corrupt against United lol. You realise the reds impacted our game too AS WELL AS our future games? He got the ban for next weekend, he was the only one who questioned if ings had control of the ball...nuts really.  A superior is not going to be overuled, the scheduler should get the ban. Him having the authority and not using it proves my point.  They didn't fuck it up. They wanted united to lose the game! There's no need trying to crack your head over something so simple, these refs are corrupt. > The VAR room is making the call de facto by even asking the ref to look  no, because what conclusion var arrive at is not necessarily what conclusion the ref will arrive at. the ref made the call, not var Oh let's be clear, I'm advocating going to the screens *more*. I want the ref to be able to say ""not sure about that one, let me see a replay and I'll decide"" like they do in rugby. Fuck clear and obvious. Bring in ""not quite sure"". You're not getting the point. If it's subjective, it's not ""a clear and obvious error"", it's ""debatable"" and that isn't what VAR is supposedly for. So the VAR has to believe that there is no debate possible, that it is definitely an error. In which case either the referee isn't actually needed to check a damn thing or the VAR isn't good enough at their job, and in either case, the screens are pointless.  The fact that we send a referee to the screens *at all* proves either that the idea of ""clear and obvious error"" is not the bar that is actually set, or that the screens are pointless, so that idea needs to be laid to rest in any case. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5QlBHF6ib8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5QlBHF6ib8)  England fans were really glad that this was never reviewed.  They'd much rather have the emotions. 😂 welll done lads [https://www.espn.com.au/football/story/\_/id/40894476/how-var-decisions-affect-premier-league-club-2024-25](https://www.espn.com.au/football/story/_/id/40894476/how-var-decisions-affect-premier-league-club-2024-25)  This says none so far I appreciate you setting out your thoughts, though i strongly disagree with what you are saying. I think you have read it the same way as Oliver, and missed a lot of what is happening.  Both players are reaching for the same ball. Neither has possession to start with, and neither is more likely to get possession than the other. Their legs collide. You seem to infer that it is fine for Ings' leg to hit De Ligt, but not fine for De Ligt's leg to hit Ings. This is not the case, and is why it is generally being referred to as a 'coming together'. Neither player has a right to this possession.  I would also argue that only one of the two players actually makes any contact with the ball, and that is when it hits De Ligt's thigh. Ings never makes contact with the ball, so surely De Ligt has that on his side.  Also, Ings is already falling forwards before he reaches the challenge. You can see by his body position at the moment of contact that he is falling down whether challenged or not.  Not only do I think this was not an incident where VAR should have got involved. I don't think it is in any way a foul, wherever it happens on the pitch. I think the argument Ings fouled De Ligt is at least as strong as the other way round. Honestly, I think it probably shouldn't have been given based off it being a bit harsh and the referee's onfield decision...but the incident itself is probably a foul.   In my mind they have got the process wrong more than the eventual decision. If the ref had awarded it, I don't think they would have needed to intervene either.   It's just a bad use of VAR. I with you. To be straight this is the first time I’ve actually seen the challenge, but from what I understood of social media there was no way in the world it was a pen and the refs got it completely wrong…but honestly I can see how this is given. The defender kicks to play the ball and completely misses and makes contact with the attacker in the box. Foul anywhere else on the pitch. Penalty in…. He won y’all two cups bro. Think Tottenham how many cups have they won? The Chelsea game on Boxing Day 2020 I believe. Really felt he had to win that or he was gone. Saka and Smith Rowe had good games and we were basically on the up since then Agree. How do you thjnk City won almost all their games. 80% of fouls go City ways. Rodri handball. Arsenal always ending up with 10 players against City. Woah now, the mental transition from rugby has been difficult for Bruno over the years. I heard he took out some gran's center of gravity when she dropped an eggplant recently. Just complete muscle memory. This would imply that no decisions ever go against Newcastle or City.  I can't speak for City because I don't really watch them, but we've also been on the end of awful refereeing decisions countless times.  Weren't Wolves the most effected last season? What's the game there? In this situation it's not just because VAR did a closer review. It's also because a more senior ref, Michael Oliver 'suggested' that it should be given, so he didn't really have a choice in the matter. Yeah there's a whole load of dynamics going on with VAR which fucks with the decision making process. It's why I will always prefer pre-VAR football, even with the mistakes. The ref always made the decision and once it was made, it was made. It's just a mess now It's how Coote starts saying De Ligt had more contact. If two people bump into each other how does one have more contact than the other. Just making things up at that point to justify giving the Penalty that VAR wants to give. Thank you for your response.   I feel like there is a clear answer to “who’s to say it’s De Ligt’s fault?” and the answer is partly in my other comment under this post. It’s down to what is a football play.  De Ligt goes for the ball before Ings does. That’s a good thing. If he gets the ball, then it negates whatever contact is made after, especially in this case as it’s non-violent/dangerous. However, he doesn’t get the ball (or at least doesn’t change its trajectory). His momentum same challenge he makes for the ball and misses, carries him past the ball and into Ings’ path. The key point is that Ings is still in the process of going for the ball. Normally, being second to a challenge could be seen as “bad” and puts the player at fault. However, since De Ligt misses the “football play” (aka the ball), he is now impeding Ings from making a “football play”.   If they both were going for the ball at the same time and were equidistant from the ball, then I agree with you as it would completely just be a coming together.   However, as I said, De Ligt had his moment to make a football play, botches it (which can be seen as purely bad defending), and then when it’s Ings’ turn to make the football play, gets impeded. The amount of decisions by Michael Oliver that go against football (everyone except Manchester City) can not be an accident at this point. It isn't bias against United. Arsenal have it worse than us.  Oliver just loves making controversial calls in big games. I suspect it is to prove he ""isn't intimidated"" but instead he just looks like an idiot. Effectively the refereeing equivalent of small man syndrome.  There's always a referee that has to make centre of attention calls in big games. All the way back to David Elleray, the earliest I can remember, there's always been somebody who has to prove the occasion isn't intimidating them by giving some back page grabbing decision. United fan here, I don't think that Oliver is against us. He's just a really bad ref with an ego that isn't earnt and he self-inserts all of the time. Yes, I wholeheartedly believe match officials intentionally make certain decisions, not all. Just some.  This being one Potentially, we only find out when they get caught, god knows how many have been getting away with it  I mean a player has multiple rape charges against them and is still knocking it about the pitch  Mason Greenwood battered his missus and stilll going etc Everyone knew Eric Ten Hag was on the chopping block for the sack, everyone, it was no secret  There is potential for financial gain for a referee to place a bet for next managerial sacking and then proceed to influence the result’s of which   You can pass it off as ‘oh its just west ham v man u’ all you like, cover your eyes all you want mate  I wont Good thing that most of the refs are from Manchester then. Coincidentally majority of match officials are from the north west   Shocker, I know As a complete neutral I know that Michael Oliver has a distinct issue with Man United  Every time Michael Oliver is involved with a Man United game there's almost always controversy  Michael Oliver has never awarded a penalty similar to that or will award one going forward  If you think this specific decision is remotely 50/50 then you've lost it, this is in no way a penalty at all Nah I’m not saying we couldn’t have brought it back with 11 men,  I’m just saying it’s bold to assume we’d have got 3 points and be in the top 4 if there was no red card, especially given how we were playing. Yeah but there’s could have and would have is what I was saying. Saying we’d be top 4 if not for that red card just shifts all the blame onto the refs and totally neglects our crap performances we lost a lot of games at OT under ETH. I would not put faith in us turning that game around > Especially when we are talking of Old Trafford.  Blud here thinking its 2013 Of course we’d have been in a much better position considering he’s our best and most creative player, but whether we’d have won is hard to say given how we were playing.   Also it was a totally different United side with a much better mentality and manager that came back from 3-0 at white heart lane.  > If United can do it 3-0 down at White Hart Lane, we would've definitely done it at Old Trafford.  When did we come back from 3-0 down at White Hart Lane? Are u fucking dull? Are u referencing a strong United side with Beckam, Giggs, Van Nistelrooy etc under Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the best, arguably the best manager of all time at coming back in big games from decades ago to try and prove how you could comeback under that poor Ten Hag side? And another thing is, you played significantly better with 10 men than 11 in that game you lost to Spurs this season.  Maybe you could have came back with 11 men (doubt it) but that was the worst way to try and make a point Mate, we played like shite against Spurs end of. Dalot not tracking back, their CB running through our defence like butter? Bruno on or off it wouldn’t make a difference. Spurs completely annihilated us. I think it is lazier to presume that the red card cost you all 3 points. The cope is outrageous to be clear, I'm not advocating for just ""fire everybody"" like the original comment. of course people make mistakes and I don't think every little thing the ref gets wrong is of the same severity. the issue is that we have the technology to correct these things, to counter human error, and instead the process plays out like the audio in this post. Don’t forget Anthony Taylor, possibly even more incompetent than Antony These are all things that you all still complain about, no sport is going to be perfect as you seem to expect. And I didn’t downvote you but who tf cares about a single downvote on Reddit anyways bro But he’s not talking to the VAR in that moment, he’s talking to his ARs. By saying no no no he’s implying no contact, and he still had to watch the game because he hasn’t blown his whistle.   it’s up to VAR to find no calls and tell him to delay the game (which they rightly did). The VAR did not incorrectly judge this as a coming together because of the process or anything the on field referee said. Saying “I didn’t see contact” is not gonna prevent the VAR from erroneously judging the contact made to be a foul. It’s not a textbook mistake  He clearly lies in his explanation and writes off concerns presented by the on field official as nothing in order to award the penalty decision  No one else thinks this is a penalty except for Michael Oliver and it’s why he has openly lied about contact on the ball from De Ligt which on 2/3 viewings his visible  Coote did not want to award the penalty, only Oliver  Oliver does not act as an advisory assistant to Coote like we have been told multiple times for the PGMOL is how the VAR team works  This decision solely lies at the feet of Michael Oliver But I am not accusing. I am refusing to believe that someone will be this incompetent. I am trusting his talent quality.  Job of a referee is very difficult but in this case it was on Coote. He was the referee. Oliver saw the video, slow motion, different angles and Coote asked him some good questions but Oliver didn't satisfied him.   Now agaiy, I am not accusing but there definitely can be different opinions and given the evidence, it will make me wonder that he is corrupt. Who say’s there’s no bias in it?  Michael Oliver is a Newcastle United fan, loud and proud at that, during his time as a young Newcastle fan would have been when the rivalry between both clubs were strong, Oliver would have been at least 10 when Keegan had his infamous outburst  This is not a mistake, he quite literally states a lie and disregards the onfield officials questioning as nothing  Michael Oliver PUSHES the decision to award the penalty, that is not what the VAR team id hired to do  ‘Refs corrupt against Man U lol’, that comment right there just sums it up tbh it only possibly proves that the ref did not do a good enough job of asserting himself  it does not prove that oliver/VAR ""took the decision away from Coote"" or that var ""overruled the onfield ref"". because they didn't Then its not clear and obvious. Clear and obvious should be all but the most blinkered of fans should go 'yeah that's a pen' let alone professional top level refs who know the laws of the game inside out. Otherwise, leave it too the on field ref! Yeah, if the bulk of knowledgeable[\*\] people the next morning think you fucked up, you better overturn the decision.  I don't know what that language needs to be exactly, but ""clear and obvious"" and ""high bar for intervention"" and ""we don't want to be re-refereeing games"" are all not getting the right answers and need to get thrown out.  [\*\] Note that the word ""knowledgeable"" here is doing a lot of work, and is excluding most redditors and a lot of the TV commentators, I'm not talking about a democracy. > If it's subjective, it's not ""a clear and obvious error""  this is just false.   clear and obvious is subjective. what one person might think is a foul another might think is not a foul.   >So the VAR has to believe that there is no debate possible, that it is definitely an error.  no, var has believe that a clear and obvious error was made, which is why they suggest the ref to have a second look. youre pulling this ""var must think no debate is possible"" from nowhere. That’s goal technology not VAR I still have PTSD from Rodri scoring a last minute goal when he should have been off before half time... >Michael Oliver  Seems like a lot of interesting things happen with this guy involved. I feel like if there are hierarchies within the refereeing body, official or otherwise, they should be respected when assigning refereeing teams, with the most senior reff getting the main reff position everytime.   It's silly to have the guy that's supposed to make the call be hesitant because someone he sees as his superior is in the assistant position. not trying to defend the decision here, but the usage of ""contact"" refers to blame and intensity, not the literal ""touching"" aspect.  If someone stands still and I charge and bump into them, I have more ""contact"", otherwise fouls could never be given and Zizou could claim Materazzi's chest made as much contact with his beautiful bald head as his beautiful bald head made with Materazzi's chest. >  Just making things up at that point to justify giving the Penalty that VAR wants to give.  I can't wait for the ultimate end game where every single open play goal is disallowed for a millimetre offside or a foul 5 mins before and the only goals ever scored are the 5-10 penalties given every game. Wasn’t he paid by City group to ref a game? I know you guys love crying, but City are the receiving end of bad calls too. Tottenham-City, and Hwang not being sent off in the Wolves City game where he scored the game winner off the top of my head happened last year. He’s not exclusively against us, him refereeing United vs Arsenal may end up with 8 red cards and the best score for city’s interests I mean managers and players have literally been caught fixing matches in the same way referees have. If that means *all* referees are criminals, then surely *all* managers and players must be, too - including those at your club, same as at any other club.   At which point it's pretty silly focusing on exclusively on referees and calling all of them criminals, I reckon. Bahahahahahahahahahaha Specifically - from Manchester, grew up in the 80s and 90s, have no positive or negative opinion of Manchester United or Liverpool.  Mad really. That’s not true. There’s more refs from Yorkshire than Greater Manchester for example. Which is directly related to the popularity of football in that region and the economic situation that makes it more attractive to those in that area than the south.  I think you should look at the [places they are from too and see how many are from Yorkshire.](https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league-referees-teams-support-32657499) > As a complete neutral I know that Michael Oliver has a distinct issue with Man United  Well no you don’t **know** that, you believe it which is different.   > Every time Michael Oliver is involved with a Man United game there’s almost always controversy  Well this is exaggerating things.   > Michael Oliver has never awarded a penalty similar to that or will award one going forward  Of course he and plenty of other refs have awarded penalties in similar circumstances with a coming together in the box.  > If you think this specific decision is remotely 50/50 then you’ve lost it, this is in no way a penalty at all  Oh look the classic Reddit comment where someone incorrectly claims someone wrote similar and then criticises them for this phantom unwritten point. Maybe try reading my post again and replying to what I actually wrote. Yeah you were getting absolutely battered at 11v11, it was grim Again, our performances were really bad but would run it back again with 1-0 at halftime with Bruno on the pitch, if you had the option? He's referring to a different team under a different manager, in 2001 🤣 If you’re refusing to believe that someone will be this incompetent then I don’t think you understand how hard refereeing is ""They decide on the whims of whoever wants to talk more."" i disagreee. it's subjective and two people can difference of opinions   also clear and obvious is about what the ref communicates too. like the ref saying ""i saw the contact but didn't think its enough force to warrant to a foul"" is a lot different than the ref saying ""yeah i saw the incident and there was zero contact"", so yeah that plays a part too in whats considered an obvious error. Okay. Sure. Feels like semantics - introducing new technology to ensure that the rules of the game are fairly enforced and that the results and decisions are correct and deserved.  This is the aim of goal line technology as well as VAR.  The implementation of VAR is the biggest problem, and is ultimately the cause of the largest resistance to it.  If VAR was implemented more effectively, then I think you would see that it doesn’t remove the emotions from the game in any significant way.    On a personal level, I’d rather see a fairly reffed match end with a deserving winner, than a match with lots of controversies and talking points where both teams feel aggrieved. The amount of tactical fouls they commit and get away is outrageous. Remember Trossard red card against City Never trusted the man that once reffed a game with tram lines on the side of his head if you only defer to another ref how do you ever become a senior ref?  the passage of time where you never made an actual call for yourself? It would actually be interesting if the VAR set-up would be that the on-field ref wouldn't know who the VAR is. Communication would be text based or with the voice masked in an attempt to control hierarchy bias. Yes, in Qatar or UAE or somewhere over there. I didn't say all officials are criminals  If you ask yourself who are the English officials constantly in the headlines?  Anthony Taylor, Michael Oliver, Chris Kavanagh, Chris Pawson, Stuart Atwell  You never really hear from Coote (video leak aside), madley, Brooks,  Barrot, Bankes, Hooper etc.  Most people can name the same 6/7 referee's but couldn't even name the other 15/16 referee's in the league, that, speaks volumes You laugh but we literally had a match officials who got done for match fixing as the officials for a Euro’s semi final this summer   These referee’s are untouchable and they know it I think what is actually mad is how many people parrot incorrect information while raging against alleged corruption.  There’s more refs from [Yorkshire in the Premier League than Manchester](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-14072199/David-Coote-Premier-League-Liverpool-referee-supports.html). Don't believe every myopic tweet or Reddit comment you read. There are roughly a similar amount of referee's registered in Lancashire and the surrounding area's as there are in areas such as London, Durham etc  There's double the registered referee's in Essex than there is Manchester and greater manchester One of the least sensible ways of trying to prove a point I’ve seen here Sure, I understand the argument that it makes things fair, but after 6 years with VAR, there's still just as much debate about refereeing decisions. I don't think it matters if referees follow protocol; football will always be hard to judge. I watch everything from Premier League to amateur football. It's only the games with VAR decisions that create incredible frustration. Almost all games worldwide are played without VAR, and it works perfectly well. The position of referees has beenworse, I perceive more hate directed at them since VAR was introduced. Now you're just rubbing salt in the wounds... 😭 Or, hear me out, we could have VAR techs not be official referees! Or rather, be an orthogonal position with differing skill sets. You do need knowledge of the rule book, but there are way too many skills you don't need (stamina, positioning, ability to ref from the sidelines...) while there are many skills that you need for VAR and not for referring like ability to communicate clearly, knowledge of the technology (enough to direct a tech and to be aware of the common failing points)...     Let's be honest, a video ref doesn't need much more than a couple months training on the rules, league guidelines and communication protocols. Unlike training new refs, training new people for the VAR room would be incredibly easy. And, I'd argue, that having the VAR not be someone inserted in the dynamics and politics of the refereeing body would always contribute to impartiality. Refereeing a game from inside the pitch is incredibly hard. Refereeing a game from the VAR room? Let's be honest, most blokes are pretty okay at giving the right call from a single replay when watching a neutral game. Some divided opinions on hard to judge situations but VAR guidelines are ""clear and obvious"" so it shouldn't even matter. Besides, if VAR is a random stranger, the refs will be far more likely to challenge their opinions when presented with the images.   The one thing that boggles my mind is that it always seems like the VAR is looking at a single view of the game at the time... Like, the room is full of screens with all the different cameras, but the communication is always focused on ""show me such and such view on the big screen"" and it's always discriptive language, not just ""screen #4"". Which implies that while there are techs looking at all camera angles, the main VAR... *isn't*. Which makes sense as that's not something he's trained to do... But certainly there job is to catch shit the main ref didn't... and the biggest tool they have for that is a huge array of view points!  I think training a sports video producer (the guy deciding which scene to show for TV) to be a ref might produce better results than training a ref to look at multiple screens and figure out momments of interest. Why would the city group pay Oliver to ref in Qatar? There’s no shot you think match fixing happening in the German amateur leagues means that referees in the biggest league in the world are fixing matches, especially for a plan as monumentally stupid as betting on Ten Hag next sacking Which isn’t telling us anything about the amount of people pursuing it as a profession. My point was about Premier League referees which means full time professionals. They have to leave their job to become full time professionals referees. I'm not certain if we're going to agree, and that's ok.  You're watching more levels of football than I am.  My experience with it, and perspective is almost exclusively limited to the EPL.  I think the majority of backlash that the referees are suffering are a result of their inconsistency, and the fans attempting to reconcile if it's incompetence, bias, or corruption.  With recent situations like what's happening with David Coote, or known Liverpool fan Jarred Gillet making a controversial call on VAR which would benefit Liverpool in the following match, it's not hard to understand why there is a diminished level of trust in the referees and VAR officials.  I strongly suspect that PGMOL/the referees never wanted VAR to be included, and given that they haven't worked with any other sports that have successfully implemented VAR, and are hoping to just sort of figure it out as they go - I think their resistance is manifesting in the form of incompetence.  Whether this is planned incompetence, or born of arrogance, the fact that they haven't looked to other sports to figure out how they can use VAR in football tells  me that they never actually wanted it to succeed.  I've always felt that they sort of hoped that they could get rid of it if people didn't like it, and they know how to make people not like it.  At no point, have I felt that they've given VAR a fair chance at success, or taken it seriously.  If they had, there would have been more rigorous training, and actual officials whose job is specifically to monitor VAR.  I think there are a lot of reasons that refs are facing more ""hate"" right now, and while VAR may be part of it, I think their implementation of VAR is probably more culpable.  Either way, thank you for having a discussion with me about this! UAE To bribe him? Yes I do, I really do.  Ex pro ref Mark Halsey has stated plenty of times the PGMOL control the games God I want to live in your fantasy, it sounds so much more exciting than real life ‘Fantasy’  Haha, keep yourself blinded all you like, it will all get leaked soon enough You’re right bro it’s all a grand conspiracy that sheeple like me haven’t uncovered, thank god we have you on the case to open our eyes"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* I have to admit whenever I’ve seen De Ligt play for United I’ve not been blown away or even thought he’s decent but that might speak more to Uniteds tactics and general style of play than it does of De Ligt.    That said Maguire has never really been cut any slack due to the way United play/set up so it’ll be interesting to see if people will use it as a reason for De Ligt not looking amazing. It's been 6 games I mean in fairness I think most players would fail in that system/ environment. United has been a graveyard for most players coming in for years now, with very few exceptions. There are players there that could move to other clubs and really step up their game and look like solid players again I mean I agree. Maguire has been pretty good after he gained his confidence back.  De Ligt can improve though. Well, I've very slowly come round to the thought that if Sancho is now getting assists and Ugarte/De Ligt are now shit then it might be the system Scholes is proof that fantastic players don’t necessarily understand football as a whole Scholes isnt a fan of dutch players, i see. Sure, let's blame the defender when our tactics are complete shite. We want to play with high fullbacks with our midfield covering the gaps left by fullbacks when they move up the pitch leaving our defenders to handle the rest. Except this doesn't work as opponents simply overload the midfield and pass through our defence using the extra man.   Stupid tactics which doesn't work in PL. Sometimes players just are who they are. Many fans I think cling on to the hope of potential, but huge jumps in ability are very rare and less often sustained. Look how they massacred my boy...  From our best CB and fan favorite to essentially getting called worse than Maguire. Makes me even more sad that he was sold. Or maybe the issue is something with the club, everyone looks shit there, lol. De Ligt is a very good player. He is also entirely overrated on reddit - across multiple subs nonetheless. He is still pretty young and CB’s tend to improve with age. He has a no-nonsense attitude about defending that brings a confidence that is visibly noticeable. He has leadership qualities and a positive attitude on the pitch. A potential captain if you ask me. He plenty of very good qualities.  The other side of this is that he failed to nail down a starting spot at both Bayern and the Dutch national team. To be fair he has had great competition including Van Dyke, De Vrij, Ake, Upamecano, Kim, Hernandez, Dier, and others. I’m not even joking about Dier he looked good under Tuchel to be honest. I think De Ligt can still get better and feature for a top team, but he has not shown to be that player yet. Bayern didn’t sell at a loss because they needed to. Plenty of time to become that guy though - hope he does it. De ligts peak and potential are sure better than Maguire.   Right now? I think Maguire has a slight edge over him Forgetting the fact that De Ligt is there to replace Varane not Maguire. Is there a way to filter out these scholes articles. I would rather kill my brain with alcohol than his shit takes. He’s a massive upgrade lmao. The system and manager is shit. Unfortunately Scholes is a muppet with everything punditry related If we're looking at Maguire's start of last season he was player of the month.  De Ligt hasn't been anywhere near that so I see where he's coming from. But if you look at the players they've bought in it just seems like they've been robbed or badly scouted.   ●De Ligt & Mazaraoui both were 2nd options and a season or two away from being sold out of Bayern squad.  ● Ugarte was a 3rd choice DM from PSG, he isn't a massive player and they could've gotten him for half price by January. Or better yet bought one of the Nottingham Forest DMs or Halfbacks who are insanely underrated btw.   *Said this in threads when he got signed and apparently I'm a blind bafoon who can't see talent according to Utd fans*  ●Zirkzee was never going to fit well on a team which plays through wingers. Just ruins Zirkzee's reason to be a player who can drop deep and hold up the ball fir the team to set up plays for him or themselves.   Good example of this would be his Bologna v Roma game. Ten Hag's play does not fit him, Johnathan David would've been a much better fit.   *I've said the same exact thing when they signed him but according to Utd fans I'm clueless lol*  ● Leny Yoro was the only signing I can see being really worth his money.  Quite literally most of their signings were players who weren't starting on teams which United rate below themselves as a club. And somehow they've managed to overpay.  Edit: I've realized this is r/soccer and not prem sub lmaoooo welp, i ran out of salt so ig its good timing lol. De Ligt is a clear upgrade over Maguire, and this is his first season in premier league.That being said, Maguire isn't as bad he is portrayed in the media (especially last season), so there not being a big difference is understandable. They're similar sort of defenders. Similar strengths and similar weaknesses. I see where scholes is coming from. Paul Scholes isn't allowed to cross the street without a grown up. Man Paul should have just stayed retired and off the media.   De Ligt isnt a fix for the issues at UTD but is certainly an upgrade to Maguire, not saying Maguire is crap.   Man U if they had a competent manager now have one strong defence, apart from LB which they still rely on a crippled man. Doesn’t matter what defenders united buy when their off the ball structure  is terrible and easy to play through. When Man Utd signed De Ligt, as a joke, I told a couple of Utd fans they'd signed the Dutch version of Harry Maguire.   I would piss myself laughing if he has a couple of dodgy games. I'm gonna be straight on to my mates and on here peddling that shite Ignoring the comparisons about these two players' careers and form, etc, surely if De Ligt is a better option than Lindelof, Evans, and Kambwala it's an upgrade in depth over last season which is also important. This is too much - talk about the tactics sure but de Ligt literally just arrived and has been playing in a completely unsettled side. Sure it may be hard to see a big difference at the moment, but as someone who's watched Maguire extensive and de Ligt a number of occasions I can safely say that Maguire is MUCH worse handling low balls and accelerating into key positions on defense and offense (which is why Maguire is fine on defensive headers because there's typically plenty of time whereas on offense he's always had trouble getting to spots on his own without help from other players to screen on corners). Tack on that de Ligt is 25 and Maguire is 31 which shows that Ineos is trying to build a squad for years down the road and not just tomorrow. Love you Scholes, but think about things more carefully before you spurt out nonsense Would be interested to see how many times Scholes watched De Ligt before he came to united to have this opinion. Maguire was always a good defender, if he had only been bought by 40 million he would be a starter in the team nowadays, people shit on him even when he did good, specially in his first seasons, due to the price tag Hook or by crook, british media will always support their own countrymen (regardless whether they are on form or not) Thank you De light for leavening Juve. So far you have proved to be a mediocre player. Wtf is Scholes smoking lol De Ligt is far and beyond what Maguire is capable of not to mention he has a completely different playstyle, one that fits the current system. On every single list he is without a doubt in the top 10 worldwide right now.  This is English bias all the way. Also, did we forget 70k Bayern fans petitioned to KEEP him? These nonsense comments are getting ridiculous. What a brain-dead take, it takes players time to adapt to a new league and playing style. I don’t get what Scholes obsession is with De Light. He is markedly better than Maguire Even guys like Pogba, Casemiro, Varane and Cr7 wasn't themselves in that club lol. I think most realised we wouldn’t be getting MDL if he was still on a trajectory to be top tier. But he is still a longer term replacement for what we had and a solid one at that. Between him and Yoro and Martinez I’m quite comfortable. It’s the midfield area which I think is totally out of kilter, and then our forwards are injury prone/or developing/or very hot and cold. But they could use with a better system too. With all due respect to Sir Alex Ferguson, with very few exceptions of his former players, almost none of them have gone on to become successful managers, I sometimes ask myself why? All of them just talk about ""run more, want more (passion merchants)"" Maguire is fucking woeful and I’m sick of English pundits trying to gaslight us into believing he’s a good player just because he plays for their national team. De Ligt is miles better. Fucking constant English bias being shoved down our throat. I think anyone who has eyes and isn't trying to get clicks can see he's a much better defender.  I still don't get why pundits are still singling out players.   11 players in the United team have been atrocious, every sub that comes on is atrocious.   At some point you have to start saying it's not the players. De Ligt is a good defender, but honestly. More impressed by Maguire. Never a poor footballer but since gaining confidence he's a different player. He's pretty good. Still disappointed in De Ligt for not stepping up Lmao i knew this was coming. United are just shit collectively right now. De ligt is definitely better than Maguire. The only reason he didn’t have a starting spot at Bayern for most of last season was due to injury and Tuchel icing him out to maintain consistency in the backline. Just look at the season before that were De ligt was one of the best players in a lackluster Bayern side, even scoring a few long range goals I am sick of ex Man United legends/players milking the club for their media money. They don't understand how to run a club, almost all of them couldn't even manage a tier 2 league club and keep talking shit. Many of them were famous for being dense as players too (outside the pitch). Why do we get forced to listen to Paul Scholes, dudes an idiot, on top of being a fucking weirdo. Something's really wrong with that club if they make De Ligt look useless. Like the whole structure of that team, from top to bottom, has to be completely rotten for so many amazing players to end up looking shit the moment they set their foot in that disaster of a club. De Ligt deserves way better. Maybe give a guy more than 5 matches at a new club to form an opinion on him.  This new age of instant gratification is making following any sport much more difficult. I'm sure De Ligt was not de-ligt-ed to hear that.  I'll see myself out. Yeah no Paul The takes am reading on de ligt recently… fans of the teams he’s been on speak far higher than supporters of other clubs who clearly haven’t watched him play. I think it is a little too soon to throw De Ligt under the bus. its a collective effort so bit early to judge He has basically been Maguire.  A real threat from set pieces. Wins every aerial ball at the back.  Slow as treacle at the back, and steps up out of position and gets skinned by attackers. In fairness he did get MOTM one game. My grandmother would be an upgrade over maguire. And she’s dead. Usually I would agree with Scholes, but Holy fuck he is drunk on Scotch for commenting this. De Ligt is too slow to play in such an open system. How many other top 6 clubs have defenders as slow as De Ligt and Maguire? I was watching the Utd match (missed the first 5 mins fortunately), it was a while before I realised that it was De Ligt rather than Maguire playing.   This is not covered in the above quote but it's perhaps not a comparison of who is better so much as they are very similar players in build and style.   This is strange considering Maguire was frozen out for a while, the supposed reason given that he was the wrong sort of player for 10H. lol Paul shut up like you did as a player. We don’t need two Gary Nevilles. Just the one is enough. Yes he is. He is the best at United now It’s becoming clearer to me that it might be a club problem rather than an individual problem. For some reason, every better than average players brought in become mediocre when playing for this club. Not gonna lie I didn't realise De Ligt was as slow as he is, absolute tanker This dude wants to be a head coach so hard. I guess he gonna do it in has pants if they put him I actually thought De Ligt was Man Uniteds best player vs Spurs I dont think Fergie bought Smalling and Jones expecting them to be a lot better than Rio and Vidic. De Ligt is 25 compared to Maguire at 31 and cost £39m which is a pretty standard fee. Even if he isn't a massive upgrade on Maguire (and I don't agree with Scholes that he's been worse) as a potential squad player in the future he's a decent purchase (Yoro is obviously who they are targeting to be the starter in seasons to come). The Glazer's are a cancer, judging a player on his Performance is pointless.  When the owners hate football and look on it's fans as cows to milk and players as financial assets not sportsmen then how can anything improve.  Players go to United for an easy pay check not to win football games.   You can't upgrade unless players see an opertunity to succeed. I'm so unbelievably happy we didn't sell Branthwaite to United. I am also of the opinion that Martinez is not an upgrade on Maguire. I just don't see it. former united players crapping on their new signings is peak. way to instill confidence in de ligt Paul. As great man once said - it’s a graveyard for players.. ""is Man United an upgrade over Bayern Munich? absolutely not"" I feel like he’s both insulting Maguire and De Ligt at the same time. Maybe they’re both pretty decent defenders and the way the manager has them set up is wrong. But he’s dutch! You can give him back anytime De Ligt is a good player but not world class. To be fair these are the players who we can sign as a mid table team. He’s still pretty young though. De Ligt is 10 times the player Maguire is. Scholes is just moaning about everything and pretending the whole thing is bad from top to bottom which is a lazy analysis. He is right about how many new players have come in and yet nothing seems to have changed; however, I don't think it's down to completely awful recruitment or that United is just a talent vacuum and we should accept that at face value.   The tactics have been what they are for a season and a half. A good portion of last season had some noise around injuries but now with a bunch of new players coming in, stronger depth at each position, the players still look just as clueless as they were before and ten Hag's doing nothing to change this approach.  The problem isn't that Maguire or De Ligt can't play. It's that the midfield is too far away from the CBs in buildup play so when those defenders get pressed, they struggle. It's also happening to Ugarte and Casemiro too so it's not isolated to the CBs either. The fullbacks also seem to be doing a poor job of tracking runners. De ligt has been good. He's scored a goal and he's been an aerial threat on offense as well. The midfield has been absolute trash. They can't create or stop.   The coaching is the problem. No one can look good if everyone is scattered all over the place. They look like chickens without a head out there. Depressing soccer. Even the guys I play with once a week have more organization and better ball movement. I mean its actually a pretty fair comparison. Both of their best attributes are their size, strength, and leadership. De Ligt is a bit better on the ball but he's not Beckanbauer or anything. They're both too slow to play a high aggressive line. De Ligt was brought when Yoro got injured, and I don’t think he’s done badly for us tbh. I think the system/tactics is at fault. I like him. Many others played worst than him this year. I don’t trust Carraghers assessment of him It is sport team and especially when you have no control over your midfield no matter how good ur defense or goal keeper they will always look bad players. United can’t control their midfield Jeez give them some time atleast. De Ligt hasn't even looked bad. Both him and Mazraoui have settled in seamlessly given its a completely new league and team for them. Obviously they will play it safe for now and will take more risks once they're settled in. Wild thing to say 5 years ago Well De Ligt is younger, so at least it makes sense to sign him as long term replacement or something. Man united shirt has -30 all stats debuff. De ligt looks very mediocrep Weird how every player in the past 10 years comes down a level in quality as soon as they put the United shirt on. Almost like they need to fix problems behind scenes and stop pointing fingers at the players and transfers. I find it baffling that after all these years, coaches, and players, Man United fans and pundits  continue to blame coaches and players when the obvious problem at United is and has always been (since Fergie left) its club culture. Constant negativity and lazy criticism from the ex-player pundits, a spoilt rotten fan base, and the nearly comical repetition of hiring a coach, having him bring in players, not win the league the first year, blame the coach and the players, then fire the coach, and repeat. Do you guys know how mad Bayern fans were when it was decided that De Ligt had to leave to join Man United? There was a petition to let him stay with several ten thousands of participants....  Dunno. De Ligt was until 1.5 years ago Bayerns best and most reliable defender Then he got injured several times and that shitshow season under Tuchel happened... De Ligt is not a playmaker CB but was very strong physically and brought a lot of energy, communication and leadership to the table. Especially in big games with Bayern.  I feel like after the shitty last year for him, Manchester United is not the best place right now to build back your confidence and to find your best form again... ""Is my club weak and a graveyard for talented players? No, its literally hundreds of players over the last 10 years that have all been bad""  Get a grip united, the list of fantastic players that have flopped or not thrived there is too big to keep putting the blame on them. United is a shit show right now and what these bullshit pundits deserved would be for all the talent to fucking leave this burning house Every player that comes to Utd lately is worse. Why is that? I think Scholes remembers how much he and fellow United players loathed the press and their opinions, but it would get players riled up and motivated to perform.   He’s just playing his part. Hahaha. De Ligt has been there for like what, three months? Give him time to adapt to United’s tactics before judging him, for heaven’s sake. I feel like with strikers you’d give them a season to ‘adjust to the premier league’ but a centre back needs to perform instantly. Give him some time I think he’s a very good defender De Ligt and Yoro came in for Maguire and Lindelof. They are younger and more talented, but neither are top class at the moment so there's a bedding in process.  Maguire isn't the future at CB and he's down to his last contracted year. Overall, De Ligt is an upgrade over Maguire. Paul Scholes knows more about football than I ever will but he's not perfect. This take is incorrect.   Harry Maguire is very capable but limited. De Ligt offers a whole lot more.  Scholes spent his entire career at one club and never experienced the disruption of a move. MDL has played just 7 matches for a new club, with a new manager and new teammates in a new country and, to my eyes, so far has looked pretty good  I'm not offering this view out of blind devotion to player, club or manager, but I find the vast majority of Scholes recent output is negative. I loved him as a player and I realise I loved him more before he started talking in public How is this controversial? De ligt is literally the dutch maguire, slow as heck and gets rinsed by technical players. No big difference? It's a clear downgrade even. De Ligt failed twice in major leagues and still has this enormous value hanging over his head. If he wasn't  Dutch he'd be a benchwarmer in Polish league at best.  And this will be downvoted by Dutch fanboys and Manchester delulus, but pay attention to his play next game. Nervous, bad passing, reckless challenges and totally not leadership material.  Stop seeing him as a 55M worth 25 year old ""wonderkid"" but as a struggling 5M technically limited centreback and he makes more sense as to why he's failing. I feel so vindicated right now after reading all the bayern fan comments shitting on Upamecano and Kim and calling our board stupid for selling him. Reddit hivemind was unreal with him. ""Our best defender"" my ass, for 70mil you'd expect prime Virgil Van Dijk. As a United fan who's watched every game this season, it's clear to see that De Ligt is better than maguire.Scholes obviously hasn't watched every game. Scholes is not a very smart man, is he? I mean we knew that already after the feet incident… Have any of these ex-Utd players ever mentioned that the club might be the problem?  Having a few dud signings is to be expected for any team, but almost everyone Utd bring in seems to be some sort of failure. There's clearly something absolutely rotten with the coaching there. De Ligt is a far better player than Maguire. Unfuckingreal take lol When you get pundits in you expect them to be a lot better than who you’ve already got. Scholes has come in for Le Tissier, let’s say, but there’s no big difference there.  De Ligt is a massive upgrade on Maguire in the areas that United need in a defender with how they want to play. He is more mobile, quicker, calmer, better on the ball and more of a goal threat. The fella has been there for 5 games. It took Vidic half a season to settle in at United and look at how that turned out  And that is before you even get to the fact that De Ligt is not a replacement for Maguire. He is a replacement for Varane/Lindelof/Evans  Ex players should know that it can take time to bed in at a new team and work out how to play in a new league. Well Scholes didn't because he only played for United, and United in their prime at that so never knew any other way. With that in mind maybe he should consider shutting the fuck up every now and then the worst person you know has just made a decent point This is an unbelievable take, if you genuinely think this then I don't know why any of us are bothering any more Riveting stuff Please play Maguire more and keep Ten Hag I am surprised there are still players willingly signing for Manchester United.   A place that has been a graveyard for talent for a decade now, a club that signs to destroy where careers go to die. I said this before the season started, but seeing that Scholes has the same opinion made me realize im wrong Just a relevant reminder that Paul Scholes sucks his daughters toes. Managers is meant to buy players that suit the play style. If they don't, that is the managers fault.  ETH really hasn't got the most out of any players in the years he has been there. Bayern and Juventus are no fools. He is just Maguire 2 Again let me reiterate, bar some bizarre situations like falling out with the club(Aubameyang), or, maybe they have won everything and want to try new club, any so called TOP player that was released SO EASILY by a big club is a huge red flag. De Ligt fails at multiple big clubs before, its just doesnt make sense all the big clubs do not want him. Just reverse the situation and say, would Man Utd sell Bruno easily? No. Not said they wont be sold, but with stupidly high money they will.   This also same with Ugarte. The fans already realised that its not a good idea to buy a player that was just signed and was pushed out so easily.   Most club, well maybe bar Chelsea and Man Utd, would carefully spend and sometimes not spending is better than spend ie Liverpool [deleted] Hardly anyone Man Utd have bought in the last decade has looked good compared to their reputation. My unpopular opinion is that De Ligt has never been *that* special. Surely, he was one of the best U20 defenders we've seen with Ajax, but since then he has been benched at Juve, Bayern and his NT. He is a decent defender and very physical, but lacks the mobility and ball playing ability required for a modern center back. It’s only been a handful of games to be fair. I was more surprised to see him and Martinez so poorly positioned or with bad positional discipline. De Ligt is not the fastest and he was way up the pitch at times.  I guess part of this is being down to 10 men and part is the dysfunctional system and tactics. Utd had no midfield as far as I could tell.  I  expected Utd to be compact, play with positional discipline and hurt us in transition. I think De Ligt would be great at that, and he’s a good passer too.  But they were all over the place, hence he was too. This is why I believe that big teams in Italy, Spain and Germany need to look for some of these players that are not getting playing time in underperforming English teams and give them a new chance. Unfortunately English teams sign players for the sake of signing them and to look for the next shiny thing. I'm pretty sure guys like Maguire, Lindelof, Antony and a few other from Chelsea would do well somewhere else. Funny thing is how the English players are viewed it's either top class or dog water no in between for players at the so called big clubs so De Ligt will get slack but if maguire was playing during the 3-0 maybe 90% would be his fault Lmao I seen him say before the Twente game that he thought Maguire would have dealt with teams and players as well as De Ligt has done so far this season. Which is a strange opinion because Maguire had two or three seasons of ridicule from making mistakes and struggling against those same players and costing them points regularly. So glad that bald fraud didnt manage to get his hand on Jarrad The biggest problem for maguire is that when he runs he looks like he has crapped himself.  Visually it looks like he is not a great athlete but the fact he keeps getting games shows that the stats are better than the eye. Maguire just looks goofy doing the same shit the other defenders do, so he gets focus.  The team defense is a total mess so those defenders get put in a lot of shit situations, a lot of opportunity to make big individual errors with no cover, cause shit team defense. The coach plays a big factor in how defenders play, is De Ligt a top defender? Yes. He delivered against PSG, against Arsenal, against Real Madrid, in different systems whether definding high or in a low block.   Kim Min Jae and Upamecano was regarded as bad defenders by Bayern fans (although I disagree), under Kompany they are delivering brilliant performances. Defending is a 11 man job. You can't expect your defenders to perform when a couple of passes gets any team to your danger areas like I've seen against Tottenham.   Man United needs a proper coach, or for ETH to break this toxic cycle and start a fresh start with his team internally and let results speak for themselves. Huh, well as someone that watches us every game, it's been a pretty obvious upgrade from Maguire. And that's hardly just my opinion, I don't think I've actually heard a single Utd fan say he isn't. Maguire isn't a bad player, but it's super obvious that he doesn't like playing out and he doesn't like holding a high line. Two things De Ligt has specifically shined at for us. We're totally a mess obviously, and Saturday was a joke. But overall, there are extremely clear differences in how we've played this season to last. Rarely seen de ligt have a decent game for the last 4 years At Juventus failed IMHO, last year was at Bayern and they miss the title.. very overvalued player I was highly skeptical given that Juve and Bayern both seemed thrilled to offload him pretty soon after acquiring him. I think he's looked decent but just not the presence United have needed in the back yet. I always feel Maguire looks a bit clunky on the ball which De Light is definitely an improvement on. Only people who hype De Ligt are football manager players. There’s a reason no good team came in for him. It sounds like De Ligt isn't going to get any slack either.   Scholes won't shut up about him. De ligt needs someone like rudiger to cover for him and that’s where yoro comes in but got injured If he was any good, Bayern would have kept him How long till people finally stop making excuses for De ligt ? De light was MOTM in his first start, what the fuck are you talking about. He’s been solid. I feel like I'm going insane seeing everyone pretend they always rated maguire It's stupid criticism regardless. United didn't have fit defenders at times last season and were playing Casemiro+Evans at CB. They couldn't splash money on one top CB, they had to get a couple solid defenders and a DM. They got 3 starters and a talented young CB for well under 200m which was seen as good business not long ago. Scholes was spouting this before De Ligt had even signed.   You’d have to know who he rates over Maguire to put any value in this statement anyway. Can’t be doing with people who love to point out problems but when you ask them for a solution they say nothing.   Scholes was one of the greatest players in United’s history, but he’s also a right daft twat. The fanbase has already imploded, the media may as well pile on even more than usual De Ligt has failed to live up to the hype at two consecutive clubs following his Ajax departure while Maguire has been decent to very good for a hugely inconsistent United side in that period  Which players actually came to Man United and improved there the last 10 years? I really struggle to think of anyone. But plenty have left and gone on to do well somewhere else.   It happens occationally at every club of course as not every signing will turn out well. But Man United really is a baffling case. How can a club fail so miserably on almost *all* their signings? There has to be something in the water there. They have also been in a bad habit of buying players that are good, but identified as surplus to requirements at the selling clubs.  Varane, Casemiro, Mount, Pogba, Matić, Ronaldo, and now de Ligt, are all very good players. But -- United needs to start asking themselves why the selling clubs never seem to bothered of letting these big profile players go? Completely agree- no one can thrive in this ridiculous environment and mediocre tactical setup  ManU players are under immense pressure, but also get little help from their manager tactically  Especially midfielders and defenders. Every time Tottenham was in ManU's half, you could see how uncoordinated they were. 4 defenders in 4 different defensive lines, De Ligt or Lisandro closing down 40 yards upfield while the other CB is in his own penalty area... They are all playing on their own.  Madness and impossible not to look silly defensively.  Look at this:  https://imgur.com/a/VM6saK3  De Ligt at halfway line, only 2 ManU defenders behind the ball, Ugarte not in sight... Whenever i dee mctominay highlight with napoli, i feel so happy that he moved. I hope he will come back to PL one day Could the same argument not also be applied to Maguire's collapse in form? Maguire is aerially still one of the best centre backs around, both offensively and defensively, there's usually very little to worry about if he's competing for crosses and set pieces      >De Ligt can improve though.  Think most of the United team will improve when ten hag is gone Maguire was never a bad player  He was nothing more than a scapegoat for a struggling team  Just like when they mocked McFred I agree that De Ligt hasn't been a massive upgrade, but it says more about Maguire than anything really. He's been stellar and even won PL POTM last season as a CB. Imagine having Maguire in the squad and think you can contend for euro cups 😂😂😂 To be fair half the Sancho assists are him making 5 yard passes and then someone dribbling past 4 players before scoring that’s the problem with Man United, always finding scapegoats when it’s clearly the system He also spent his entire career ducking the media, then he realised he could secure the bag by chatting shit about United. So now he won't shut up. I think what he's said here is probably true though? Maguire looked decent last season. De Ligt hasn't looked any better than that so far. Lol and what do you know 😂 But you do, right? Agreed but he’s correct here  Reddit is proof that some random donut think they understand football better than a former great No, but the 1000s of commenters everyday in r/soccer get everything correct. Punditry in general now has nothing to do with insights or knowledge of the game. It's just trying to get engagement. Almost every sentence and interaction is just essentially a social media post where the more engagement it gets the more likely they are to be called back. You can say that for a lot of players-turn-pundits. Right now it’s the former United ones that are showing their arses the most though. Scholes and Rio are both thick as fuck. How do you feel about Carragher calling out De Ligt's mistakes in this video?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76isXbybbvA You can add Rio and Neville to that list. All 3 are bellends So he is the English Didi Hamann? \[Lothar Matthäus entered the chat\] Which is why the 'I swear most of r/soccer have never played competetive and it shows bla bla' comments always make me laugh  First of all the insecurity oozes from it, and having played competitively doesn't make youre opinion right Absolute state of you. Or maybe he has insight we don't after living and breathing football his entire life. Don't you know that Kobbie Mainoo is the second coming of Jesus Christ? I don't think he's a fan of watching his team concede three goals at home to an average spurs side without their best player  Im sorry for posting this multiple times in this thread but you are correct and here's a world class example of the issue you bring up. From the Tottenham game:  https://imgur.com/a/VM6saK3  You can point out like 6 different tactical/organizational issues instantly.  De Ligt at the halfline because he was closing someone down way up there... Ugarte? Not in sight. Mainoo miles behind his opponent. Shaw also behind. Only 2 defenders behind the ball, meaning those 2 have to worry about 4 Tottenham players...  This team is just chaos. High fullbacks? Only 1 full back goes high whilr the other one tucks into midfield to shield the defence. Atleast watch some games before criticizing the tactics. These days I think it's a FIFA thing - career mode has players constantly improving, you get big jumps year to year in Ultimate Team, I wouldn't be surprised if people think a player could just make that jump (rather think EA probably got one of those numbers wrong) De Ligt has been well received by most fans and pundits. Scholes is an exception, He hasn't been massacred at all. He's been one of the good parts of the team.  Unfortunately, if you play for Utd, it doesn't matter how you perform, everyone will shit on you for engagement.  It's easy money He's been good dont worry. Pundits and fans of other teams are just dying to call every united player shit at any opportunity. Mazraoui has been great as well. I don't think he was ever our best CB he was benched at Juve, Bayern, Manu and NT  might be the player That's because Maguire is also pretty good (under Ole was hailed as a good signing, we just overpaid), and under Ten Hag everyone looks a bit shit. De Ligt's probably better, but both are very good is the point I think, and neither can show it. No need to disrespect Maguire It’s Paul Scholes..   Reasonable people can see that he’s a clear upgrade on Maguire, the team is just so bad lately that any player on the pitch gets dragged down a level or two. de Ligt has been just elite every time I've seen him at Juve and Bayern. I don't undertand why he keeps moving clubs. Honestly, what CB is better and younger than him? Maybe you could argue Saliba but thats all I can see.   He really isn't weak in any area. He can play the ball under pressure, he is fast enough for everyone except the Mbappes of the world, he is strong and tall enough to mark any striker, he can do anything you want from a CB. Man Utd and ruining players, name a better duo The thing about De Ligt is that we’ve been wondering for several years now when he’ll take the next step. But he just doesn’t take it. At least not as big as was once expected of him.  The fact that he doesn’t have a regular place at either Bayern or the Netherlands says a lot. At Bayern, he was only a regular in central defense with Dier towards the end of the season. Even then he was outshone by Dier.  I agree with you. Reddit overrates him enormously. Basically he’s an above average defender without modern playmaking qualities. 45m euros isn’t catastrophic but he shouldn’t be expected to transform Utd‘s defense. He didn’t fail to nail down a starting spot at Bayern. He had injury issues for the first half of last season then was the starting CB with Dier after Christmas. > potential  He's 25 with 331 senior appearances last time De Ligt reached his ""peak"" was in 2019, and how much potential can you squeeze out of a 25yo? Too many online United fans equate accurate criticism with being a muppet. You’re the muppet. All our signings in the last few years without exception have been bad deals for one reason or another. Some more obviously were ever gonna work (like Mount) and some were just squad rotation players signed for first XI prices (Ugarte, Hojlund, Zirkzeee the list goes on).  None of these current guys will ever produce good numbers for us in the PL, they’re not that level. We lack actually elite, top players that our guys can support.   We have a full squad of squad players This is something I said the other day, Utd are spending big on other teams reserves from teams they should be competing versus. De Ligt wasn't a second option...he's their starting CB and Bayern fans were actually against him leaving.   Plus we got him for very cheap considering his age and quality. *""Needless to say, I had the last laugh.""* what do you mean Zirkzee works quite well in this side with the whole front three? The biggest problems is that he has Bruno behind him which doesnt fit his style. Even so a lot of attacks go through him and if he was more clinical he would have a couple of more goals Did you just say halfbacks? Fucksake When I say this in our sub I get hammered. I have called out every bad transfer but especially the ones where people were disproportionately hyped (Our summer signings this and last season especially).   Our fans don’t understand that we’ve signed unsuitable players who aren’t particularly special (def not top 4 quality) for huge fees and they wonder why we keep failing. When we’re the only ones in for someone and their clubs willingly sell them to us we’re not getting a good deal…we’re being conned more or less. Real, PSG and Bayern all knew this and so do others. De Ligt is not that good. And has not been that good since 2019 What have you seen that says he's a clear upgrade over Maguire? Did you not watch Dier go to Bayern and play alongside him, with Dier often times being the better of the two? You'd have to say Dier is 2x the player that Maguire is to make it make sense.  I think most haven't seen De Ligt play since Ajax, and still think he's an elite CB. Truth is he's good, but he's not that guy. what is De Ligt better at than Maguire? CR7 scored 18 in his first prem season back, Varane was injured half the time but otherwise played well when he was fit for a run of games, Casemiro was one of if not our best player in his first season for us and has since lost his legs. What are you talking about? Do you even watch any United games? Varane was still quality, when he was fit. Casemiro and Ronaldo's first seasons were respectively stellar. Lol Pogba was miles ahead of every player for united in the last 10 years he was just moody and very spoiled I'm convinced that while they could all execute well, their understanding of the game is more innate and none of them (that have ended up in punditry) ever took the time to really study the game beyond their role. Like they all played to their instructions and added in individual flair, but none of the ones we hear from regularly actually stepped back to understand the whole of the game beyond their position. Even Gary Neville sounds good when he talks about one on one defending, but I don't think any of them think about the teamwide tactics.   Either that, or my other theory is that the TV directors/production staff is telling them to keep it simple, since you don't really get any good analysis on TV. It's all in print (like the Athletic) or youtube (like Tifo and a bunch of dudes who just cover their own team), and these guys are happy to keep it simple and cash in the fat paycheck. How many players who spent any length of time in the premier league have gone on to be successful managers? [deleted] The 24-hour news cycle is so boring at this point. They always have to manufacture a news story everyday to get people outraged and upset. Didn't De Ligt played in Ten Hag famous Ajax team back then? What tactics? 🥲🤣🤣 it's not De Ligt, it's united, the talent killing club. VdV was bossing for spurs from the first game,why does De Ligt with more experience get more slack? Hes just poor Maguire is definitely starting to show all those miles he has in the tank.  He's not old for a CB. But he has played ridiculous amounts. Broke a consecutive appearance record for united and I believe played every minute for Leicester one season too. He didn't fail at Bayern. He was our best defender, and the fan base was pretty upset that they were pushing him out the door, but the club was adamant about having to sell some of the high earners and he was pretty much the only one who had any kind of market. Just had a glass of water, really refreshing, honestly feels good to be hydrated, you should try that Have you ever actually watched him play or do you just watch twitter highlights? This is Serie A and Bundesliga winning centre half, Matias De Ligt you are talking about right? What an awful take. De Ligt is a better football player than Maguire. But if the question is ""does de Ligt perform better than Maguire at Man United so far?"", then the answer is no. Maguire actually was pretty decent the last half of last season, despite all his previous meme generating performances. And de Ligt has not been an instant upgrade so far.   Will he improve? I would think so. But I can't really remember any games so far this season where he stood out and improved Man United defensively more than Maguire did. Some can be attributed to Ten Hags terrible tactics and gaping holes in the midfield. But those existed when Maguire played as well. And you should still expect to see a difference in quality between two players despite bad tactics, if one player actually is significantly better than the other. WE SHOULD ALL THINK THE SAME! If you’re spending that much I’d say it is. I don't think he understands much at all about the game, for a player of his quality. It's why there's a generation of Spanish coaches dominating management whilst the English lads were flushed really fast. Probably Bruno Fernandez is the only one I can think of who has done well. Good managers improve players and make them look better than they are, Wijnaldum looked world class under Klopp for example. Bad managers make players look worse than they are. Almost like players need a functioning team and system to look good Old Trafford is where careers go to die. Casemiro, but just one season. For the last 10 years or so Man Utd seem to actively make players worse with the possible exception of when Ole was the manager. True. but then again anyone who has left United has also not looked good compared to their form at United. He’s another one that peaked early and everyone assumed he would get continue on an upward trajectory from there.  It's like he shot straight to that level and has just stayed their since. It was incredibly impressive for someone his age at the time to play like that, but now it's not that impressive and he's not really gotten any better despite his experience. It’s also because our NT is stacked in defense. Apart from De Ligt we have Van Dijk, De Vrij, Timber, ake, van de Ven, Geertruida (not including backs like Dumfries and Frimpong). So even if De Ligt was performing well, it’s hard to outperform those players. It's this. The mental gymnastics in this thread making out that he's a top player cursed by the Man United gene are compelling but a bit of a stretch really. It's not a coincidence his arrival at Juve and then Bayern coincided with both of their mammoth streaks ending: he's simply not the very top quality demanded of a super club. I mean van de Ven also is benched for that National team Eric Dier walked into the Bayern side last year and was immediately their best CB. I've always rated Dier more than most and he just wasn't a fit for our system anymore but that was very telling to me.   Idk I obviously haven't watched him as much as fans of the clubs he's played for but he hasn't impressed me after Ajax. I thought it was weird how distraught Bayern fans were at losing him based on what I'd seen and now at United he hasn't changed my opinion at all. I would definitely take Maguire over him Last part is certainly true, but I feel like his experience at that age and also his leadership & character actually are quite special. Very rare to find that in someone who’s just 24 (or just turned 25). He was benched at Bayern only by Tuchel. Nagelsmann rated him and the fans loved him so much they signed a massive petition to keep him. People are still pissed at his sale. So I think there are many sides to it. Back then, I was a bit disappointed with our club for choosing Militao over him. Like a lot of other times, the board again proved me wrong. Militao hasn't been flawless, but I'm definitely relieved the club went for him instead of De Ligt. That whole Ajax generation didn't reach the expected heights  This is true and its typical for united to not fucking catch up and change their minds based on reality but then he was special no? Probably the best defender i've seen in the Eredivisie and definitely the most talented and in recent years there have been quite a lot of talented defenders in the league. Only Vertonghen was on the same level imo in his last season and he was 24 at the time.  Feels though ever since he left Ajax he lost mobility and a form of graciousness he had prior. He seems to be more rash in his actions ever sicne De Ligt was not benched by Juve. He missed some games due to a dislocated shoulder. But he was a starter during his three seasons at the club. One factor that could’ve hurt him is that he bulked up too much at Juve, which led him to lose pace. He’s one of the fastest CBs around, no idea what you’re talking about there. Ball playing sure De Ligt got this reputation of a great passer probably because he came from ajax but he has never been more than an okay passer of the ball. He made bringing the ball out for Bayern very difficult because opponents knew he would fold when pressed. >Utd had no midfield as far as I could tell.  Yep, it's this. It's the reason every centre back who plays for United seems to repeatedly get caught out of position. It's happening because there's little structure in front of them.  Even at the Sunday league level I've played at, I know how thankless it is being a centre back with a poor midfield in front of you. If you sit deep the opposition midfield and attackers have loads of space and it's easy for them to make passes and take shots, but if you push up into that space you get caught in behind.  It doesn't matter how good you are as a centre back, it's *really* hard not to get caught out of position if you're behind a dysfunctional midfield. And United's midfield is absolutely dysfunctional. Agreed, Uniteds style of play really doesn’t help their CBs, exposes them to a lot especially when they try and play a high line with relatively slow defenders. I feel like we're reaching the point where conversations need to be had about Martínez.    If Maguire did even half of the shit that he does on a regular basis, he'd be getting unreal slander in the press, yet Martínez escapes criticism all the time.     Lunges into challenges when staying on his feet is a far better choice; gets dragged out of position very easily and gets spun far too often. > and he’s a good passer too  He’s never been a good passer, why on earth do people think that Their games together give the impression that neither of them is sure when to step up, or hold off. Look at first goal conceded v Liverpool for example. De Light is not a good passer. If you watched him at Bayern you'll know this. Guy will always panic with the ball on his feet when being pressed. The reason why Tuchel played Dier alongside him instead of Kim and Upamecano who are also not good passers (Kim is actually good passer but last season his confidence was low every time he played it was disaster). This won't happen as long as there is a ""Premier League tax"". Why pay for a PL player when you can get two or three players of the same quality for the same price.  It only makes sense to look at PL when they *need* to get rid of players e.g. Sancho and Greenwood. Are you Moshiri? Issue is more that *certain* English teams just pay ridiculous amounts, that inflates English wages in general and makes it difficult for players to justify moving on.  Sure Antony and Maguire would do well elsewhere.  But they are on superstar wages you'd expect only of the very best players at big clubs like Arsenal, Liverpool, Madrid or Bayern.  You can't blame them for securing the future of their families by not taking a pay cut even if it means waiting out the contract in mid table, and you can't expect other clubs to want to break their pay structure to take them on either. No way about Antony. Just pay close attention to how he plays in a couple of matches and you'll see he barely looks like a PL level footballer at times. If he goes to Milan or something he's going to be another Origi. He should go the Victor Moses route and convert to WB. Antony is useless.  He could maybe function in MLS or something. No pace, can’t cross, can’t get shots on target, can’t keep possession. It's the contracts which are the issue. Most of these players aren't going to take a pay cut to move, even if it would help their careers in the long-run because they're getting paid more than they could hope to earn elsewhere even if they start playing really well.  When they run their contracts down, maybe you can take them as a free agent, but by that time they've spent a significant chunk of time not playing and it's probably lost them their edge. I think many teams outside England would love to sign Harry Maguire. But he’s paid around 200k a week no? He’s good but he’s not that good. Neither is De Ligt by the way. Only a club like PSG Real Barca Atleti could sign such a player. Maguire isn’t quite that level imo. The teams that would want him, he’s paid 2-3x their typical salary for a starting CB. So ofc they will not even try to sign him. I personally think Maguire would do very well in a team who aren’t necessarily the best in their league but who are competing for trophies/qualifying for Europe each year. I personally think Maguire would do very well in a team who aren’t necessarily the best in their league but who are competing for trophies/qualifying for Europe each year. What Im reading from everything on this post suggests to me Maguire should have left United and revived his career years ago. Basically the same athleticism criticism of Sancho minus the professionalism issue and Sancho got better the second he left Manchester. I know its not always that simple, but if Maguire was fit into a defensive team he’d look like the player United bought for £80 million (jesus christ that fee) Just to point out that your comment makes sense but contains an assumption.  Could also be that the manager is a fuckwit who picks his pets.  I don't think Ten Hag is that stupid, but I can't see any evidence that he isn't. He was arguably Bayerns best cb, they just have 3 other high quality, highly paid cbs His first start was a 3-0 loss to Liverpool. Didn’t he concede 3 to Liverpool in his first start? Solid Defending Maguire is en vogue right now. From the same subreddit that will upvote him slipping over in a match to be the top post that week filled with comments like ""Lord Slabhead"".   But it's not even defending Maguire, it's just using it to say De Ligt is shite.   Makes me laugh sometimes.   Maguire is a good defender, always had been. He isn't some world class Rolls Royce defender.   De Ligt is a good defender. He isn't some world class Rolls Royce defender.   To this subreddit, you're either one of the best players in your position, or you're absolutely shite. Wait til he makes one defensive error then all the people will be back saying he’s a bum that should’ve never put on a United shirt. I have so it’s to see some praise for him; not at the expense of De Ligt tho. I have always rated him and still rate him. He's a good defender  When things are shit, the player on the bench always appears so much better. Hands down, Maguire plays instead of De Ligt and we're worse. De Ligt isn't a legendary elite CB, but he's an upgrade for a fair price. Dude it's always like that for Utd players. Whatever narrative to make the club look worse. In this case, over spending on a cb that's no better than one we have. Which is just false. He's absolutely shown some real quality in particular area's that Maguire was lacking in.   Maguire is and always has been a solid cb, but he's terrible at passing out. Terrible. He never places the ball right for the person he's passing to, it's almost always undercooked. He also regularly chooses to pass the ball to someone that's being covered by multiple people, forcing them to just pass back and him to then pass back to Onana and this particular pattern has played us into trouble and directly cost us several goals in recent seasons. He also finally does not like to hold a high line because he's got no acceleration and gets beat every time.   In the short time we've had MDL he's shown he's a crisp passer of the ball that plays quite high and he's made some recovery runs that really surprised me, since everyone was talking about how slow he was when he signed. If Yoro was fully fit this discussion wouldn’t even happen. He would obvs be starting. I know he’s a kid but they paid 70 mil and prioritized him over any other signing. De Ligt was a squad signing basically - esp with a view to Evans, Maguire and Lindelof likely all being gone by next season. Lets not forget him sucking his daughter toes and posting picture of it online Idk. I thought he was last year, but everything he’s been saying is spot on. He’s been critical of how we’ve looked in the midfield, even after big wins. Bayern fans had a petition to stop him from being sold No he hasn't. Solid at Juventus and Bayern fans even on this thread are speaking highly of him. This sub and constantly spreading false information. De ligt performed very well at both Juve and Bayern, so well at Bayern that fans made a petition begging him to stay. While Maguire has had a very mediocre career at United, with a constant stream of mistakes with ok performances here and there. Bruno was the one I was thinking of when I wrote that, even if his form has been poor lately he’s still been a fantastic signing for them in fairness. But yeah I agree with you, the club is toxic from top to bottom I honestly can’t understand why players still make the conscious decision to go there. The only reasons are money & because of the pedigree the club has, but surely you’d be put off by seeing almost every player fail there and set their careers back > But plenty have left and gone on to do well somewhere else.  Like who?  A few of them go on to have decent careers like Herrera, Blind or Lukaku, but there's nobody who's left United who any elite sides would want as key players except Di Maria.    United's problem has been bringing in players who aren't elite level. You could make a case that Bruno is doing well, but yeah, almost every player that goes there regresses. Some players come, have a decent 6 months to a year, and then fizzle away. Bruno F for one. and then B Fernandes too Fergie made a deal with the devil to win his last league title. Hey I know it sounds crazy but when all rational explanations fail, you have to start looking at witchcraft. I would say bruno and maybe maybe zlatan.  You could add in mainoo and garnacho potentially into that list but you're right almost all the players who came to united have seen their career trajectory go to another direction. [deleted] He has a lot of potential offensively and he is a threat but he has rarely proven to be efficient on set pieces. Ole was miles better than this guy. United looked deadly at times. Even mourinho. Maguire is one of the most disrespected players I've seen in a long time, some United fans act like he's one of the worst defenders to ever play the game, it's ridiculous And look how those two are thriving now, McTominay especially. I agree that he was scapegoated often, but nah never a bad player is pushing it and sounds like revisionism. He had 2 years of being sub par in his United stint.  Fred was a 50 50 player. Either he was good or bad.  McTominay is not a good cdm, but decent box to box.  The were scapedgoated often, but they were also bad often. He was pretty bad I want to make it clear that Maguire isn't a bad player, but he still can't pass out from the back to save his life. And McFred, again, two decent players. But playing decent in Turkey or Italy isn't the same thing. I hope McTominay is an absolute baller for the rest of his career, but in red, he very frequently would make an effort to hide from the ball. And then, McFred is gone and United fans would glad take back at least McTominay Maguire made a lot of mistakes and mcfred weren't technical enough for a modern midfield Maguire is absolutely class. The way he got attacked was so harsh because it showed a lack of understanding of the game from fans bashing him, as a lot of ""mistakes"" were just due to him not having adequate midfield cover. He was having to do way too much. He was having to decide between marking attackers whilst also deciding should he be pressing higher as we had nobody doing that or if we did the mistake happened already in midfield for the chance to develop But then we boot out the manager in charge of the system and nothing improves. To me it feels like a problem that either can't be fixed or will take a long time to turn around. I Just feel like ten Hag will get sacked and the cycle will just start again Probably just trying to say the wildest shit possible in the hope people eventually forget he chews on his daughters toenails [deleted] He’s also implying that with the right coaching and tactics you probably have a player in Maguire that can be of the same level as De Ligt.  I mean beyond that though Maguire is 31 and De Ligt is 25 so I’m not sure why he would be questioning the reasoning behind the transfer and why it makes sense for De Ligt to be here. De light is new to EPL. He shoud be given some time to adjust. Not really, i mean there's clearly a difference between their strengths and weaknesses right.  I think you are going to have a hard time finding someone that's better at doing Maguire things than Maguire, especially in the pool of people in that price range that would want to come to United.  These signings are obviously to replace players with players that are better at specific things and to hopefully have a better overall team as a result.  Same for AWB, hard to believe Scholes does not get that not every signing is going to be better at everything than their predecessor. We are glossing over his premise, and I don't agree with it. Whether you have to expect new players to be better than what you've got depends entirely on the situation.   That premise skews the discussion. Is De Ligt an upgrade to Mcguire? Is De Ligt good for this situation? Was Mcguire bad? What is the topic?  EDIT: I can even see that all he's really saying is that ""I just want Man United to be better and this guy didn't fix things"". It just seems like emotion draped in haphazard arguments. I think the more baffling thing is why people rated De Ligt *that* highly in the first place. It was like they hadn't seen him play since Ajax acting like he was some world class defender I disagree and also this part isn't true as well  >When you bring players in, you expect them to be a lot better than who you’ve already got.When you bring players in, you expect them to be a lot better than who you’ve already got.  This is just not true But what if two greats have totally different opinions on the same subject? For real Playing a sport and analysing it are completely different skill sets though. A lot of former ex players have terrible takes, now that could be that they are just bad at communicating. I mean, there are bloggers that have a great understanding of the game and some even manage to get jobs because of it and there many great players that have limited understanding.  Just because you were great at playing a game it doesn't mean you understand it well. Many all-time greats are idiots when it comes to football. They play the game but don't really study it No he does not enter the chat - Lothar is a fantastic pundit compared to most others  Matthäus is the best we have in Germany tbh, everyone else is boring Playing competitively doesn’t make your opinion automatically correct but if you haven’t played football at any competitive level, then you will miss certain things. If you listen to people like him and Ferdinand, they clearly don’t and just say rage-baiting things to keep attention I'm shocked by the reaction on this post. From what I've seen bar Spurs de ligts been your best player this season. I swear, no other big player gets this baby treatment outside of De Ligt. Juve didn't cry over losing him, Bayern got rid of him, and now he's not setting the world alight at United. Not to mention he's a bench-warmer in the Dutch national team.   He's been one of the highest paid centrebacks in the last five years and doesn't have a whole lot to show for it. Onana, De Ligt, and Mazraoui are probably our best performers so far this season. Zirkzee has impressed me as well he started in UCL knockout matches after the 1-0 loss against Lazio and has been class, most people forget he was pretty much starting alongside Dier the second half of the season  I will not take this De Ligt slander there’s a reason why over 70,000 fans wanted him to stay lmao The part about him not being a starter at Bayern is kinda BS. His first season he was our best defender. Then the next season he was injured at the beginning of the season and Kim and Upa were starters. Then Upa and Kim sucked together so de Ligt played his way back into the team and was once again the starter when healthy. I love how confidently people on this sub will say incorrect things Most centre backs don't start hitting their peak until their mid/late 20s. I think because De Ligt burst on the scene at such a young age people hold him to an unfair expectation.   At his age, Van Dijk had only just gone to Southampton from Celtic, and was 2 years older than De Ligt is now before he went to Liverpool. I’m not implying he will reach his peak again, but he peaked at a very high level around the age of 19/20, the fact he fell off at 25y/o doesn’t mean he can never reach that peak again.  Look at a VVD for example who started to break trough at this age So lets say he is right and that he is in fact not an upgrade, why does it have to be when we needed _depth_ for years and how can you now criticise De Ligt coming in for a bargain in todays market, at a great age, which furthers strengthens our depth? This is 100% muppetry even when you consider what he said as a fact > We lack actually elite, top players that our guys can support.  Which ones? How do you entice them to join United?   Were Sanchez, Ronaldo, Sancho, Casemiro not elite top players at the time? We've tried it, mate, it doesn't really work that way. Idk imo it doesn't seem like the squad has gotten any better since before Ten Hag took over.   It shocked me when I saw recent spending totals to see that the baldy pushed United's 10-season spending total over £2bn after he somehow ran through £600m with not much to show. For comparison Liverpool's 10-season spending total is roughly £750m.  I know market values are exponential by curve by just some food for thought, FC Twente's squad value is £68m lmao. De Ligt was Bayern's finest centrebacks, as most fans would agree    Mazraoui cost us less than 20m and has looked as a RB with the quality of a regular starter    Ugarte didn't exactly fit in at PSG so calling him a 3rd choice DM is not genuine    With regards to Yoro and Zirkzee, I agree with you Bayern fans may rate him but the hierarchy did not. He wasn't exactly a starting CB by the end and they were clearly pushing him out. He has a worse injury record than both of your existing CBs and Bayern fans wanted to keep him while the coach wanted nothing to do with him.  Bayern is currently undefeated and look bulletproof on defense. Go ahead and ask any Bayern fans if they will trade De Ligt for Min-jae or Upamecano lol.  You're club paid the same price for him as Arsenal paid for Calafiori. Horrible business if you ask me. De Ligt is great at many aspects of defending and was very good defender at Bayern. Kompany and their management, however did not want him because of his flaws in ball playing and speed. Kompany chose to keep Kim over De Ligt- both are bad at playing the ball but Kim is faster.   Bayern fans are now seeing that Kompany made the correct call to not use him. Indeed I did, and it was twice as sweet because they're a local rival lmao Mate you misread. I said he doesn't fit well lol. Yes? Anchoring DMs who aim to fill out the halfspaces???  The spaces which Micky Van De Ven and the FC Twente player casually ran through???? I agree, stems from your management tbh. I thought Dan Ashworth would make a difference until he went ahead and bought Ugarte.  And don't be surprised majority of your clubs fans are very reactionairy, comes with a big fanbase ig. This sub isn't much better, but it is a massive one so expect backlash here too lmao. He's been better in every way... He is correct tho. Even if they weren't terrible, none of them consistently held their previous levels at Madrid (or Juve in Ronaldos case), they all got worse one way or another. Yeah but he was nowhere near the player he was for the french NT. My point is, United isn't a good place for player to perform at their best. Yeah like once every 5 or 6 games, and then he'd proceed to disappear for a month before putting in another good performance. Hardly worth the €100m spent on him plus his crazy wages. You might have a point there...  In comparison, we have Carragher, he had that show where he sat down with the managers and you could see that he understood tactics and has an understanding of the game. No you shouldn't infer that but you couldn't infer my original comment so I won't keep my expectations high from you. Everyone is entitled to have opinions and express them. The problem is when some ex players start making controversial statements to drive engagement as part of their highly paying media jobs. Sure did. I personally don't think he has improved much since he left Ajax. VDV came to a club with a system in place and an idea. De Ligt didn't. VDV came to a club with a system in place and an idea. De Ligt didn't. He didn’t fail at Juve either, he got sold because we had money problems and he wanted to move to a club that was doing better which is fair enough He was definetly not happy being a bench player at Bayern though,if he was good he wouldve stayed even with his big wage sadly Upamecano even with his big howlers is better Lisandro Martinez has looked good when fit. Apart from that the best player at Utd is Mainoo, from the academy. Truly woeful recruitment. He’s way outperformed his prior reputation if anything People seem to forget Ibrahimovic played for United Bruno FernandeS, portuguese names very rarely end with a Z Zlatan People like to clown him, but Maguire has been a great signing for United too. We just overpaid for him. Yeah, his introduction to Prem was simply outstanding and he did that in United. I had to respect that Eriksen, Hojlund, Varane I thought garnacho has some conviction in himself and whenever he’s on the ball I do feel something might happen. Can’t say the same about anybody else, especially rashford or zirkzee who always has a deer-caught-in-headlights look What if Bruno Fernandez is actually the GOAT bc he’s the only player that has looked decent on Man Utd The weird thing is they've changed managers multiple times, replaced every position multiple times, changed the organisation structure from a manager to more of a first team coach with a DOF, changed the DOF, now even changed the owners (or at least the effective owners given INEOS only own 25% but run the club), and nothing ever seems to get better. Like I'm genuinely stumped as to how the club can't seem to challenge for major trophies despite all the money and attempts to fix things for over a decade now. Not that I'm complaining though, it's just confusing Well, to be fair, ETH made most of the players he signed from Ajax look better than they were during their Champions League run. >Wijnaldum looked world class under Klopp for example  As a Liverpool fan, Wijnaldum is a strange example. He was a very highly rated attacking midfield prospect in Holland, full of ability and flair. At Liverpool he got turned into almost the total opposite: a watercarrier whose nose bled whenever he reached the final third. And while he was an important cog in Liverpool's workmanlile midfield, which allowed the front 3 and the fullbacks to flourish further forward, calling him 'World class' is a massive stretch. That’s radical thinking and something United overlook! Theatre of Memes. Sancho lol Depay had some good patches, he was decent at Lyon for example  Elanga is doing alright for Forest  Andreas Pereira has been decent for Fulham, even got a Brazil call up  Alexis Sanchez has been alright at times, not great but not as bad as he was at United  Angel Gomes is doing well at Nice, but they did want to keep him and he left as a young player, so doesn't really count  But yeah, not many, and even then you wouldn't say ""oh wow I can't believe United didn't keep this guy"" Sounds like a perfect United signing to me. Its also possible he had a crazy purple patch 5 years ago that he cannot repeat. Its happened to many players.  De Ligt played one absolute blinder in 2018/2019. Gets bought for huge money immediately after, without confirming that he can play at that level year-after-year  Goes to a ""bigger"" club and no longer looks as special.  Maybe his development was curtailed. Maybe he thrives in specific tactical setup.  Its also possible that 2018/2019 was an anomaly. I can name a dozen players that have looked world class in 1 season but cant sustain it (some of them also play for ManU - Rashford, Antony...). Or he’s a 24 year old CB with a ton of experience.  Lots of CB’s take a lot longer to actually hit their prime.  He’s a good player, for 50 million this was a good buy for Man U. The problem is they only invested in their D. the forward lineup and midfield is criminal for a “top team”.  I didn’t see that much of him at Ajax, only that CL run, but from those games I always felt he seemed a little bit overrated even then. He was freakishly big for a 20 year old and played with a lot of confidence, but those are things that CBs can develop over time. I didn’t see any of the technical skill, pace or elite positioning that generational CBs have - and those are much harder to develop later. i agree, he didn't improve much. he also didn't have any continuity after he left Ajax which can be very important for some positions and characters. And yet he plays at Man U and gets paid millions. I wish I was ""not that impressive"". Dark days when we’re supposed to be excited by buying the seventh choice center back for the Netherlands. Yeah, but he has been benched at both Juve and Bayern. It's not just a NT thing. We’re so turbofucked.  Feels like the only thing I can look forward to is eventually we’ll be bad for long enough it’ll stop being news.  We’re going to need to fire the manager and count on the new manager bounce to not finish 15th this year. I’m not confident we can beat anyone. Van de Ven is performing on a big stage only since last year rly, de Ligt is there since 2019  Van de Ven got minutes every game of the Euros. De Ligt was on the bench. Even last international break de Ligt would not have played if de Vrij was available. I wouldn't say Dier was their best CB. I think the only thing Dier and De Ligt were better at than Upa and Kim were their communication and simply playing more patient and trusting the world class GK behind them more. This is the thing that's easy to fix and I don't think it's coincidence that Kompany identified this as a weakness early on and their defense (including the defensive output of the midfield) has looked a lot more solid this season so far. Dier was not their best CB lmao. He had one good game and got a lot of praise for it. That's about it. World class teams will get a mobile CB with ball playing abilities over a good ""leader"" any day of the week. If De Ligt was born 15 years earlier he might have been the best CB in the world, but now... it's a different world. Mobility =/= pace Exactly, even at Juve he wasn't that good on the ball It's worth noting Maguire has been know to ping a few balls here or there when he's not being memed on for scorpion kicking Ronaldo.   The man's a seriously good passer of the ball if he's given a bit of time and space.  To back this comment up someone posted [this graph](https://x.com/datamb_/status/1839566896393310615?s=46&t=CTUIWHDCvGEG_XXCVS1bww) the other day of centrebacks and their progressive passing stats, de Ligt is shockingly low in it] at Ajax as far as I remember Schone and de Jong would always be around, there was always at minimum 1 midfielder in the triangle with the centre halves. And that was how the buildup worked and de Ligt played his part in that really well and he was really strong and coordinated in defense. But he wasn't pinging balls all over the place xabi alsonso style It seems like every pass he makes is a bouncy one. Looks like he isn’t able to make a pass that’s just gliding over the grass Yeah, to be fair I expected a lot more from De Ligt. He is not a bad defender by any means but not a top one as he was pretending to be This is a massive part of it too, their midfield organisation is horrible. Oof sounds rough.  It’s also the only way our system works because Maddison, Bentancur and Kulusevski work incredibly hard and despite looking super fluid actually have to really focus and concentrate. It’s very disciplined. And it can get caught out if there is a lapse or break in concentration. I play rec league 7s and not being able to control the midfield is still the most common way to get completely outclassed by the other team lol Getting screamed at for not closing down.  Getting screamed at for being caught out high up the pitch.  Amateur football is the worst for this as your DM is usually still stuck in the opposition half blowing out his arse Thats a major issue, along with their entire defensive organization  This is a still from the Tottenham game:  https://imgur.com/a/VM6saK3  You can point out like 6 different tactical/organizational issues instantly.  De Ligt is in the fucking midfield line because he was closing someone down way up there... Ugarte? Not in sight. Mainoo miles behind his opponent. Shaw also behind. Only 2 defenders behind the ball, meaning those 2 have to worry about 4 Tottenham players... Yeah like for the second goal the DM (Case) loses a 50/50, the left CB dives in on the half way line and misses the tackle, and the right CB has to try to match the run of Brennan Johnson. I think Dalot was pressing our FB near our area so he was completely out of the picture. So messy. I unironically think Martinez gets away with it partly because of his size. People go ”haha our little terrier” You know, Romero was pretty rash in his first couple of seasons. And under Conte it looked like he was just so pissed off about what was happening in front of him it just triggered this lack of control and discipline.  I think any player react poorly when the system or coaching is hanging you out to dry. Some may go in to their shell, others may lose discipline.  It’s taken a full season but Romero is now much calmer and less reckless. But I’m sure he is also happier with how the coaching and the system are working and is bought in.  Martinez is quality, I think we’re seeing his frustration on display. It’s like when Bruno just tries to do it all by himself. Ajax connection Yeah fair. Martinez looks to be the more natural ‘aggressor’, being very front footed and combative. You’d expect De Ligt with his lack of pace to be more of the rock at the back, but he was constantly marauding up the pitch too. Upamecano is a great passer Because I think EPL players who don't start for the big teams are usually quality players that are undervalued. Silly season is a big industry in England and fans expect their teams to participate in it even though they don't actually need new players. That is why some of these top players that were signed for big money a few years back become redudant because they need to make way for the new shiny thing. This leads to them being undervalued. Yeah. So.. 4 goals less than expected. His first game was against Fulham as a sub. They won that game, but I don't remember if he got the MoTM. Do not say hes always been good. The 2022 season he was literally the worst top defender I’ve ever seen His stupid diving in against twente and getting nowhere near the ball is what led to eriksen being in the position he was against twente.   Ugarte and de ligt have been fine but it’s cool to hate on them at the moment Is that a hartford athletic badge uou got there?? To be fair, everyone from Oldham does that. It is also very telling that players that perform for them like Bruno thrive in chaos. The amounts of times I have seen him just run after the ball leaving massive holes in the midfield is mind blowing.   Any player that would do better in some semblance of structure gets worse when they join United. It’s the money.  We’ll pay players double what they’d get anywhere else to convince them to come.  That also means that we can’t ever sell anybody because nobody in their right mind would ever pay these players the salary they’re getting.  If we don’t do that though, idk how the fuck you’d ever convince anyone to sign. AWB had an incredible first season. Maguire was also really good in the beginning, but I don't know if he necessarily improved. He at least performed to expectations.  Ole made some good signings early on. considering he also signed Bruno. Id argue bruno just has a better rep since he has been a rare good player then has improved, he's still a wierdly poor dribbler for the role he plays - McTominay is doing well in Napoli - Sancho is doing well (so far) at Chelsea - Smalling did better at Roma - Depay did well at Lyon, and ok at Barca and AM - di Maria did far better ar PSG - Welbeck has done ok - Zaha did very well  Just a quick look in addition to the ones you mentioned. I am sure I missed some. Just to be clear: it isn't unusual for players to leave a club and do better elsewhere. It happens with every club, and it isn't necessarily something negative. But when it happens at the same time as terrible recruitment it becomes an issue 😂😂 berbatov was under fergie Maguire is great at winning headers but bad at directing them This is lazy revisionism. I love Ole but he struggled and was clueless against low blocks. He also couldn't handle high intensity pressing teams, at all, especially when ronaldo joined. Finally. Yes, the wheels fell off in third season for sure, but Ole-ball was really fucking good (except for contrarian tacticians like Carl Anka/Jonathan Wilson/Kwestel). Remind me what happened when United last got a red card against Spurs? It was way worse than the last game A big part of that was his price tag, but even then, it was only because Ed was dumb enough to pay 80m for him.   80m for a defender makes people compare you to Van Dijk. I’ve never watched Maguire closely but these „Harry Maguire!!!“ compilations that made the rounds in the internet had some seriously jaw dropping stuff in them for one of the most expensive defenders off all time. Funny how the narratives changed. I've seen way more ridicule from other fans than Utd fans over the past 4 years for Maguire. He was a literal meme on this sub for like a solid year. You lot acted like he was Antony. Most of the Maguire disrespect comes from opposition fans. Well thanks for not letting us forget. Wait what?! Fucking hell I *had* forgotten about that. Justice for Slab then How did Maguire look good then? >Hard for any defender to look good  Surely the same is true for Maguire then? He looks poor because United as a whole is poor. Right?  Or does this only apply to de Ligt? > He’s also implying that with the right coaching and tactics you probably have a player in Maguire that can be of the same level as De Ligt.  See Maguire playing for england and I can see why. He was a level above Stones. 31 is a good age for a CB though, arguably hitting their prime.  Maguire was replaced because he is the most mocked player in the county. Disregard the ginger one. Sorry I didn’t realise u/simple_fact530 was a legend of football He is great at analysis after a game but he is one of the worst commentators Lmfao das ist jetzt hoffentlich nicht dein ernst lmao this sub is lost German pundits are such trash that even a dumbass like Matthäus shines for some of us lol Mate I played at a decent level and the game amateurs/semi pros play at is essentially a different sport to those in the PL. My teammates had some of the most pants-on-head dumb takes you'd ever hear, there's absolutely no correlation between playing Sunday league and having a more informed opinion on footy Mourinho didn't play competitively Do you know why Juve sold him? Because they needed money and Bayern made a giant bid. Nothing about player quality and Juventus hasn't won Serie A since he left so it's hard to say they’ve just bounced back since losing him. What’s incorrect buddy? Van Dijk is a terrible (but convenient for you I guess) example because he was such a rare later bloomer.    How many other CBs can you think of who were nowhere at 25 before becoming world class?    Who are like the top CBs at the moment? Saliba, Gabriel, Bastoni, Stones, Dias, Gvardiol, Rudiger. They're all either younger than 25 now, or were top class by 25. Rudiger didn’t become world class till his late 20s VVD was top class at Celtic and at Southampton. Do you honestly think De Ligt will show significant progress in the next couple years? He's extremely experienced for his age. Odds are he won't. This is what he is he had a great spell in a team that was performing incredibly at the time. But football's not a computer game. Potential isn't some untapped number. Many times it's wasted. VVD was playing fantastically at both Celtic and Southampton. He didn't peak at a young age. He kept improving.  You'll struggle to name many players who peak, stagnate for years and get back to top form. It’s not “muppetry” to talk about how new signings aren’t improving the team. It’s a consistent problem at the club. Not to mention we also signed Yoro the same summer. Who could well be an upgrade given his potential. And Maguire is 5 years older than De Ligt, paid a lot and running out of contract in a year or two. Our CB moves this summer have been smart squad maintenance regardless of how shit the rest of our team and manager have been. Because you don’t pay a depth player those ridiculous wages >why does it have to be when we needed depth for years and how can you now criticise De Ligt coming in for a bargain in todays market, at a great age, which furthers strengthens our depth?  This would make sense if Maguire was considered good enough to start regularly.  And you don't go drop 250k€+ a week and 40m€ few on a player if he is not a big upgrade on your average/underperforming player in your squad. De Ligt is the 5-7th highest paid defender in the league. Utd's highest paid defender.  If Utd wanted depth they could have signed Adarabioyo on a free. He was signed to improve the first team. He still most likely will but he was not signed and given those wages to provide depth. That’s why the clubs that finish ahead of us just have them?   No rubbish, it’s because we buy poorly. There are always obvious top players in the market and we almost never go for them.   We buy players with mildly encouraging numbers and somehow expect they’ll explode into superstars but SURPRISE, they never do.  Last guy who was KILLING it and signed for us exactly as he was in the middle of killing it was Bruno and look, wow, he did even better here.  Hojlund, Zirkzee, De Ligt, Ugarte just name a name…they’re all doing exactly how they did before us or worse but omg pikachu face, how can that be?!? The only reason Ten Hag's spending isn't under more scrutiny is because Chelsea outspent him 2:1 in the same period.   If he continues to underperform and Chelsea finishes high... Its gonna be talked about. We're really saying the squad hasn't gotten any better now? I thought we had a great transfer window offloading a bunch of dead wood and getting in a bunch of starters? Or are we simply being revisionist and saying this because we've had a horrible start to the season Dier and De Light were clearly the favorited cb pairing at the end? They were pushing him primarily because he was easy to sell, and someone had to go. They rated the hell out of him. In May last year our board called him a cornerstone defender for us.   He was also the only defender with any resale value and was the highest-paid defender we had. So selling him made the most sense. Kompany apparently didnt want to sell de ligt. He never started because Kim was overall better (Bayern fans love hating on the guy but stats don't lie) and took his spot. Tuchel probably judged Upamecano to be better on the right CB than just playing De Ligt on his unnatural side. Bayern fans called out for Kim/De Ligt all season but it wasn't as great an idea as they claim imo  But if De Ligt started the entire season, it wouldn't have been all that weird. I do think Bayern would've run into all the same trouble. He was great whenever he came on, but he was significantly better rested and didn't have the int'l responsibilities Kim had.   He has the potential to start for any top 4 team of any region, as long as they don't get a guy who's a slight upgrade And the hierarchy at Bayern are above reproach right? They’ve been shambolic the last couple of seasons both in decisions and public statements. You can’t just go “well the hierarchy wanted him out so they must be right”, as a United fan I can absolutely guarantee that many club hierarchies make shit decisions. Most Bayern fans would have agreed that he was their best CB option We paid 40mil on Uruguayan amrabat lol De Ligt had bad injury record last season, not his whole career.  United had really bad transfer marker record, but getting Mazroui + De Ligt for 60m Euro really isn't bad. Haven't heard a single united fan that's actually unhappy about the transfer.  I don't know if you realized but we had to start Jonny Evans for extended period last season because we lacked cover. De Ligt was brought in after Yoro was confirmed out for extended period of time. And guess what, Maguire is out as well now. We would have to field Evans again if we hadn't bought De Ligt. I always do. People hate having to accept reality, especially on Reddit. he’s definitely worse on the ball and struggles defending wide the same way Maguire does Casemiro and Ronaldo were both old as hell when they came/came back.  Time was going to catch them no matter what club they were playing for. What system? Ange was just appointed as head coach meanwhile De Ligt joins Utd with ETH in charge for 3 years. I don't think recruitment has much to do with it tbh. I honestly think you could put prime Messi in this utd team and be surprised how bad he looks. The culture is shot to shit. Heads are down. No one plays with belief. No one runs through brick walls any more.   You can be the best player in the world but when you're surrounded by players who have already adopted a mindset, it takes a lot more than recruitment to change it, otherwise you're just dropping a bit of wine into your water and expecting the whole thing to turn into a merlot. And before long, that player is playing for the paycheck as well. The culture has gone down the pan at utd. It's not a winning mentality anymore. There's a comfortability with losing..... Even worse, an expectation of it. Players don't go out any more with a ""this is Manchester utd"" mentality. And then when you hear stories about the poor facilities and off field antics.... The decision making that is concentrating this decline rather than alleviating it, it actually makes a lot of sense. I know the latest leadership has been making some better decisions, but it's handing over the wheel of the titanic after the iceberg has hit. They let it go too far. Sacking ten haag won't change it, they need to accept where they are and stop looking for silver bullets. Organisational level change. the atmosphere at OT is a talent suck I've seen this happen to a few clubs that have been successful in the past. The atmosphere can turn toxic fairly quickly during games. Supporters of clubs like Man UTD, Arsenal, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and so on have high expectations. I don't think that's wrong in itself, but it can become a yoke around the neck of a team that doesn't have the talent to meet those expectations. Every error, every poor decision and mistake can be met with derision which adds to the pressure which becomes a failure spiral that feeds back on itself. I think Martinez tries too much to be a hard man. Some of his tackling is awful and it seems he only gets away with it because he's funsized.  A pity because he can play with the ball at his feet and when he's not actively trying to look like a tough guy he can defend quite well. His reputation at Sporting was absolutely stellar. Lately it does seem like hes less forceful, for example ive seen him less often try a magic long shot. He still has a tendency to do magic through/longballs but i cant  think of recent ones (havent been able to watch lasr 2 matches :() Fair enough, he was big fish in a small pond in portugal, but he was clearly world class with the numbers he put up after moving to EPL. If you're a whisker away from KDB numbers while in a shit team that isn't winning anything significant and far from winning the league, I'd say he is world class. He literally broke Frank Lampard's goal scoring record from a midfielder at Sporting and had like 2 25+ goal seasons for them. I'm not gonna lie, I sorta expected him to be a monster. Surely whether someone is a great signing or not is usually considered in the context of what you paid for them? > Like I'm genuinely stumped as to how the club can't seem to challenge for major trophies despite all the money and attempts to fix things for over a decade now.  Because they're competing against well-run clubs with coherent strategies. There can be an institutional culture at some businesses, which football clubs are, that can affect the people working there. I suspect that the culture around United stems from absentee owners who offload the setting of standards onto others who aren't capable of doing so.   Ferguson would've demanded the highest standards and instilled that belief on everyone working under him. Players would've been recruited with the foreknowledge of the culture they were entering and the demands made upon them.   We learnt of SAF's annoyance when Moyes came in and replaced the backroom staff, this would've been where most of the demands of behaviour would've stemmed from. Suddenly you've got a new manager with new coaches and the players might have taken the opportunity to test limits.  I think what we see at United is the result of not having anyone with any authority in a leadership position for over a decade. Mourinho went there and couldn't make it work, he was undercut repeatedly by the finance guys. If you're seeing the manager being dealt with so badly by non-football operatives, where's the impetus for you to bother?   It may not even be a conscious thing, players see their team mates  not busting a lung to cover back and they wonder why they should be doing so. It continues on and the behaviour becomes systemic and not the fault of any individual and is therefore that much more difficult to root out. Is it some sort of curse or something?  I can’t be too mad.  I got to enjoy the SAF era. In my opinion, above everything else, the manager is the most important cog in the whole machinery. They might have undertaken some organisational changes, but they are dropping the ball by sticking with the wrong manager. Can't sack the owners It could be that they have hired the wrong manager every single time though The dawn of a new error Due largely to the Glazer obsession with extending contracts in order to preserve ""resale value.""   Players would languish into their late 20s-early 30s on albatross wages until they left on a free transfer; it's hard to revitalize your career that late on. United is a graveyard for talented coaches and players  for a reason. They're going to continue hiring and firing coaches and signing and getting rid of players because its fans are spoilt rotten and the pundits appear to want to make sure the club never wins a title again. de Ligt had multiple great seasons at Ajax though. Played in the EL final as 17 year old and was great that tournament This. And he hasn't been consistently benched for 2 clubs and a NT. Eric Dier benched him.. not a good sign If you Ask me. I mean he was every game I saw and the manager also thought so since he was the only consistent one and the other 3 were rotated Certainly true, I was just pointing out in the ways in which he is special. I think he will also improve in his technical ability, he's still young after all. Can't learn speed & mobility, though. Maguire also used to be known for his gallops up the field from left centre back.   I think with the sheer amount of minutes he played, often playing through injuries, he lost that part of his game. Yeah there's a reason Pep was in for him too back when he joined you. Sometimes I think how he would be seen had he joined City. He really is. Always hits those long diagonals beautifully It was Pogba who Maguire Higuita'd. There's more to passing than just being able to make great balls here and there, the deeper you play the more important it is to simply not give the ball away foolishly which maguire often does   It's way better to have a cb or dm who can only make simple passes but they do so consistently rather than someone who doesn't set up big plays for their team, but for their opponents too   The higher up the pitch you play, the less the risks matter because it's less likely to turn into a goal, but defenders and central midfielders have got to keep their shit tight > The man's a seriously good passer of the ball if he's given a bit of time and space.  PL defenders aren't afforded time and space, he plays the odd long ball that's decent but don't hype him up too much just because United are dogshit and he's no longer first choice. He actually has a pretty decent long ball in him but i would argue every PL level player is a good passer with enough time and space, under pressure i can remember him misplassing tons of passes You're right, but how many premier league players get time and space these days?   I I could swear I remember Maguire being a CB capable a passing and shooting at the goal, at least when he was at aston villa.   It is one of the reason why I liked him a lot, because he was a very progressive player. Yep, and it's absolutely organisation that is the issue, not the quality of the players. Ugarte and Mainoo are good players. But you could put Rodri in that midfield and he'd look overrun and lost.  I simply don't think you can play a two in midfield when the three ahead of them are Garnacho, Fernandes and Rashford. There's simply not enough defensive ability and discipline in those three to be able to play a two man midfield. Honestly I'd like to see a more conservative approach from United to steady the ship. In ETH first season they had a really good defence, I've no idea what's happened. But with Bruno out, I'd love to see how casemiro, ugarte and mainoo do with zirkzee as a false 9. It's also not just those three working hard and having defensive discipline, it's that in front of them Werner, Johnson and Solanke also worked hard and had positional discipline.  Imo, that's where many of United's issues stem from. The defense looks bad because it's exposed by the midfield. But the midfield looks wide open because it's a two man midfield playing behind a four man attack of Garnacho, Fernandes, Rashford and Zirkzee who simply don't contribute enough defensively.  You can get away with a two man midfield if your attack in front of it is disciplined and hard working. United's is not. You look less oafish when your small than when you are a slabhead It’s also his hardman rep, people ignore his many drawbacks because once in a while he’ll leave a great but crunching challenge on the opposition while winning the ball The problem for European clubs picking them up is the salary they are on rather than necessarily transfer fees. Wages wages wages. Players don’t take wage cuts He must have forgot deligt played against liverpool. But it's against Southampton he was motm One season, where Utd were pretty shite in general, of poor form doesn't make him a bad player though?  If he has multiple seasons of being a good player and one season of being a bad player, he's still a good defender? Yessir!!!!! in Addition to this , he seems to treat the ball like he has been told he is only allowed 3 touches , long hollywood passes without looking , whipping the ball into the box when nobody is there , it is like he has to try something every time he is on the ball Sure AWB had a good first season, but then regressed. Sounds familiar? Maguire was good at the start, and then he... regressed.   When you compare it to teams like City, Arsenal, Liverpool and even Chelsea (yeah, I know), these teams have far more examples of taking either unknown players and turning then into great players or doing the same with players deemed to not be good enough by others. Mctominay is doing exactly what he did at United. He's just too physical for Serie A. And it's been just a few games. Same for Sancho. Let's see where he is after a few months.     Smalling did well for Roma's level. There's a reason he didn't get a call back into the England set up      Depay did well in Ligue 1. Not PL     Di Maria didn't like Manchester. Nothing to do with his quality.      I wonder why Zaha and Welbeck never moved back up to a better club in the PL if they're good.  At least united under Ole forced teams to set up the low block  And right now teams don't even bother to play the low block because they know this current united is so bad that pretty much almost all the teams can waltz up to them and play their brand of football. The Ole vibes era is the most fun I’ve had supporting this club in a very long time. Remember 4-0 FC? That was awesome.  I would beg Ole to come back at this point. Fuck it give me McFred back at this point too.  It’s so much worse now. Ole did struggle at times and may not have been ""the"" man, but he was still far far better than this guy. Right whereas we are clueless against all forms of blocks atm. Off the dome, we have scored under 60 goals in both PL seasons under Ten Hag - in 2020/2021 we scored 121 goals under Ole. Such an improvement compared to current United that struggle against high press, mid blocks and low blocks. >was clueless against low blocks  If a Premier League quality team decides to sit back and defend there isn't a magical tactical bullet you can apply.  You win the majority of those games statistically, but you will lose some of them. Even City can't break down all low blocks. Ole was managed to finish second over Liverpool one season and was able to beat city once a season somehow. Idk why Ronaldo always gets mentioned with ole when he only had him for like 2 months Ole's problem was he went on long spells of bad form as well as good and as time goes by we only remember the good, he was nowhere near good enough for United either. Man I really don’t like Carl Anka for some reason. There was a period of time where every time he played he did something worthy of one of those compilation. Other periods, he plays like the ""art of defending"" compilations. Very much a confidence player. >compilations  Unless you are at the Ramos or Maldini level every CB has a compilation like that.  Juventus ""fans"" did the same with De Ligt when he was playing so poorly he got benched. Worth noting that most of those tiktok meme clips didn't actually feature maguire lol maybe in the sense there's more opposition fans but our subreddit absolutely chastised him when he was going through a rough period.   Now they pop up with the regular ""I'd just like to take another moment to apologise to harry Maguire"" comments after piling on him for months. Think theres a video of him biting a bee stinger out his daughters toe https://youtube.com/shorts/GDd5Ne6wIig?si=kpMBVuo3LYmfgZh1  To this day I cannot look at this perverted freak without thinking of this. I mostly pretend he, his daughter, and her toe nails don't exist [deleted] [deleted] This dodge was miserable. Hab ihn mal im englischen Fernsehen gesehen. Seine Analyse nach dem Spiel war ziemlich gut. in seinen anfangsjahren war der hamann niveau, auch im privatleben. die letzten 10+ jahre ist er aber richtig gut und einer besten ex-spieler kommentatoren. Again, I never said that playing at any level meant you knew what you were talking about.  Why are you framing what I’m saying so incorrectly? He’s played competitive football.  He’s even played professional football. for starters that he is somehow overrated on reddit. In every post about de Ligt people are critical on him and come with some insane takes which already tells that they barely watch him. (And no I'm not saying that he is a world class defender) Was Gabriel considered top class before 25? He's 26 now and it's only from last season that he was considered one of the best in the world. I think CBs are inherently just weird prospects. In pairings it's often difficult to predict which one is good, and systems matter a lot, because it's very difficult for them to keep playing well when constantly exposed.   To your examples:    1. Maguire himself was sold to United at 26 and really only became a prospect at 24/a hot prospect at 25.   2. John Stones was a huge prospect at a young age, but seen as a bit of a flop until 2019-2020 when he was 25.  3. Dias was genuinely great young.  4. Gvardiol is great for Croatia, but plays LB for City. I think this is Pep's way of aging him up to be the CB of the future.    5. Gabriel IMO broke through to become actually good at 24 (2 seasons past with the rest of Arteta Arsenal -- might indicate its a system thing)  7. Saliba might actually be The One -- I don't think he's the norm though.       6. Rudiger was allowed to leave Chelsea on a free @ 29. He was a hot prospect and then regarded as kind of mid. Now with Carlo + a better system he's one of the best. >How many other CBs can you think of who were nowhere at 25 before becoming world class?  Vidic, Stam, Rio - just from United.   I won't say that they were *""nowhere""* before United, but they joined United after 25 and then went to go up 5 levels of class. Ya, a level lower than the top Also, he would hardly be the first player to look great at Ajax and then not really kick on as expected after leaving. He's not even the only player from that Ajax team you could describe that way. Nice to see some people still calling them 'computer games' and the term 'video game' hasn't completely taken over. Not sure why it bothers me tbh, suppose I'm a bit of a man who yells at clouds Off the top of my head:  James Rodriguez, Kai Havertz, Kevin de Bruyne, Karim Benzema, Marco Reus, Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku, Cavani, Özil.  It’s indeed not much, but it’s defenitly possible But they are improving the team, or do you want Casemiro at CB again when we had 0 depth? > There are always obvious top players in the market and we almost never go for them.   Can you name these ""obvious top players""? I'm really interested to hear. Ehhh I sort of agree and sort of don't. I genuinely think he might be the most hated manager on the planet right now.  My confusion is the support for him lmaooo  I back him because they're a rival club but if we had Ten Hag results, Id throw a cabbage at Slot's bald head Offloading deadwood and spending nearly £200m should've put you well on track to make a Europa run atleast. Not drawing with FC Twente with your best squad.  It's about to be october, we're about to be closer to Christmas than compared to season start soon. But I'm Ten Hag in so don't get it twisted, I just think you're scouting and sporting director are on spice for buying these players. This is such bullshit. If they had wanted to sell Upa they would have had several clubs interested, not just United. De Ligt is slow, can't play the ball, not meant for the modern game. He has by far the lowest resale value outside of Dier. How come noone other than United wanted De Ligt then lol? Actions speak louder than words. Clubs like Bayern don't sell their best players just because they're ""easy to sell"". Musiala is easy to sell, you don't see Bayern hawking him off to anyone who would have him.  I'm sure they thought he was a good player, but not good enough to keep around. No one is beyond reproach. I'm not saying ""the hierarchy must be right, he's shite"", I'm saying that your statement that he was their starting CB at the time of departure is wrong.  Of course hierarchies can be wrong. But fans can be wrong too, and usually a lot more than any hierarchy. Fans’ judgment can be equally shambolic if not more so. Bayern have a solid claim to being the best run club in the world over the past decade or two. Their management is excellent Holy shit I didn't even realize how similar they are... wtf. I don't believe De Ligt is a good buy when you consider his wages. And considering Calafiori who can play LB if needed was available and is clearly massive for a top 4 side right now. Id think any FOOTBALL fan would agree, Yoro x Calafiori would be arguably one of the best defensive prospect pairings in the world.  Mazaraoui if he can stay healthy, and good health to both of them. Possibly a good buy but you already have Dalot. Imo good if he's 2nd option RB.  As for Evans idk, I didnt get to watch any Utd games other than late showings and derbies. But all I know is you ppl need to let the old man retire lmaoooo. But Im confused what happened to Lindelof? I know he starts for Sweden why isn't he ever in the squad? Surely he's better than Johnny Evans? People like you see Maguire pinging a ball to Rashford when he's in loads of space and can't stop talking about how good Maguire is on the ball. De Ligt is much better under pressure and keeping possession while collecting loose balls That's a criticism of the manager not the player being written as a criticism of the player for no good reason. Dalot jogging back in the 3rd minute of the game to let Brennan Johnson cruise in at the back post is honestly some of the worst defending I've ever seen. Literally kickabout tier commitment to defending. >You can be the best player in the world but when you’re surrounded by players who have already adopted a mindset,  This is a completely different team. If you look at the last 11 Rangnick put out and compared it to the last XI Ten Hag put out, there are only 2 players left over (Rashford, Bruno). This is as big of a rebuild/overhaul as we’ve done in recent years. >Players don't go out any more with a ""this is Manchester utd"" mentality.  And Moyes took over 10 years ago. Current players around 20 yo have only seen the tail end of the Ferguson era and are too young to remember ""This is Man Utd"".  Another 10 years of this and they'll be just a richer version of Nottingham Forest. The “this is Man Utd” mindset is part of the reason they’re in such a shit state.   Them winning the league in Fergies last season papered over so many glaring cracks in that squad, they needed a whole rebuild that would take some time. But instead because “this is Man Utd” they’ve instead tried to solve the problems with big name signings constantly.   The only time they’ve actually been in a position where there seemed to be an actual medium term plan was with Ole in charge and then they threw it all out of the window to bring Ronaldo back who ran completely counter to how the squad was being built and how he wanted the team to play.   If everyone involved with the club including pundits etc stopped thinking about how things used to be and instead appraised the situation as it is then they could properly plan medium term to be challenging again. You just look at how Arsenal backed Arteta with time and the freedom to get rid of players that didn’t fit into what he was trying to build and then financially backed him to bring in players he wants. They need a player with the mindset and killer instinct that zlatan had when he played for them. A leader who will whip them into form. Somehow reminded me of [this](https://youtu.be/syPxMG-o0as?si=JB5UsWoaIWVfatUu) guy No belief eh? You guys need a Ted Lasso ManU have 0 leaders tbh none of the veterans r actual leaders - none of the players play for the club - then u have ten Haag antics and stuff here and there They need another Munich disaster to sort that team out Players go to clubs for a variety of reasons: its prestige, the promise of trophies, the opportunity to work with a legendary coach and lastly, and what Utd have, money. They lost control of any semblance of a wage structure through poor management and now have a team full of mercenaries who when their backs are against the wall will wilt. Casemiro is a prime example: dude has won everything and got all the glory at Madrid, and has retired to Utd with fat wages and just no hunger. I think the difference is that players at the other clubs are actually passionate where as ManU has become somewhat of a retirement home It was, but his first few seasons at United were even better Yeah but a stellar reputation at Sporting and a stellar reputation at Man United are two different things. [deleted] So stellar he was playing for Sporting until the age 26 Because ETH has made him do everything and gassed him out. That’s what I’m saying. He had lots of hype before you signed him, but I don’t think even the most optimistic United fans would have thought he’d be as good as he was in the first year or so. The original comment was saying Bruno is the only player who has joined United and done well. Maguire came in when our defence was unreliable and/or injured and helped sort things out immediately.   United probably overpaid by £20m or so, but he was still a good get that has had a good time with us, particularly in his first two seasons. For me, that makes him a great signing. Reminds me of this xkcd: https://xkcd.com/2270/  Like at some point consistently making the wrong choice almost becomes impressive The previous seasons was great for a teenager and by Eredivisie standards- they werent as good as what he did in 18/19 which was basically world class play in the Champions League (what Juve paid for) Dier started all but like 2 of his matches with de ligt why do you think they brought him in? to rotate the cbs for injury management, make sense? Least stupid spurs fan He would have been judged differently simply because of the fact that City would not have paid as much as United did. Even if he did meh he would have been just another 50M defender at City, not one of the most expensive defenders ever. I'm sure after the shit some of our guys have taken for not being one man armies carrying the club on their backs similar thoughts have crossed their minds. i think having to adapt to a high line would still have exposed the weaker parts of his game and not focused on his strengths , but who knows. It would have een interesting to see for sure That's exactly what I was thinking. In another universe we play with a deep block utilising long through balls to punish teams on the counter, it's the perfect play style to unleash rashford and garnacho Shit you're right, I was remembering the clip where he nutted Ronaldo. The rashford extension is a joke.  Horrible football decision given his inconsistency. They play better with that set up anyway so i think it’d be good for them to try. Yeah that’s a really good point. We do kind of move as 10 players, whereas Utd had 10 players running in different directions. Same applies to strikers I reckon. Bad touches look so much worse with gangly long legs. Plenty of technically good tall players never got the credit they deserved, Crouch being one. No you don’t understand, he was atrocious that season. Other seasons I’ll admit he was decent decent. But I’ve never seen a “top” defender make comical errors on a weekly base and with him as captain he was by far the worse element on the team that year That's awesome! You have to love the bank of America corner kicks haha So to summarize:  - McTominay does well after he left - Sancho does well after he left  - Smalling did well after he left  - Depay did well after he left - di Maria did well after he left (stat wise, not just because he liked it better) - Zaha did well enough that several big clubs wanted him but he signed the wrong contract at the wrong time and priced himself out of any move - Welbeck literally played for Arsenal and won a cup with them, while finishing above Man United.   But feel free to move the goal posts if it helps convince you that no players have ever left Manchester United and gone on to do better elsewhere. Ole didn't win anything. You can pull up whatever statistic you want and it won't change the fact that Ten Hag won actual trophies.  Revisionism Ole has been getting is insane. People forgot how toxic the fanbase was towards the end and how clueless he was once the teams have figured us out. His biggest problem was that he refused to rotate the players. But given the quality of the bench (Bailly/Rojo/Young/Pereira/Lingard/Donny), it is understandable.  So he had to rely on likes of Pogba/Matic or McFred to dictate the game and the latter were consistently 7/10 players and former were consistently inconsistent. There was no backup for Bruno or Rashford either.  The only inexcusable one was picking De Gea over Henderson, especially in EL final. Sure everyone with a lengthy career has that. I’m talking about a couple of months at united. Why would you do that with your teeth? Fingernails and literally dozens of other things you can use. Yea, he sucks toes something in the water in manchester He absolutely did, to the point of winning Player of the month in November. Alright. If we both agree then ... we also agree that Paul Scholes have a pretty solid point.  de Ligt has not improved the United defense vis-a-vis Maguire. Brudi ich weiss nicht aber wenn dich unser loddar ernsthaft beeindruckt... Das is ja wie zu sagen Fler ist nen guter rapper Ist völlig OK wenn du meinst ""yo der loddar is nen guter und auf meinem Level"" TIL   Point made I guess He had been very good, with the occasional blunder in his game.  It does make you wonder how much higher his (Gabriel) ceiling is though Gabriel was comfortably world class since 22/23, which is the same time as people starting singing Saliba's praises.  All of us who have been watching them week in, week out have always seen them as a pair and two parts of one whole. It's just that Saliba kept getting the hype, and the media loves to run with narratives. Now the pendulum has swung somewhat, and saying ""actually, Gabriel is really good too"" is the cool thing to say. Yes Rio who was the world's most expensive defender at 23. Rio Ferdinand was 23 when he signed for United and won the PL in his first season. He was widely considered one of the best defenders in the world by the time he was De Ligt's current age. Big difference though in that Vidic and Stam were playing low level football in their early 20s. SC Cambuur + Spartak Moscow, vs De Ligt who's been at Ajax, Bayern, and Juve, with over 300 appearances. Rio you might have a point although he did kind of cement himself as one of the best defenders in the world at around 24-25. No shit, we bought all of them. Also, he would hardly be the first **person** to look great at Ajax and then not really kick on as expected after leaving. He's not even the only **person** from that Ajax team you could describe that way.  ftfy Guess we're both showing our age, eh? > Not sure why it bothers me tbh  Because ""video games"" is American English? There's too many wrong names here to go through them all, but it's mental that you name people like KDB who did nothing but continually get better since Werder Bremen. You'll struggle to name one season he stagnated, let alone multiple years. Most of those examples make no sense?    James Rodriguez never got back to his top form.   Kai Havertz, a decent example.   Kevin de Bruyne, an upwards trajectory from Wolfsburg.   Karim Benzema, I don't know what you are trying to get at here? He had some seasons not as good as others and had injuries.   Marco Reus, injuries were the issue.   Paul Pogba never got back to top form for a season.   Romelu Lukaku never stopped scoring. 1 season he didn't score 10+  Cavani, he just got old?   Özil never recovered from his decline at Arsenal. You're 13th with a -3 GD and other than Liverpool, you've played us, Soton, Fulham, CP and Brighton. Is the improvement in the room with us? Ten Hag has had £616m spent on players since he took over. This is the wider picture and is directly related to what Scholes is saying. £160m of that is on centre backs.  De Ligt wasn’t signed to add depth and he wasn’t cheap. United are 13th and you are talking about your 60 mill, massive wage player like he mainly added depth. After saying this money was too much for Branthwaite and United were tired of overpaying, they went for a player whose reputation has always outstripped what he provides. This is what I don't understand. He is a future captain I guess.  Idk, something got lost in translation at some point, I don't understand this club or its fans. Hated? Is he fuck everyone but Man Utd fans love him he’s hilarious.  Do we understand why he’s hired? No, but do we hate him? Never.  This is a fucking car crash and everyone slows down and stares at a car crash. Right, we sold him because he was the highest-paid defender and we're trying to get our wage bill in order and was our only player at the position with resale value. Kompany also wanted a player who was faster and better on the ball (Upamecano).   That doesn't mean De Ligt isn't fantastic at what he does. Us selling him and him not being ace in his first month also doesn't make Maguire a better player. Lindelof was injured as well buddy. Why do you think we played Evans? We literally had no better option cause our injuries were so bad. United would've been silly to bet it all on Yoro and Calafiori. The former is a teenager with one season of professional football under his belt, and the latter has only had one good season in a major league and looked decent in an awful Italy team at the Euros.  Arsenal could afford to take the risk with Calafiori because they had better players already at the club and could ease him in if needed. United don't have that, so signing Yoro and someone like De Ligt made sense. Calafiori wasn't available to us. He joined Arsenal straight after the Euros. He moved to a Champions League team. We aren't that. We only qualified for the Europa, and that was via the cup. We finished 8th. We moved for Yoro with the idea that he'll eventually be a starter. He's been unlucky to get injured in pre-season. I doubt Calafiori would want to be splitting minutes with another developing defender. In his position, he'll likely want to be challenging for a starting spot, if not starting.  Lindelof has also been injured. He was in the squad over Maguire last game, it was his first game back from injury.  I don't know if you followed United's woes last season, we had an unbelievably bad time with centre back injuries last season. We went through 14 different centre back pairings, all of them forced by injury. Our starters last season were supposed to be Varane and Martinez. Martinez broke his foot twice, Varane was in and out over and over and ended up retiring last month due to injuries. Maguire, usually ever-present, had a few knocks throughout the season and ended it injured, forcing him to miss the Euros. Lindelof ended up covering at left back due to Shaw, Malacia and on-loan Reguilon's injuries, and Vic also ended up getting injured because we couldn't rotate him. Evans, who was 5th choice CB, ended up playing 30 games last season, and that ran him into the ground too. We ended up in games playing 19-year old Willy Kambwala and Casemiro out of position.  Varane's contract expired, Kambwala went to Villarreal, Aaron Wan-Bissaka went to West Ham. We needed an experienced defender and a full back. We got both for £60m in De Ligt and Mazraoui. One of the things I’ve noticed he’s much worse at than people claimed. He looks slow on the ball and has been making loads of ball playing mistakes for a CB That's kind of the point. Other teams should fear utd signing sancho, or casemiro, or de ligt, or whoever, but it doesn't matter because every time utd bring new players in, they drop them into a mess. At this point it doesn't matter who utd sign, fans of all the clubs around utd think ""yeah, that won't change anything.... Another player gone to decline at utd for big wages"". It's kind of like that [monkey experiment](https://www.proserveit.com/blog/five-monkeys-experiment-lessons) though.    If a new player comes into the team, and sees the heads of 10 others dropping after every conceded goal and sees his teammates not putting in effort in training and on the pitch, they'll quickly lose motivation too. It's not like they changed all 11 players at once. Those new signings have come in one by one and they have each suffered from the same fate. They need a manager like Klopp or Arteta who can singlehandedly change the culture and atmosphere around the club and the job is a lot harder for a club with United's expectations I honestly see them doing a Liverpool and going 30 years without a league title.   It's going to get much worse before it gets better. Our match going support coddles them a lot too. At any other club, fans would be asking questions to them, here it's singing for 90 mins while players are doing absolutely nothing. Lol, nah, can't be, I'm a Liverpool fan so I'm absolutely loving it, just pointing out the obvious. This guy's heart and soul has been torn out through his underpants watching his Chelsea team get obliterated. 😂 How do you measure that? I think you don't realize how good he was in a Sporting team that was a complete disaster. You have no clube what you're on about  No it wasn’t. And it wasnt a stellar reputation either, he had a bad spell in Italy and people were saying he could only hack it in the Portuguese league. Absolutely, considering how poor Utd's management has been in the last decade. No he was not With 8 goals? Just blatantly untrue. He scored 8 goals and wasnt even in top10. Why just make shit up when literally anyone with an internet connection can prove you wrong? He's still putting up good numbers, even though his position has changed and the forwards are scoring a lot less goals than they used to.   I can't stand the moaning about Bruno from the media, because he's an obvious target when the team isn't playing well. Sure, shit on our *checks notes* 3 time club POTY when he's still producing chances that our forwards can't put away. Absolute disgrace. How does that make any sense to you? They brought him in just so the other, ""better"" CB's wouldn't have to play as much so they opted to play a worse CB in every game including crucial CL games? To be honest, i personally loved when we played like this with Ole - usually against city etc - Long diagnonals for Rashford and Dan James to chase. That style really suited our squad. Was always good fun seeing them crumble after they have tried to socre for 70 mins only to concede to us on the counter - then scotty pinching the winner. Fun times.  The caveat is - Maguire certainly does need tonnes of time and space to be comfortable making those passes.  Onana and Licha are also able to do it - seems like we are missing a trick really. I'd much rather we play like inter in the CL final - Onana was immense He should absolutely go back to playing a low line and inviting pressure.  Either he can’t coach them to do it, or our players are incapable of converting possession into goals. I've thought for a while that it would benefit both him and the club if Rashford left.   From the club's point of view he's difficult because being an incredibly talented academy product he ends up being treated differently to other players, but his performances don't really merit it.  From his point of view, he often looks like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders and that his heart isn't really in it any more. He also basically hasn't much developed as a player since he was 18, because of the chaos of the club and because he's never been consistently well coached.  I think it would be better for both if he left. > Crouch being one  I'll never forget him being cautioned for diving after a defender tripped him … with his thigh. >If he has multiple seasons of being a good player and one season of being a bad player, he's still a good defender? Lmao they are the best kind of corner kicks! Van de boek   Wan Bissaka   Dean Henderson   Bailly   Garner     Daniel James   Mkhitaryen   Januzaj   Schneiderlin   Chicharito     Now explain why all of these players were terrible after leaving. In your list, maybe only 2 did well at a top club level. Even average players can go and become a hero in Ligue 1. That doesn't reflect anything regarding their time at United. His biggest problem was that we had one style of playing.  We'd sit back, defend and then counter. Once teams realised this, we had absolutely no way of beating teams that didn't play into this. Results fell away so quickly.  We had 2.46 PPG in his early days as caretaker.  We had 1.31 PPG during his permanent tenure.  None of this is to attack him or defend ETH, but the revisionism of Ole is ridiculous. > His biggest problem was that he refused to rotate the players.  He had a million problems. All of them sum up to him being a poor manager which is why no other club has gone near him since being sacked by you lot.  There's so much revisionism with him now. Right ... just like de Ligt at Juve. And why the hell would you film it and post it on the internet? Suction.  Up until now I'd always thought he was a disgusting pervert but the bee sting actually makes sense. Suction I guess. I mean tweezers would be easier but sometimes you snip/lose the end of a stinger or splinter in your skin and have to kinda, suck it out or cut your skin.. [deleted] [deleted] Agreed he was always good, but I don't think he was conisdered ""top class"" until last season. Yes, he was. But he wasn't the world's best defender at 23. Or even a great defender at that time. He had regular howlers at United for his first 3 years at United, not to mention the whole drugs thing.  He cost so much because a) he was very good, b) very young, c) English, d) United tax, e) United were getting him off of Leeds; it was worse than United buying a player from Arsenal during peak Fergie-Wenger. Truly spoken like someone who hadn’t watched him play at that time.   He wasn’t half the player he became after during 2006-07 and beyond until then. He really became a world class CB after 26-27. That’s the initial point. Yeah this is exactly it. The Americanisation of the language bothers me De ligt had injuries too?  And Lukaku was really bad for 3-4 seasons and now he is doing well again at napoli You're putting words in my mouth, De Ligt is not a poor buy is what I'm saying, idk what you're on about We've had Evans and Casemiro in CB end of last season and now have De Ligt, Martinez, Maguire and Yoro, that's all there is to say. He is the last one to be used as an example of poor recruiting No, I said _assuming he is right_ he is still a depth player. Fucking hell you all seem so angry, read what I said - Idk where this false analysis is coming from, De Ligt is nowhere near the reason we're 13th. He's played 4 meaningful games for us(played more than 15 mins), Liverpool, Spurs, Palace and Southampton. Kept a clean sheet in the last two and was not the reason we lost the first two. - He was €45M/£38M and €5M in add ons. Nowhere near ""60 mill"" Don't get me wrong, I love him. I'm very excited for us to see him again asap. Bayern sold him because they believed they could replace him without suffering.   That doesn't mean that they thought he was shite, but it certainly means that they didn't ""rate the hell out of him"" either. They saw him as disposable for a mediocre amount of cash.  High wages and market values only matter when the player isn't delivering on the wages and market value. Players like Kane at Bayern, Vinicius at RM etc. make even more than De Ligt but there's not a chance that either could be sold voluntarily. [deleted] Even if you put aside Calafiori, Danso was sold this season from Lens. He's insanely underrated and actually good. I'm just baffled at how incompetent your scouting and sporting directors are to spend this kind of money on players who clearly aren't going to be enough for a top 4 finish. You make it sound like it’s all about the wages and while it does have a bit of an impact, we don’t have the highest wage bill in Europe…or even England for that matter yet the teams above us (maybe PSG exempted) perform way better than we do. Do you got to the games? He absolutely carried Utd for his first 6 months and beyond that he was excellent for the first few years. And United weren't exactly great beyond him. I think the Portuguese league is kinda shit and also very top heavy. I think what he did in his first to PL seasons required more quality. I mean, United has been a disaster ever since Fergie left Literally no one knew Bruno Fernandes prior to Sporting. Not even in Portugal. I think his problem is that he’s extremely easy to dislike. If he wasn’t such a prick, I think he’d get a lot more praise. > because he's never been consistently well coached.  You see I'd somewhat agree with you but the guy is routinely offside at the age of 26 to the point where you question if he even understands the offside rule. Combine that with his laziness and complete lack of commitment to helping his teammates out and you realise it goes well beyond bad coaching, the guy is a liability. You specifically said he “always has been good”. He hasn’t. He had atleast one (and in fact it was longer than that) when he was very very very “not good”. You don't have to make stuff up to attack him. Ole last season  when he got the sack was 1.41 ppg. The other seasons his lowest was at 1.89. He never went anywhere close to 1.31. https://footystats.org/managers/norway/ole-gunnar-solskjaer  ETH last season was closer to couple months of disaster under Ole, and this seasson is looking at a way lower ppg than that disaster. If anything it's ETH that's looking lucky to get a 1.41 right now. https://footystats.org/managers/netherlands/erik-ten-hag  Ole ball was way better than whatever the hell we have been producing for the last one and a half year. Tbf that was her who posted it , not him. Not that it's any better but I doubt he would have. Is that common practice on the Isles? Can't say I've ever heard of people sucking out bee stings where I live, or anywhere really. I've hear about sucking snake venom out, but even then many doctors/specialist tell you it doesn't really help much other than fucking up your teeth. You say that like those are bad numbers, but are they? They don't *sound* like bad numbers.   So you are saying that in 22 games with Maguire, they conceded 29 goals, and in the 16 games without Maguire, they also conceded 29 goals? So in 72% of the games, they conceded the same amount of goals without Maguire in the team? Sounds like he improved there defence quite significantly.   For comparison, Maguire conceded 1.3 goals a game. Van Dijk conceded 1.1, which isn't exactly a massive difference. >because of the pure awful tactics makes him look worse  Exactly -- 100% this. Couldn't agree more with you.   With a tactically astute manager (e.g. Southgate) Harry Maguire looks like an excellent CB. Leeds broke the transfer record for him first. He was the starting CB for England and Ferguson's United at 25. He was clearly very good and much better than De Ligt currently is.  He might have got better with age (like lots of players do), but he didn't go from average to amazing at 26/27. Sure but he's still playing almost 40 games every year. His injuries are just normal. Not like Rues who was hardly able to string a run of games together.  Lukaku wasn't even that bad for those seasons. He played in a system that didn't suit him and still scored 16&12 league goals for Utd. He decent for Roma last year. The key thing for Lukaku is playing under Conte. We'll see, it's very early but you've been even worse than last year, so I don't get what improvement to the team you see He’s certainly not the last one to be used as an example of a player not performing well though and looking lost in the system. De Ligt has proven himself for longer than either of those two, so there is less risk involved in signing him.  He's barely in the door 10 minutes. Maybe give the lad a while to settle in before we judge how good of a signing he is. Are you sure about that? Because Kevin Danso is still at Lens because he has an [underlying heart condition that requires heart surgery.](https://www.nationalworld.com/sport/football/kevin-danso-former-premier-league-player-to-undergo-heart-surgery-4794449) Roma were in for him but decided against it because of the heart issue and he hasn't played this month whilst he waits for surgery. I don't think he'd currently improve our team either. What makes you say that they’re not good enough for a top 4 finish? Sure, we have a history of spending way too much for average players. But what makes you say that £60m for those two is so bad? De Ligt has been fine and Mazraoui has been maybe our best player this season so far You're making my point though in a roundabout way. It doesn't matter who you bring in or what you pay them, it won't fix an organisational and cultural problem at the club. The issues are in the bare fundamentals.   And casemiro definitely came for big wages, but that's not the point being made. My point is wages don't matter. Utd can still attract top players because they still have a massive brand and whichever way you slice it, can pay a decent whack to help encourage players to join.... Just none of it matters until the fundamentals are in place. It’s not about wages, it’s about other fans expectations. When City or Arsenal sign a big name, fans of other clubs are worried about how well they’ll perform and the added difficulty to the fixtures with those teams. When Man U sign a big name, we shrug our shoulders because at this point we know it won’t change anything. The wages is a side point. I can't But that's the point - he absolutely carried Sporting when Sporting weren't exactly great beyond him. Yes I’m not saying he wasn’t great at United either   I’m just saying people don’t realize what a mess Sporting was at the time Totally, best player in the league for his first 18 months. But he was also the best player in the league at sporting for 2 full seasons with something like 50 goals between them. I was gunna say that his teammates were a big factor, then I remembered it’s United were taking about.   Bruno’s teammates at Sporting relative to the middling squads at United really highlight how much he’s flourished despite a mediocre cast since he himself has basically become world class since departing the Liga.   He had even more help at Sporting and yet still had levels in his game afterwards. I think it comes down to the competition to an extent too. Not really any more top heavy than the prem I never said otherwise ? I think stuff like that is still down to the lack of coaching though. He's basically still entirely raw. He's a bundle of talent and physical attributes with little to no refinement. He plays like a talented teenager, and getting caught offside all the time is one example of that.   I'm certain that if he'd had some years of proper coaching he wouldn't be doing that, and he'd be a really good player. Sadly, at 26, I think that ship has sailed. I don't think he'll ever reach his ceiling now, he's missed out on too much development in key years. He is the perfect example   Is he good? Sure for a team hoping to place 16-12th I didn't mean to make anything up, just googled it and it came up with this:  https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/EPL/Solskjaers-record-compared-to-every-previous-Man-Utd-manager/2199934  Maybe they were including the European matches too? I don't know.  Anyway, like I said, I'm not defending ETH, he deserves sacking too.  But the Ole revisionism happening on this thread is quite funny. He was great as a caretaker but in over his head as a permanent manager. Nowhere near talented enough to be a genuine option and his style of play was largely figured out pretty quickly. [deleted] [deleted] Doesn't matter at all in the discussion we're having; it's not if he was the most expensive defender or not, it's whether or not he ""matured"" after 25 - which he did by leaps and bounds. We are still not good overall but improved in defense imo which is telling on how bad we really were. Last season we've had 3 problems, defense being very shaky - midfield wide open - attack not scoring goals. Now (imo) defense is not so shaky anymore, midfield not so open anymore but attack still not scoring goals. We do look better and in some games pretty good, some of those games last season were atroscious when you compare. 2nd with 17 big chances missed 1 behind you guys right now is just insane, idk why we are not clinical and it would change a lot I think I didn't know deal fell through or about the heart problems, good health to him. But yes I think Danso (if not for heart problems) would be a better fit considering you lot have an enranged little man trying to land a brexit tackle every game and Primark Maguire now. And considering I haven't been wrong so far, I'm going to say my guess isn't a bad one.  But hey who knows, if the guy goes through surgery and misses the season he'll be one hell of a bargain for a 27 year old CB. I see. I do agree cultural issues exist but what I often don’t hear is how to change it. We literally just had the front office gutted and replaced with what I assume are very qualified people to run things.  I look at Arsenal and see them in a similar situation not too long ago but it changed when Arteta stepped in (even with Kronke still at there) I care a lot less of fan perception and more on how it impacts the culture of the club Well then you’re in no place to criticise those that actually spend their hard earned cash and do go and support the team. sure but doing the same he did at Sporting, but with United and in the premier league is still a step up? Going from being the best in Portugal to the best in England surely is a step up. Bruno Fernandes is not world class. There are 5, maybe 10 players in his position ahead of him. Disagree, I think the bottom half of Portugal would be absolute annihilated if they competed in a league with the bottom half of the PL. There's an incredible economic difference. Bottom of LP is worth 16m euros. Bottom of PL is worth 370m euros. As much as you can say a lack of coaching contributes… he’s 26. At this point if he isn’t putting that extra effort in there is 0 reason for them to continue to play him.  Can blame external factors as much as you want but he’s got to make the effort to get better himself. That was only for the last season he was in charge up to that point in the article. You can't have 1.36 average through the tenure when you came in top 4 twice and ran pretty deep in some cups. He was even at the top of the table in January 2021 for a week or 2 lol.  He is not a top coach long term, but he had us playing really well for multiple stretches. The come back FC stuff had tip top mentality too. Fuck it I'll take him back as care taker for the season. At least he could set up a defense. >Mate, why are you sucking him off so much? He isn't going to fuck you you know?  I'm not, I'm having a conversation about a footballer on a football subreddit. It's perfectly normal behaviour, I promise you don't have to be consistently hostile about it, nor do you have to start enacting your sexual fantasies in the comments. We can just talk about football.  >The fact you compare him to Van Dijk is a joke because defenders are asked to do more than just defend. Van Dijk can carry the ball better, pass better, looks for more forward passes, be an actual outlet during presses.  Erm, mate, you are the one who bought up ""goals conceded per game"" as the metric, not me, and if that is your metric (again, yours, not mine) then his numbers there are actually pretty good, by citing that they are not far off of the literaly best defender in the world, yet you made out like his number of goals conceded per game were bad.  Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure injury is the main reason why Man Utd keep signing new center halves, considering they ended last season with a pairing of Casemiro and Johnny Evans, and after recovering, Maguire once again got injured. and Martinez isn't exactly known for being a beacon of health.   Also, as you pointed out in your last comment, he played 22 league games for United last season, and missed 9 through injury so I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion that he ""can barely get into the Man Utd squad"".   Again, I can just quite literally retort with the fact that he won a player of the month last year, he clearly did look good. Obviously not to your levels of analysis way up up in the far upper echelons of tactical knowledge. But, compared to the lesser minds like mine he might.  Where Capello, Eriksson, and ten Hag's old mentor (McLaren) failed, he succeeded.  So he must at least have some insights to the inner workings of the game. He kept improving which is probably more important. Rio wasn't the same player he was at 18, 23 and 26. He kept improving. Is De Ligt a better player from a few years ago? With all due respect, how can you honestly say you haven't been wrong when your only two suggestions have been two guys completely unavailable (for various reasons). In the two opportunities you've taken to try and one-up the ""incompetent"" scouts, you've bungled both. And I'm not trying to hold you to the same standard as a professional scout or anything, it's their job vs your speculating. But dude, at least do a quick google before you post about how you supposedly know better than someone.   There is more to come from De Ligt. Yes, the Spurs game was shocking. But it wasn't an individual poor performance. Everyone looked unsettled and rushed and it led to poor decision-making from the midfield and attack which meant constant turnovers against a good Spurs side. Unfortunately, by the time the team settled, we were down to 10 and the game was gone. That was a team-wide failure. I'm personally unsure about Martinez as a long-term starter, but I do rate De Ligt and I'm interested to see how Yoro works out. Maguire simply isn't good enough in a team that wants to keep a higher line. De Ligt is better on the turn, better in short possession, better in one-on-ones. Maguire has a better long diagonal and is imperious aerially defensively, but those aren't enough really. Cool, the conversation was about fan perception and you decided to involve yourself in that convo. This isn't a valid argument anymore. I am spending my cash to buy a subscription to the service that hosts the Premier league, I have the right to criticize the team and fans, since that's what PL is selling to me.  Me and thousands of others buying that subscription is the reason why PL has billions of  dollars in TV deal and those fans get to see expensive players like Antony and Bruno play live.  I get your sentiment here, don't get me wrong here. I respect the match going fans, they have made themselves clear with Glazers and Moyes but they need to say something about players.  OL fans did for example and performances did improve. Oh for sure, but like, he was still just shitting on everyones numbers at sporting. I thought it was wild nobody other than Spurs was in for him. And based on his numbers for the first 2 years alone, he would have been worth it. Bruno can walk into any starting 11, except maybe Real Madrid’s. I think that constitutes as world class no? That's league strength not whether or not they're top heavy or not.  In 19/20 when Bruno moved, both leagues saw the bottom team get 21% of the points of the Champions.  In fact the standard deviation of points in the league is less than 2 thousandths from each other. I don't think it's anything to do with him not trying. It doesn't matter how hard he tries, if he's not getting good coaching he simply won't improve. I've seen it happen a lot. It's just relatively unusual to see it happen with a player of Rashford's talent, because players of that level usually end up working with good coaches.  It's unusual for someone with that much talent to have got about 8 years into their career without really ever being well coached. You're all over the place; every comment has a completely different point. wym why can I say I haven't been wrong?   I literally haven't been wrong about your transfer business. Like literally. As in I have been correct, also as in, not wrong. You have no more say over how match going fans should support the team than you do over how someone should act in a Netflix series.   You’re a consumer. Lol what? Leeds broke the transfer record for Rio. Utd did so again for him.  You are trying to rewrite history. He was considered the best CB in the league when Utd bought him. What is a match going fan, then? Especially for PL clubs. This isn't a semi-pro club in Vanarama North where your money and support sustains the club. This is PL. Every match going fan is also a consumer, especially in PL.  Unless you have voting rights and club membership like some of the German clubs and Spanish clubs, you aren't something different, you are just a consumer too, doesn't matter how many games you attend. You sold your club and community around it to the club owners. The discussion is whether or not he got better as he aged - and he did considerably so after he turned 25-26. How many other CBs can you think of who were nowhere at 25 before becoming world class? Is the question you were answering. And you answered Rio. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I see I'm talking to an actual clown. brother you are LOST"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.*   >I don’t want to say that Real Madrid always has the referees  Xavi: I'll bloody say it. Next press conference. Bayern-Real semifinals produce enough controversy and salt for a lifetime. I am so angry the ref took the spotlight of an amazing game.  The mistake was outrageous and easily avoidable. Totally bottled it at the last moment. I noticed that about 9 minutes into the allotted 9 minutes of injury time, the referee openly gestured to everyone in the stadium that there was to be another 2 minutes added on. I've never seen this done. Very odd but kinda cool. He also played about 4 minutes after the additional additional 2 lol It's a shit way to end the game, but don't let it take away from Bayern slipping up at the crucial moments and Joselu getting possessed twice. They looked dead in 78’, 30 more minutes would put some of their careers to sleep Im sad that this amazing game will be remembered by the awful mistake by the ref.  Would it be goal? Would it not?  Let it play, dont blow the whistle... We also had Sane and Kimmich on our side today which helped we will come back in the third leg dont worry guys Not that the referee didn’t make a mistake in stopping play when the flag went up. But if he was seriously favouring Madrid he would’ve blown the whistle for full time before this even happened. The referee fucked up but to say he deliberately favoured Madrid just seems false. Hate that the comeback will be marred with that ref decision at the end - he shouldn’t have called the whistle but also Madrid defenders stopped playing pretty much so who knows if it’s a goal for certain- just stupid and ugly Lol even had it been allowed there was another 30mins with all their best players subbed out Dumbass officiating tainting a completely deserved win from Real Madrid. Eh Madrid was better the majority of the match, and I don't think the main ref had a bad game at all imo.  The linesman should totally be sanctioned though, can't make these kind of mistakes in such an important game Bayern players should be thanking the ref for giving them an easy excuse for this atrocious performancee Meh, we lost out on qualifying vs Bayern because of a miscall on morata. Should’ve been 3-0 at half. It happens to everyone Oof a bit selective in the quoting Romano We did not deserve to win and I will puke if any of our players or Tuchel attempt to hide behind it, but it's hilarious to see Real get the 2-1 off of the same situation that prevented us getting that attempt What made the difference was your team falling asleep after the 80th minute ~~Matthijs de Ligt~~ Xavi: “I don’t want to say that Real Madrid always has the referees with them but that made the difference today”. I think real being better team by a mile is what made difference today Silly, if any team deserved to win then it is Real. Yea we told the ref to not give us any favorable decisions when we were down a goal and wait until 90+10 to help us. What a clown. Yes it was a shit call but our keeper and defenders stopped playing when the whistle blew. You can just assume you would have scored had the ref not blew the whistle. We won because we were the better team  Is he forgetting how Bayern bottled it in the last minutes? The last fuck up could have ended up a goal but we will not know because the players stopped playing anyway. It's a bad excuse. I am fucking pissed at the ref and the linesman. The ref should have ended the match already, the asisstant shouldn't have raised his flag. It might have been offside anyways, or Bayern might not have even scored if he lets it go, but now all we will read about is this situation.   We were better the entire game, we deserved to win, but all of that will be buried under this mess. Just let us fucking lose without a controverse decision for once please. The difference was made by a cowardly, stupid head coach, not the referees [deleted] Tuchilban changes what killed Bayren Linesman definitely should have just let it go on, but people are acting like a legit goal was scored and then taken away on review which is totally disingenuous. They just had it in the box, buddy kicked it into the net a good few seconds after the defenders and keeper stopped playing when they heard the whistle. It took away a chance, 100%, but it's a stretch to say ""disallowed goal"" I remember the WC final when we all praised the referee for making the right decision instantly without resorting to VAR. But making a decision instantly leads to an increased risk of making mistakes. Here it was a clear mistake of not letting the situation play out. I am sure that the referee team feels worse than us about the mistake and will regret this decision. But it is a massive mistake and should be taken into consideration when choosing referees for upcoming top matches. “I don’t want to say it”  -man who said it Horrible decision, but the referee ain’t your main problem if you lose a 1-0 lead in the 87th minute. He also said ""Madrid deserved it."" But yeah skip that from your quote.   Nevertheless, ref fucked up but Madrid players stopped playing so we will never know if they would have scored if the ref hadn't whistle I’m just going to say it. It’s okay to make mistakes guys. Was it silly? Yes. Was it a defining moment of the game? Possibly. Did Tuchel and Ancelotti have more of an impact on why the result happened? Absolutely.  The Ref was good all game and made one mistake just like Neuer. Would Bayern players hound Neuer and say he was the reason they lost?   Bayern Munich had absolutely no chance going into that extra time anyway. Obviously we’re not fully to know that but people blaming the ref for taking away the other stories when in reality it’s everyone getting mad for a genuine mistake that’s taking away from all the other stories. Was Neuer the referee? Even if the play continues, it's not a guaranteed goal.  Plus, even if you score, it's more 30’ playing against Bayern B team thanks to Tuchel. Yea yea how about you play all minutes and stop thinking you can win a 1-0 to Madrid lmao. Wasted all that time and then blame us for their shenanigans lol The score would still be 2:2 anyway, even if Bayern wasn't ""robbed"". Oh stuff a sock in it. Real madrid outclassed bayern in every possible way. The ref was not the difference tonight This linesman and the referee ruin a perfect game for both Bayern and Real Madrid. But I'd say more for Real Madrid. They were a better team today. They deserved the win. But now it's tainted, especially if Real Madrid goes on to win the final. >you think they are dead,  >Real  That's your first mistake man... Kanye is that you? How suprising real madrid got away with it... Pretty sure Real would have won anyway, but at least let it play out. Everybody acting like ref did a good game why? Rudiger had 5 instances in the first half that should have been yellow. Real god a good chance when ref let play go on with 2 balls on field. Another great chance came from an obvious freekick. All this in the first half, anyone who did not think real would get back after seeing that in the first half is dumb. The ref didn't make Neuer fumble the ball to Joselu nor did they take off Sané, Musiala & Kane but point taken.   Funny how all controversial referee decisions happen with Madrid This is tiresome. The only reason they had a chance to shoot was because the ref blew his whistle and the whole defence stopped, that ball was getting easily blocked by a defender or saved by Lunin. „That made the difference tonight“.   Sorry but that’s not been the difference when you have a xG of 0.38 compared to madrids 2.9. Bayern was passive all the game. No big chances created. Madrid way too sloppy with their chances and Neuer had a huge game. However, I can understand the frustration as the referee clearly made a mistake. Either way, the better team went through. ah but letting the game go 6 minutes over the 9 minutes added is okay, right Matthijs? If Neuer wasnt there, it’d be 5:0 at halftime. maybe try not being dogshit next time Sucks that now they can blame it all on one play and not take any accountability for the shit season they had and the shit substitutions and game plan implemented when they got the lead, which was by as individual as a play can get, as a collective they were garbage and hanging on by a thread all game but they can just pretend all that isn't true and blame the ref over a play that if there was no whistle can have gone either way but they act like it was a guaranteed goal, even if they did convert it they would have gone back to their shit strategy and bottle it in OT. Game seemed like a predictable fast and furious movie script or a computer algorithm. Everything was exactly as everyone expected . Real losing till 85th minute . Then late goals for RM win with an unexpected mistake by a big name goalie and a controversial referee call and Tuchel making Tuchel decisions that leave you astonished . I predicted this , you predicted this and everyone predicted this .  Also might as well give the UCL to Real Madrid . They will win the final 3-1 . Dortmund will make it 1-1 and look threatening and then Real will score two in the final 10 mins. They run like a movie script or computer algorithm. Yes it was the ref casting a magic spell to make Neuer fumble the ball on what was a routine catch 🙄 I really feel like it WAS an offside. People can whine about the quick whistle but if it turns out it IS the good call (which I really think it is), why all this useless drama ? Pretty rough on Bayern but they were outclassed the whole game.   Tucheliban going for 6 back with 20 mins to go was comical 😂😂 Games going to be remembered by that final call at the end regardless and a “what if” I mean, that's just total nonsense.  Embarrassing really. We also had Tuchel on our side who took off any kind of firepower Bayern had upfront to defend. We also had Musiala and Pavlovic who wasted time for us. More importantly, we had Neuer who spilled it to Joselu. Bayern got outplayed and out-thought by a great team, take it on the chin and move on. This is so unfair. This is so shitty. Pretty much everyone knows that Real were on top. But over and over the audience has been told that refs are instructed to keep their flags down to let the system do its work. More clear and obvious frustration from the public angry that the refs taint a perfectly good Semi-Final yeah blame the ref Good thing Bayern never gets ref help back in their own league… Dude added like 5 minutes after the 2 minutes he held up *after* the initial 9 minutes.   But we’re focused on one thing. Suddenly everybody forgets that the ref tried to disallow the goal from Joselu and that he agreed with VAR to overrule a foul. Plus 9 minutes suddenly become 14 minutes.  Bayern had the referee with them too. BVB is our last hope to save this sport 🧂 De Ligt is a terrible loser.  Try to stop Vinicius Jr better next time and shut up Salt is a way of life Embarrasing thing to say Cook them Ref had a great game until the end. Such a massive call. He’s right though. But tonight Tuchel and neuer lost the game. “I never just did things just to do them, come on. I menan, what am I gonna do? Just all of a sudden jump up and grind my feet on someone's couch, like it's something to do?” Then why did he add additional time for?? It was Bayern that did the time killing too at first. It’s ridiculous to blame the ref when the whistle already stopped the play And bayern don't, the hypocrisy of footballers mentality, lucky most of them have the millions earned from football to fall back on otherwise they'd be in dead end jobs first it was Rodrygo, now it’s Joselu transforming into a prime CR7 for 15 minutes. Shame that the referee bottle job is taking away from the rest of the match, and while Madrid certainly outplayed Bayern and deserved to go through, this isn’t the way a neutral like me would like to see it happen. I find it kind of funny how many people decried VAR after the Man U Cov VAR intervention, but this game has played out the natural way and people are desperate for VAR to have had a chance to intervene. I feel like all the aniVAR chat has made people forget what it's like for a ref to fuck the game and there be no backup from the tech. The most monied, self aggrandizing brittle club of them all? I'll bloody say it Ah.... yes...  the age old.....  When it hurts my opponents, it's just a honest mistake...or things happen, it's happening so fast the ref had to make a decision.    When it happens to us.... the ref was biased.... so yeah, Bayern can fuck off. Being a Real Madrid fan must be the most fun time ever Not only losers but also whiners engine office bag scandalous gullible nail fuzzy slim sheet drab   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Diddums. You got a penalty for this a few months ago:  https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30990382.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS311616541.jpg Funny they always seem to forget 1975 It was offsides Matthew anyway. Shut it. You guys bottled it. The people who say that this wouldn't have happened against Madrid, should probably go watch our last game against Valencia.  People need to turn off their emotions and turn on their brains. Tbh two mistakes were made firstly Lino putting his flag up straight away rather than after the play ended, secondly ref blowing as I feel he should be able to see it looked close and play on but if his audio from Lino says offside clear he will blow every time imo.  Tricky to say if they’d of scored as Real Madrid stopped on the whistle, looks like it might be offside by about 2cm so maybe not even a bad decision in the end.  I’d be blaming the brain dead manager taking off Kane, musiala is possibly forgivable as he had gone down before the sub (but this could also of been because of time wasting).   Also one of the worst FK ever at the end, straight to the RM GK and players not bunching up or neuer getting down there. Hahahaha what a baby. Bayern were way worse yesterday. Vinicius impregnated him and Kimmich. They get a goal up and then they sit back to watch Madrid  come at them. If it wasnt for Neuer game wouldve been over at the half. Ball went in after Madrid players stopped going for it because play was over. ANND A FULL 7 minutes past the original 9. Crazy. Just take the loss man, you were outclassed the whole game. the coping and blaming is honestly pretty cringe Tuchel made the difference. He's absolutely correct and good on him for calling it out. Asi asi asi gana madrid Wow, can’t believe all of the continuing whining from Bayern fans. When the whistle blew, RM stopped playing. If there was no whistle, that’s an easy save for the goalkeeper, even if they had actually gotten the shot off.  Stop blaming the officials, and instead blame your brain dead manager for his horrible substitutions.  I will add that I am a neutral observer here. Bayern tried to make a meal of a nothing situation in the arsenal game. They wanted a cheap penalty. Now they are making a meal out of a situation that was already called offside. The truth of the matter is that Real Madrid had the better chances in the game, played better overrall and won the game. Live with it. Note to self, being a sore loser and blaming people is really not a good look on anyone no matter what happened! helps no one and nothing Funny because everyone says that about Barcelona It's not a good look to be saying this but I don't blame him, I would probably say the same thing if I had scored a legal goal and the ref didn't even review it.   Not saying we were robbed but I can understand how he must be feeling like they were. Objectively Madrid were better and deserved to go through, but he's justified in his feelings. It was an offside. Linesman shouldn't put up the flag but you aint scoring that goal buddy if the ref didn't blow the whistle. Yes the refs so wanted to help us that they added 9 minutes of ET and then decided to signal that there would be 2 more minutes and then decided to add on another 3 minutes despite there being nearly no time wasting. The game should have ended a long time before that chance even happened. That was a shitty call. But seeing all these RM haters claim that Bayern would have won if the ref didn't blow the whistle is hilarious. We are not even sure it would've been a goal since our player and Luning would surely defend it. The VAR might rule it as offside (from the frames it looks 50/50). Even if they score, we will just go to extra time. Given their form and their subs, I don't see Bayern winning, in those remaining for +40mins Well, it was offside anyways. What’s the controversy? Cry me a river, mate Vini pocketed de light so bad today Whistle had blown.   Madrid guys stopped playing .   Would De Ligt scored if they defended then straight up???   We will never know The annoying thing is if he doesn't blow I think De Ligt just whacks the ball against the defenders leg and the play moves on. If the ref wanted Real Madrid to go through so badly he could've non-controversially blown the whistle to end the match at 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13 minutes. Real Madrid had 2.95 xG and Bayern had 0.35. How does he have the audacity to say that? You lost because Bayern was so shit. Enjoy the salt, we enjoy the success yeah, about time someone said it out loud Straight up pathetic to say that after how they played. Right on all counts. Another controversial decision towards Real Madrid during a CL semi-final? These are starting to get regular by now that you stop caring haha well, i’m sure there are other teams that feel the same, mate. Real <> CL — lethal combo of bad ref decisions I hate Real Madrid with every fibre of my body.  They’re worse than oil clubs, because while oil clubs buy players, Madrid buys referees.  Their fanbase consists of arrogant, plastic glory hunters.  They could sign the entire roster of Derby County and still cheat their way to multiple CL titles. Real Madrid is the bullshit that makes me not care about CL, you just know they will lie and cheat their way through with their ugly fallon'd floor football and blank kits not even the first massive mistake in favor of madrid in the ucl this season, don't forget vinicius getting away with a red against leipzig Madrid won the first 5 Champions League it’s their competition what did you expect I mean look back at their last few UCL wins, when did they not have a crazy decision go for them? Buddy de ligt the ref blew the whistle and the players stopped playing if he didnt the madrid players would have reacted and you would have not scored just accept defeat and you got outclassed all game Neuer made more of a difference than the referee. Dude, you have to put 8 past Madrid and still play like you are 2-0 down to win a UCL KO match in Bernabeu.  You scored only 1 and were expecting to win the match 🙄🙄 when scoring early against Madrid is well known as the surest way to lose the match. You need to learn the basics of your trade.  That goal would’ve only levelled the score line which would’ve made no difference. Those referees just spared you additional 30mins of agony. Crying baby lol. We also had Tuchel on our side tonight and Kane. I find the criticism in the comments funny. Like, it's not even an opinion, the ref OBJECTIVELY made a difference at the end. The facts that he had an otherwise great game, that Real Madrid is a deserved winner and that Bayern gave their lead away are all irrelevant to that. He's not wrong, that's pretty much all of Madrid's history.   Off the top of my head I can think of 3 champions leagues they wouldn't have won if it wasn't for refball.   At least those have the benefit of being before the VAR era but this is gonna leave a mark. Yep RM has been bribing the refs for a while now. We used to have them on our side but we ran out of money because Messis wages were too expensive How many times was Kane fouled? How many promising attacks did Real’s defense stop via misconducts? No yellow cards til the last minute. Rüdiger couldve been sent off for committing two of them.  It's such a shame that the miracoulous comeback they made is being overshadowed by a stupid mistake. Yes you give them that last breath by substituting off your record signing striker and signalling you're trying to play for the 3-2 rather than see out the game proactively. Wonder what the xG was this time Well that’s what happens in these stages. Teams with pedigree tend to get the favorable whistles from the refs. Real Madrid, literally UEFA enemy due to the Superleague, and some Bayern idiots think, UEFA would tell refereers to help Real Madrid on purpose. Yeah sure... Saying that as neutral, I don’t understand why such an uproar when it was actually an offside. Sure they blew the whistle too quickly and should have waited for it to play out but the end result would still be offside, no? Don't worry, Matthijs, we all saw it. Historic robbery. Another one. Corruption aside, Madrid honestly are the basic bitch of football clubs.  Such a boring, establishment wank fest that seems to have the most insufferably good luck in the history of the sport. Real Madrid have been so poor yet they get lucky. They should have never won the 2022 final either. Sidenote here. Although he is an immense defender and has a perfect personality, he will likely be benched this EC. I see Geertruida starting instead of him or even Timber when fit. If the nacho push wasn’t given as a foul then I’d say something but this seems like an honest mistake. How are they crying when the ref disallowed a good Madrid goal because one of their defenders dived Anyone with eyes who isn’t a Real Madrid basic can see how the ref always tilts games in their favour. There called Vardrid for a reason. sour grapes Right decision after all, i understand all the criticism n' controversy but the outcome would be the same. De ligt complaining about a goal he scored AFTER the whistle that made all Madrid player stop playing. Bayern played like shit, if we are gonna be honest. Madrid dominated the match and got rewarded for it [removed] I'm here for it, Xavi's shitty 2000s haircut and his crying keep me alive. Xavi has the tact of [Kanye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1gWIRhoZ4E) lmao and can we have Rafa Benitez back him up with ""Ze Faxchts"" 2009 Champions League semi-final enters the chat. This is it. This is the comment of the night. Barça ends the league in 3rd place, would it still be because the refs were siding with Real? No wonder so many GOATs congregate around it. Kinda stupid tho And bayern fans love madrid fans, hmm guess you dont have a problem with that team When Bayern keeps getting robbed no shit What a glorious time to be alive [deleted] Yet their fans want to chant puta Barca together in the first leg 🤷🏾‍♂️ Fuck controversy, it produces memorable matches and peak football that we remember for our entire life, I love to play against you guys Thats the stupid thing. Has anybody seen drawn lines? Are we for certain that the Munich players were onside?  I'm not trying to absolve the referee because that was very close and deserved a real VAR check. I was a ref and people have to realise how much concentration it takes and how difficult it is to sustain that concentration for over 90 minutes. It was a big mistake, but 'easily aboidable' is an odd choice of words in my view.  It's like saying Neuer's mistake was 'easily avoidable'. I agree that it's a shame, but it's really a part of the game Dude brought it upon himself, could have easily ended the game earlier or hold the whistle until the end of the play Can we please also talk about the fact, that it was probably the right call anyway? A huge mistake obviously, but I don’t know that it’s avoidable. It’s a brain fart, the mans reffed for years and it’s only been in the last few that the linesmen have been instructed to hold the flag.   True, random mistakes are unavoidable. linesmans have been holding their flags even for clear off sides for the last 5 years. whys this guy different I get the offsite thing but nacho not seeing a freaking red card for actively pushing Kimich against his throat is still beyond me. Was way worse than the offsite decision imho The ref already made the mistake of allowing the 9 minutes of extra time to turn into 15 minutes. I think it’s on the linesman more than the ref. They’re told not to put the flag up unless it’s clear and obvious. If the lino puts the flag up then the ref must think it’s clear and obvious. You guys would be the best refs in the world Just like Neuer. Calling it a „mistake“ is downplaying it Players kept going down so he had to. I still maintain the extra time at the world cup was brilliant because all the usual tactics for wasting time got added.  Honestly it's simply time for effective playing time or whatever it's called when the clock is stopped whenever play stops Yes, thats true, he made a clear ""two more"" sign at 9 minutes, he then let the clock run to 14. In fairness a lot of people don’t know that added time is always a *minimum* Also, when he showed camavinga the yellow during the last minutes, he didnt make everyone wait for him to write it down. Just showed him a quick yellow and continued. Despite the last error, he is a very good ref There should be a big counter on every stadium for everyone to see the actual running game time. That way people would actually start to appreciate the referees that don’t play along with some players antics and finally can start to demand their money’s worth in actual football instead of seeing some prima donna on the ground for half the game time. There are matches were actual run time is like 60mins, a whole half hour of wasted time because of shady antics and tactics. Credit to him for that.  I hate seeing half of stoppage time wasted and then not added on.  I also don't really blame him for the whistle as I thought the linesmen have been directed to keep their flags down and then raise them after the play.  At least that is all I remember since VAR has been introduced.  Though I've seen people placing blame on both of them so now I'm not as sure. I saw them do the same during Copa América but they used the stoppage time board. Not sure why that hasn't caught in Europe. You shouldn't be penalized for a goal/sub/injury/VAR review took place during stoppage time. The referee was absolutely amazing this game.. Its a shame that 1 single (but extremely huge) mistake overshadows his performance. Imaging if it was Real Madrid the one who scored in the 90+9+2+3 minute. People in this sub will be saying the ref was bought by Real Madrid for allowing the game to continue until they score. It happens all the time, when there is an interruption during added time and they add on more. How have you never seen that before They should just stop the clock whenever play is stopped. This would solve all the time wasting crap people are pulling. And people will still insult him after this game. I fell in love with this ref, he let the game flow and was fair in every play. I agree that the last play shouldn't have been blown that early but one mistake in 115 minutes is completely normal. And the way Bayern bottled the 3 v 1 situation.. make me feel a bit better as Liverpool fan Not the first time for Bayern either Yeah but momentum is huge in football, bayern equaliser and then the game flips  Yeah, shades of the 2017 match between the two where Hummels looked like he was about to disintegrate. I will remember it for Tuchel's bizarre substitutions It won't be remembered for it.   It might have made a difference, which we don't even know (was it offside? Would it have gone in? Would Bayern have gone through even then? Lots of ifs) but it was a single mistake and ultimately the result that reflects the game as well.    People remember horrible shitshows, but something like this is easily forgotten by the vast majority who will just remember the game for a bit, then the scoreline, and eventually it all fades into obscurity lmao every ref of the last 5 years lets that play on, why did the linesman, and ref, stop the play... makes no sense No one cares after a couple of years. Tell me who even brings up the offside goal in the CL final between Atletico and Madrid. It doesn't come up, and even if does your a whiny bitch that just needs to accept it. Eventually all that people remember is the win. Especially people that aren't a fan of 1 of the 2 teams that are playing. The defence and goalkeeper stopped, when the referee whistled. Imo would not have been a goal. Lunin would have saved that easily. Big referee mistanke, but no goal. ""mistake"" Sané is getting a lot of heat, but I gotta say that he should be absolved from criticism. He's injured, he's been nursing a pubic bone inflammation for months and has been enduring incredible pain just to be on the pitch in the last weeks. His attitude has always been put into question, and rightfully so in the past. But this year, he's given it all, even though it wasn't pretty in the end.  Kimmich on the other hand was just diabolical. Man, some of those Bayern attacks and counters were shocking lol. Like watching a League 2 team trying Don’t forget Neuer!  It’s impressive that Ulreichs mistake back in 2017 (I think) is now the 2nd most consequential mistake from a Bayern goalkeeper against Real Madrid. I wouldnt blame Kimmich, thats like blaming Boateng for 2015. He just got an generational player on his best day in front of him and had no help, same thing happened to Yan Couto, Araújo, Alexander-Arnold and so on... Lmfao 😭 They were so bad 😭 Dont forget Kim Also Kim. He was the key sub you can go fuck yourself  and your super league. I hope you  burn in hell This is where Kane truly shines! Yeah it’s just human error. Wouldn‘t want to be him right now, apparently apologized to players. It's the football fan special. Refs are shit, but anytime a ref makes a mistake it's not because he made a mistake but because there is some grand conspiracy going on for whatever team got the favourable call. Also they had so many goals ruled out. As a Bayern fan, it sucks but it is what it is. Wasn’t a for sure goal since the defenders stopped playing as you said, but would’ve been a good goal scoring chance. I put this on us for Tuchel deciding to take off all our dangerous attacking threats to protect a one goal lead with 15 minutes left. Plus, the Neuer mistake even though I am not mad at him since he kept us in the game with numerous excellent stops beforehand. The centerback literally lifted his leg to contest the shot. Barca scored a goal in a similar situation a year or two back in a Classico. Defenders shouldn't switch off at the flag but rather wait for the whistle. I said to my friends:  ""Tuchel is doing a Simeone, you don't sub your forwards against RM with at least 10 minutes of play.""  Fast forward....goal. That's just a stupid argument, it doesn't matter what would have happened, a bad call is a bad call Who is upvoting this shit? reddit is such a shit place for having actual incels and football incels here to comment, when they should have no reason to do so. They should rather start living or at least try to get off the couch and experiece how a football actually feels like. Bayern fans totally have a reason to be mad, I would be as well, but I feel like so many ppl are acting like if the ref didn’t botch that call we’d be in extra time right now. It would’ve been a definite *goal chance* but not a definite *goal*. There’s a big difference there Trophies are remembered, refs aren't. Completely deserved is a bit much - Bayern had some good chances as well When you put it like that then it not deserved isnt’t it deserved...lol...by what measure? $ spent on refs? Both linesmen fucked up right? They raised it for Real Madrids second goal as well. The difference is that the ref didn't have time to blow before the ball was in the net when Madrid scored. It’s not just on the linemen, the main ref can also choose to ignore the flag and continue the play but he also chooses to blow the whistle while it’s still in play. The buck stops with the ref he didn't need to whistle.  He had a fine game in general (unless people want to get picky about a couple of yellows including one that's not subjective) but like Neuer the mistake is the key moment. > The linesman should totally be sanctioned though  How much are you willing to bet that it was offside? How sure are you? > The linesman should totally be sanctioned though, can't make these kind of mistakes in such an important game  As if that made any difference. Idiot... There really isn't an excuse, excuses cannot hide no trophies this season. At some point you have to look inside This They absolutely will and it's already starting. It wasn’t the same situation though. Madrid players stopped defending after the whistle.         You all got denied a chance, not a goal. Tuchel came out to play for a draw and the subs once Bayern scored were horrible. Bottom of the La Liga shows more balls against us than Bayern did today I thought Bayern were better in the 1st leg but Madrid made it 2-2. That’s football You're away in Madrid so the chances of out playing Real were low but your goal was much better and you weren't awful. Tuchels subs were so terrible, why take out Kane and Musiala… however the call at the end of the game can not be over looked. Straight robbery.9 > We did not deserve to win  I mean, you were far better in the first leg but still gifted 2 goals to Madrid and you only lost tonight because of Neuer's mistake (and this ref decision didn't help either). or the ref fucking up big time... Real actually won a champions league game where they had more possession and more scoring opportunities (I’m assuming) That doesn't always matter though, does it? City were the better side in both legs and still lost Better by a mile is an absolute stretch. It took a Neuer howler for them to even get back in it. by a mile? don't be so biased I think you being blind is what made the difference. Congrats... And paying the refs also helps One bad ref call doesn't eliminate us dominating them that game Bayern didn't attack or defend very well Neur kept them in the game till he fumbled the first goal people are blaming him but without him that game would of been like 3-1 or 4-1 lmao [removed] He did say that in the full interview. ""Real played well and deserves to be in the final"". This is just Romano with his clickbait shit picking apart sentences. How is that a bad excuse? If it wasn’t offside they were pretty much robbed of a goal or at least a goal scoring chance. If that goal had counted maybe we’d be talking about Madrid bottling it in the last minute. I am also so disappointed. This play is removing the focus from another amazing “comeback”   We will never know what would have happened with this play if Real Madrid players did not stopped playing after whistle. Even it could be an offside.  Just let it play. Worst case scenario for us as madridista is extra time of an incredible game Agree with all that you said but us Madrid fans shouldn't talk about ""deserving to win"" , we have won championship against the tide where everyone said we didn't deserve to win . > The ref should have ended the match already,  I strongly disagree here, the VAT and the celebrations were between 4 & 5 mins and then several RM players suddenly had the same health issues, Bayern players had before, I actually think, that the extra time given was very appropriate. wheres the fun in that The dream of a German team in Europe. Welcome to the club! I think sub has been alright tbh. Understandable the goal is talked about and I'm curious to see if it was actually offside or not maybe uefa will tell us Barca fans out their caves Regular reaction to a Real Madrid win around here tbf. Denied of a clear goal scoring opportunity in the last minute. Are you dense? I knew right then that it will be the only thing everyone talks about. The ball was in the goal and the offsides was within .25m…. What are you talking about? Where was VAR…. That part of the quote isn’t what gets the people going though “No! Not like that!”  -Neuer with his hand up Well you pay the ref great amounts Sorry that you seem so offended as part of the ref team Tbf Madrid parked the bus against City too for most of the game. That time it worked and this time it didn’t You deserved to win but Bayern didn't get outplayed lmao  Real Madrid fans are something else lol Fam it's Real not Leipzig They'll either get crushed or play a close game and get fucked by the refs. Grow up, the ref made a massive mistake blowing before play is over when VAR exists. I'd be extremely pissed off. And you wouldn’t be if you were him? I'd love to see your reaction if the plays were reversed and this was let play out for a goal and Joselu's second was prematurely called dead for an incorrect offside. Well it’s true so not really Tbf can you cook them? They are in a CL final. Everyone will forget about this after a while. He can do it from his sofa at home while he watches the final Worry about not getting relegated to 3. Liga… Play was whistled before the goal so it can't be reviewed. It's a inexcusable mistake from the linesman, but it can't be a ""legal goal"" when play has been whistled and some of the players have stopped playing(inc. goalkeeper).   It might have been offside(it's very close), Nacho could have intercepted the pass to de light (seems like he pulls out of a challenge because of the whistle) and also Lunin definitely stopped playing so it could have been saved.   So it's really pointless to call it a ""robbed goal"", too many variables which could have gone either way. You would bloody cry if you got robbed like this today. No one are more cry babies than Madrid fans Embarrassing success when you need the ref How did they play? You're plastic as well though tbh The moment the ref decided to continuously add more and more time to the game was the moment he made a difference. Speak for yourself.  I saw 5 minutes added on top of added time for no reason and a ""goal"" scored after a whistle and after players stopped playing. r/soccer user try not to exaggerate challenge (impossible) Because Real Madrid was so poor that expected goals was 3.3-0.41? I hope he's benched as well, but that's because he's a mediocre defender with a shitty personality. And before Timber or Geertruida are even considered we already have Virgil and De Vrij as better options at CB. [deleted] Refs literally admitting they made a mistake (it's actually mistakes in plural, because that 2 balls on the pitch situation was a major fuck up as well) and you say ""sour grapes"". Is there any logic left in your brain? Jamie, can you pull it up? https://i.eurosport.com/2019/01/09/2496313-51824986-310-310.png Shitty 2000’s haircut 💀 All he's missing is the frosted tips The Hispanic dad special You have a raging hate boner for Xavi. Get a life looks like Xavi has broken your heart many times! off this much hate Bro looks like he listens to smash mouth all day What a sad life you have Ich schwöre, der Bre braucht Seiten auf 0. The haircut! That might be it! If Pep hadn't lost his hair and wasn't forced to move on from the past he might have not been as inventive? Xavi is stuck in the past with his hair. Wow, the comments section is vile on that link you shared. idk why people are acting like the goal was certain. Yea it was a fuck up but de ligt and (i think muller?) both had players infront of them who immediately stopped play. Its questionable whether he would even have been able to get the shot off in the first place. I'm pretty certain some of you don't watch the games, just keep turning up around for the twitter drama. It's easy to say that when every controversy is in favor of your team. [removed] >and deserved a real VAR check  Then it's on the referee for not stopping the play and letting VAR take a look at it All these statements are true:  - ref should have let the play and recheck with var - bayern might be offside - even if bayern was onside, anyone honest would have noticed that most madrid players actually stopped playing due to the whistle hence the ""goal"". If there was no whistle it is very probable that there is no goal looking at the players positioning.  People are right to be frustrated with the whistle though, since now everyone is just speculating on offside/onside vs goal/ no goal https://twitter.com/ArchivoVAR/status/1788323086216896948?t=V6xTOeUDBbfCxlAp_tSYfA They were offside man dont understand all the anger They were offside lol  And the defence stopped when the whistle blew  Yes the refs are shit and yes it was a cock-up but people are clinging to this like a liferaft lol, Madrid just Madrided again For me this is pointless anyway because it’s clear that the defenders and goalkeeper do not attempt to defend/save as soon as they hear the whistle. So we’ll never know where the ball would have ended up if the whistle didn’t blow anyway. Marzoui who played the ball was onside From the lines Mazraoui is on but de ligt is off. I’m not sure if it could be argued that de ligt initially goes for the ball and affects play cause he drags rudiger with him but in any case they should have let it play on. I’m fairly confident the Madrid defense would have dealt with it anyway had they not stopped at the whistle They broadcasted it later and it was onside - very very close It does not matter. It was super close and every non-partial ref would have let the game play on. The point of the whole issue is that the referee stopped play immediately without letting it go on and then checking VAR after. Yeah Bayern scored on this play, but the Madrid players also stopped defending because they heard the whistle. Play should’ve continued until at least the shot was taken. It was offside knee was like half a meter stretched. No one would care though. They have their agenda. I believe refs old habits and instinct took over. He knows he should have waited, but that was a reaction, an unconscious one. It was easily avoidable because he didn’t have to make any call there really, the linesman I mean. How often do we see them let play go forever and then call it way back. One of the big reasons for VAR was to allow the linesman to let the close ones like that to play out. And yet we insist on the refs having to also keep track of time in a game where time wasting is a huge issue. The refs can barely manage reffing the actual game. It makes no sense why they can’t just stop the clock. Being a referee must be one of the most difficult jobs in the world, people really have no sympathy But this is the second leg of a champions league semi. Mistakes from a refereeing body at this level are simply not acceptable regardless of how acceptable it should be to make mistakes.   The consequence of a player making a mistake if them affecting their team.   The consequences of a referee making a mistake is them affecting the competition itself. Been a ref for 20 years. At his level he shouldn’t blow his whistle like that Not letting the play develop in the last minute of a UCL semi-final is an unforgivable mistake. He shouldn't be refereeing these matches if he makes a mistake like this.  Honestly, not letting a play develop that's this close to a shot on goal when there's a VAR is always a ridiculous mistake. It's the easiest thing in reffing these days: just let the play develop for a little bit to see if it results in a goal. Even if it's a clear offside, because I've seen linesmen be wrong on clear onside/offside too. How is this not easily avoidable? If it's hard to focus for that long, default to doing nothing. Actually would have been a better outcome of the linesman closed his eyes and took a nap. Honestly, how easily avoidable do you want it to be. Maybe make it so linesman don't even call offside anymore. Just take it away from them and let VAR just always deal with offside. Linesman is just for corners, free throw and fouls. VAR is supposed to eliminate ‘probably’ Just seen an angle where they drew the offside line on TV and it would have been onside. So the linesman was wrong. I don’t know from the freeze frame.  He looks level.  Maybe on by a hair maybe off by a hair.  We will never know as they never put lines in it.  I would say it was possibly the right call, not probably. 'Probably' is the key word. We can be sure but the call now is 'Probably' But it wasn’t. The player who received the ball was in an onsides position No. He fucked up, the linesman fucked up even more and they should have let them play it out. Doesn't matter if the knee was millimeters offside, they need to follow the fucking rules. Can we also add the fact that the players stopped playing when the ref blew the whistle which would mean that it wouldn't most likely be a goal if the players didn't stop playing because of refs whistle. So many kids are acting like that  ""offside"" is a goal. No. Why would it be the right call? There’s also no saying they would’ve scored, Madrid players stopped playing after he blew the whistle for a few seconds before de ligts shot Was it though? He looked onside to me. It wasn’t. The play was clearly onside. Seemed onside to me when rewinding and pausing What? He was 100% onside It was a right call but it was in favour of real so it's always questionable... Except it wasn't the right call, lines have been drawn already by many people That’s not a fact. Every reply I saw it looked onside Probably. The assistent also thought it was the right call to flag voor offside when joselu scored his second goal.. No, because we don't know for sure. That's the whole point of this debacle [deleted] Yep, they did this for a brief period in the Premier League and everybody lost their shit (primarily the gammons). If 90 mins is too long then just shorten to match length to 80 or whatever. This constant time wasting is embarrassing to the sport.  Yeah, this is the way it should be everywhere. It's not hard to fucking keep time while play is stopped and just add it on at the end. It would make the games a lot fairer.  Maybe it's all related to TV ... > I still maintain the extra time at the world cup was brilliant because all the usual tactics for wasting time got added.   They still didn't. It wasn't accurate, and you can see that on the net play time. Even within a short tournament it _started_ being relatively good and then it wasn't anymore.  And still only added like 3 or 4 minutes more to the total average than you would have normally. It wasn't even full 60 minutes per game of net time played.  The only way to be accurate and consistent across _all_ games and all teams through the season, is start-stop clock (of two 30 min halves to make it reflective of the current play time). > I still maintain the extra time at the world cup was brilliant because all the usual tactics for wasting time got added.  Jup thats the 1 thing I liked about the WC. No. This will decimate the sport. It's not compatible with soccer at top level. Too costly to implement in amateur/youth football and imo too big of a deal to only do it in pro football. He made the “2” sign at at 10 minutes, he also said 2 minutes before Jude went down and got subbed off and rudiger fell to the ground… that is literally time wasting and the ref can add whatever he wants, you are also forgetting the multiple fouls. Bench clearing goal celebration was at least 2 minutes Not really, many times the match ends a few seconds before the extra time. No they wouldn't. The ref did an amazing job aside from that last call, which really mostly is on the linesperson. The flag should have stayed down. Probably not scoring anyway, but it would have been an amazing finish if he did (for myself and other neutrals). Of course you pass it as normal when your side massively benefitted from that mistake Real had a young upcoming midfielder who ran the entire field back to get to the ball first too lol That counter almost made me more angry than the ref decision at the end.  Müller just totally botched the easiest pass there. Reminded me of [that counter](https://youtu.be/3urrelT3_hI?si=2sNGznZYYO5KeHJI) vs. England at the last EUROs.... To be fair, Bayern squad is injured, Tuchel not resting key players in the weekends... they were gassed at that point. Naw. With Sane, Musiala and Kane out i doubt they wouldve made it thru Momentum is so huge RM (and many other teams) has shat on it consistently. Just the previous round when City equalised...momentum did nothing for them.  Bayern equalizes and they still spend the next 30 minutes in their own box. Bayern literally did nothing but one banger shot. And actively played like cowards trying to kill time. The game should’ve been over way before that too Only Madrid created those momentum Equalizing when Real Player stopped because the ref told them? I’ll remember it more for one of the GOAT goalkeepers making a massive mistake that flipped the game on its head than reffing decisions or substitutions They felt like errors at the time, I don't know if any of them were due to injury/being knackered but it's like he forgot that they might need to score again. He only subbed injured players, what do you even mean He had too because the players were dead  Thats what tuchel doing. he is diverting attention from it. You really think you can go and play against the most famous champions league team, famous for their late comebacks, at their home, leading by a goal when they should be comftably up by 3 and you think you can kill the game and not park the bus?  The fuck are you people on? Everyone always exaggerates how impactful the online reaction to something is. Reality is that it will be forgotten soon like you said (except by Bayern fans I’m sure). This is the same fixture in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored (possibly twice) while being offsides in 2017. One of the major incidents that led to the implementation (or at least acceptance) of VAR in the champions league. I'm not sure how many people will forget this...  Edit: many comments ""oh but you forgot these other details""  - you all have great memories for people who are sure to forget this ever happened. That’s true but I imagine this will be another instance that feeds into the narrative that Madrid get favourable treatment from refs. Maybe but this is as big an error as your get given the timing and the stakes. Let me guess, Madrid paid the ref? He literally has to stay on the pitch at halftime and keep himself warm, so the pain doesn't come back. Kimmich was going up against the best player on the field. It takes about 2 players to stop Vinicius so I can't fault him for that. >He's injured, he's been nursing a pubic bone inflammation for months and has been enduring incredible pain just to be on the pitch in the last weeks.     Incredible how these people never learn, a chronic Pubic injury is exactly what killed Kaká's carreer. He already looked done in his last season for Milan. He shouldnt play then, if a player has to play thru such pain that they make no impact on the game, sit it out. Playing Kimmich at RB against vini was the real diabolical choice. Then dont play him Kimmich is a slow player for a right back, being put against Vinicius was almost certainly going to backfire Also his goal last week completely changed that game, and probably this one as well. And it was all him. i was sad to see gnabry go off. i really think he is a great player Sane gave the ball away in the first 12 seconds of the game and looked indifferent about it. I knew then he'd have a stinker. Bellingham was playing through injury too No one has any pace so rudiger who has decent speed and Mendy did well Poor guy put In one of the all time goalkeeping performances just to spill the easiest catch of his career. He played incredibly well tbf  Until the 88th min Bayern probably wouldn't even have a lead to begin with, if not for neuer. I honestly feel for Neuer. Man was incredible and easy MOTM and then one mistake…that’s the beauty of the game tho I’ll say Upamecano last year, Kim in the first leg, Neuer tonight. Bayern keep losing to themselves in the CL He looked amazing until that silly mistake which a keeper with his experience shouldn’t make tbh Neuer saved at least 2 99% goals in my opinion. Madrid eliminated Bayern, have you heard? It was also a combination of the ref and the linesperson. Sucks, but we've all seen way worse mistakes and Madrid let up after the whistle, so who knows if a goal even occurs. Overall, the officiating was pretty good.  edit: What was a bigger mistake for me were the Bayern subs. WTF? It's the shitting on referees in general, from grassroots levels up that makes the game look bad.    I have done my fair share of complaining to the referee in our sunday league games, but it should change. Referees are too easy a target. They're alone, you have a crowd. There should be a campaign for respect towards referees. They are an element of the game, whether we like it or not.  I mean I agree that this was just a genuine bad call, but come on are you seriously saying your club (and mine as well) are never favored by the ref and it's all conspiracy? Did you watch your game against Leipzig? Apparently he took them off because of injuries  That’s the issue no? Ref whistled so Madrid defenders stopped playing   ""Tuchel is doing a Simeone, you don't sub your forwards against ~~RM~~ <insert literally anyone> with at least 10 minutes of play.""  I thought he did well this tie otherwise, but that Kane sub is just really hard to understand He chose not to do this in 2022 against Madrid and lost. He chose to do it tonight and lost (largely due to the Neuer error).  People need to stop with this results-based analysis lol Simeone would've won tho. That's the problem. Madrid players stop playing because of the whistle while Bayern do not and they score. Could the goal have been prevented if Rudiger, Lunin etc. were still playing? No one knows It's honestly crazy seeing all these Bayern fans act like they had won the game except for that call. [deleted] and you are the one that says it most probably would have not been a goal? Because otherwise you are making a fool out of yourself right now.. Unless you are Collina Even as a Bayern fan I have to say that Madrid deserved it more. How is it possible that Davies was our best attacking player today?? Just an overall disappointing performance from our forwards. Madrid (2.92) - (0.38) Bayern according to Fotmob  5 big chances vs 0 big chances  Madrid were definitely more dominant today Bayern had 0 big chances, we had 5. 2.9 xg vs 0,3. 19 shots to 8. We completely deserved it. Madrid had 2x more shots than Bayern. Tell me who deserved to win. How does it mean it was not deserved from the statement he made? How tf it's not deserved lol, you're absolutely tripping Oh its you again. Back to working commenting overtime? How is the ref gonna know the linesman made a terrible call though, normally they dont raise the flag unless its like 5 meter offside. I don’t know in Champions league but usually the linesman keeps his flag down until the play is complete, only raising it immediately if they are certain of the call So many excuses while three defenders and Lunin stopped playing. Of course, but I'm saying that the referee did the correct thing for one situation (only calling offside AFTER the play had finished), but the wrong for another (calling offside and ending play when the chance could lead to a goal) If it was onside that is, from the replay it is very tight. People just assuming that they were onside and calling it a robbery A chance is still a possibility for a goal, even if the ref whistled and the player had a terrible probability to score. He still has the right to complain. Ofc you say that. Would u say the same in reverse? Watched scene 100x times. No defense attempt sfter whistle would have denied the goal Well from the clips I saw after the game (to analyze them a bit) the whistle just comes when de Ligt actually shoots so you can't really say they stopped defending after the whistle.  Anyways still a clear chance that got denied. A negative mentality like this does not suit us, no disagreement from me Isn't that excactly what Ancelotti did against City in the quarters though? Madrid sits back against City every season lmao Real does this every single year so not sure what you're on about lmfao  You won the CL a couple years ago despite being the worse team in every single knockout tie. Not to mention the way you played in the first leg is even worse than what Bayern did tonight Neuer's mistake came after more than enough chances where Real should've scored and a disallowed goal off of a foul that had nothing to do with the play. We did not 'only' lose tonight because of Neuer's mistake. We lost tonight because Tuchel decided we should play like a relegation team fighting for some points. Davies very randomly scoring a ridiculous goal after being subpar all season does not mean we did anything right tactically They weren't ""far better"" in the 1st leg though. Don't know what game people really saw. You do know that it would have been extra time and not a Bayern win right? And he only got a chance at  a free volley because the play was dead. 19 shots, 7 on target vs 8 shots, 5 on target.  Definitely more. I was so hyped until the 87th minute, ready to yell that we did a real madrid to real madrid, and the neuer mistake happened. Real def played better today Neuer superman levels of saving was the reason Real wasn't up 4 in the first place. 2.92 xG vs 0.38 xG is an absolute stretch now huh It's just results-based analysis on this sub. Tuchel is ""shit"" because of his subs even though they were 5 minutes and a Neuer howler away from going to the final 2.9 xg vs 0.3 Barca was knocked out of the CL? aw Shut yo bitch ass up. Next time act like a fucking adult and bring an argument forward instead of insults  Okay, obviously they shouldn't let it go. But it was an awful performance by Bayern, I don't like when players talking like this after playing horribly. We scored the Joselu goal at 90:01, VAR gave the goal at 91:21. Where the hell do you get 4-5 minutes from?? PSG fans making their subreddit public again... If the ref had not blow the whistle, probably It would have not been a ""clear goal scoring opportunity"", thats the whole point of this Mess. At 90+14 after only giving 90+9.  The game should have been long over by then. Clear?? Already whistled to stop play and Madrid players stopped defending. Stop acting like you were robbed. We won clearly fairly and just. You are dense, 9th minute added time then ref shows two more but lets play for 5 more cmon now. It's Reddit lad what do you expect Because it taints an amazing game [deleted] The play was stopped a couple seconds before De Ligts scored if you haven't noticed. We probably paid tuchel to play for a draw. Probably also paid the Bayern players to pretend it was over start time wasting. Enjoying these comments lol ya never learn Just lmao It's going to be controversial but I'd rather see a can club like Leipzig win it fair (on the pitch at least) than another CL tainted by refereeing issues. 🎣 No because they wasted their time on the floor lol. Holding a 1-0 to Madrid is just plain stupid. Clearly offside on De Ligt. He also obviously affects play by just being there. Surely he has conference league football or something to watch Chelsea in?  Sure, bud. Whatever floats your boat How?  I’ve supported Bayern since I was a kid. People say that regardless if VAR was used or not when the refs cheat for Madrid. Enjoy your tainted victory. poor poor baby. just cry it out Xavi ""NSYNC"" Hernandez Maybe if he got rid of that old Yee-yee ass haircut .. impressive he’s never once thought… “maybe i’ll get a new look?”  his barber must be so boring He literally told you that his hate is the only thing keeping him alive. Some people just don't have too much to live for tbh. I think it’s amusing tbh. You gotta have some fun Bro hates Xavi more than Kendrick hates Drake  💀 [deleted] Show us how you have a life I disagree. It's awesome. Even as a little kid, I knew that haircut was classless. So what mate what is this argument? There was a BIG POSSIBILITY for a goal that is wrongly caled offside (it should have been played on for VAR) in the 90+s of a champions league semi final. You expect nobody to talk about that and for this not to be a controversy? Yea and the keeper could have saved it, it’s really not as a big of a deal as it seems but is still shitty. However it shouldn’t have gotten to 90+13 Just breath bro, pain will be over soon Okay it’s not that *undeep* Whats with the anger VAR cannot intervene and award the goal once we got to that point Honestly, the referee is only as good as the assistants and the assistants are the ones that raise the flag too early. Sure, if the whistle hadn't already been blown. Too late at that point. That image is terrible since the marks they are using are wrong. You cant even see Rudiger's boog there. Thanks https://i.imgur.com/847wf8W.png Whether or not he was off it was not half a meter. It was a centimeter either way. Lol, he wasn’t offside, people have already analyzed it and he was onside. But it isn’t given that they would have scored if the ref didn’t blow the whistle, as the players stopped playing. Honestly if he just ends the game when he should have this would all be null. Good luck finding a person who can’t make mistakes! Especially with something as difficult and subjective as refereeing. Well yeah, I know that, you know that, he knows that... Again, it's a mistake. At pro level players shouldn't miss sitters and yet we see those mistakes regularly. Yeah, we saw how well that works in the past. 😂 I do think he was onside but lines drawn by a broadcaster won't necessarily produce the same result as VAR analysis in a close play It’s moot cause the whistle is gone. The referee blowing is the mistake, not the fact the goal wasn’t given. CBS showed it in detail. He was absolutely on, not even a question. [deleted] Because it is. I'm 110% pro Bayern here but yeah, they do stop for a second there, allowing de Ligt to get a clean shot. If play goes on, that's probably blocked.  Sucks to have this mistake overshadow the game. [deleted] I never said it is a fact. I used ""fact"" as in ""circumstance"", how is this hard to understand? Lol bro Real second goal was a vastly different affair Come on, at the 2nd Goal for Real Madrid Joselu was the one deemed to be offside, and he scored less than half a second later. On the Bayern goal, the referee blew before Müller hit the ball, and he headed it to de Ligt who scored. There was no time to even let the ball play on Real Madrids goal. The PL refs have zero balls to stick to anything >This constant time wasting is embarrassing to the sport.  It ruins the end of pretty much every game for someone like me. Fake injuries. Goalies laying on the ball and then pacing with it for like 20 seconds. Lazily walking to the sideline when you're subbed out. Subs at all lol. Along with the absurd flopping, it kills the watchability of the sport.  My only real suggestion would be an *immediate* red card for obvious time-wasting. No warning. You kick a dead ball away from the other team in the 92nd minute? **Red card.**  But the obvious problem is fake 'injuries' where you don't *really* know if they are fake. I'm not sure how to deal with that. shortening the match length wouldn't do anything, whatever team has the lead (or draw if they're happy with that) is incentivized to use time-wasting tactics.  this will persist as long as the tactic is effective and the punishment isn't severe enough. they could either make it less effective, by more accurately adding the time wasted back on, like they did at the WC, or increase the punishment severity or frequency. Right now players rarely get carded, unless it's really blatant or repeat offenses by the same player.  I'd like to see them try sin bins tbh, but it would need testing in youth level or smaller leagues before trying in the top leagues. They're still doing aren't they? I hardly ever see added time of less than 5 mins now What do you mean? They still do it in the premier league it would be easily over with switching to like 30min halfs and time stopped like in basketball, handball, american football,… I wouldn’t be opposed to using a stop/start clock and ending the game immediately when it’s supposed to. > If 90 mins is too long then just shorten to match length to 80 or whatever  Terrible idea timekeeping in football should be done just like it is in handball: ball is not in play / players are blatantly time-wasting etc - you just stop the clock, and resume it whenever restarts Why? Yeah it's not like basketball uses it from 6year olds up to nba. How is it too costly? All the ref needs is a clock that they can stop? The ref made the right call with the added time. I was expecting 10+ minutes after Bayern started going down for every little thing. It was a good call, much better than other refs who ended games while a player was still in the action and scored a goal, that he didn't count. Roughly 101 minutes into the match actually. The first 4 minutes of the 9 went into VAR checks and celebrations, then he adds other delays to the 9 so calling it about 104 makes total sense. I was pleased with that because in that one Madrid overtime game a couple of years ago, they just decided that no football will be played in the last 5 minutes, and the referee went with it.    I also think that tactical substitutions shouldn't be allowed in added time.  [deleted] He might really become something when he grows up Who was that? I missed the moment Imagine doubting eric goato-goating Müller is always good for a surprise, but that would have needed to be the one saving grace. I'd have bet my life savings on Madrid in extra time even though I'm more sympathetic towards Bayern Bayern didn't have any viable attack threat on field anymore as well Real did the same against City. It's a tactic that I personally also don't like, however it's a way of winning as well. Two things can be true, Bayern can play terribly and the call can also be shit whether or not they deserve the win. Sad because Neuer had an INCREDIBLE night for 88 minutes. I’m not even particularly a Neuer fan, but really truly that mistake cost them the game. Real were done and dusted Almost all were. Gnabry obviously injured and Musiala/Sane haven't played bundesliga football in weeks because they are injured and just try to go as long as they can in the CL. The only sub which wasn't clear whether it was for injury/exhaustion was Kane very late Kane wasn't injured That is the unfortunate truth. To this day i still remember van persie red card against barcelona as one of the most suspicious and controversial moment in history.  But not many young fans remember or know this. Bayern fans wanted their 90+9+2+4 minute goal to count even when the ref whistle made Real Madrid players stop and don’t even try to stop the shot. Well, people seems to forget that the goal that even got Bayern to extra time was offside. Also people seem to forget the completely BS penalty Bayern got in the first leg. Yes. Vidal hit the moon. But it was still a wrong call that people seem to completely disregard And this is the same fixture where that tie never should've went to extra time as Lewa was offside on the Ramos-own goal that had the game go into extra time in the first place. Or that Bayern got a pen at 1-0 in the first leg for a ball that hit Carvajal in the chest. (Vidal missed the pen)  But I guess that doesn't fit the narrative. Its been 20 years, mate. Its not Christiano. Its Cristiano. That fixture was riddled with bad decisions on both sides, though. Even then, I don't hear a lot of people bringing this up.   Most people do in fact forget the little intricacies and could haves and would haves. The fans who feel hard done by it and a minority of neutrals may not, but most do. Even then, this incident is less severe than even one clear offside goal so it will probably not stick around for as long.    Hold on, found a good example:   Outside of Dortmund fans, how many people do you hear bring up the Ribery incident in the CL final of 2013? I mean people forgot about your robbery against Malaga, so I think they will forget about the dismissal of a dangerous play Exactly. And everyone says that with VAR that game would have went differently. Turns out, it would have not... thank you. Ppl saying this will blow over when that RM-FCB tie is talked about to this very day still, and people still argue about whether or not one team cheated the other back then. No, they have no need to. The UEFA has to maximize gains. PSG vs RM maximizes everything. PSG couldn't be saved because they were extremely unlucky, so they couldn't let RM to chance after Joselu's wonderful goals. Agreed. Sometimes even 2 isn’t enough. No defender can contain Vini 1-1 throughout a whole match. It’s impossible. The cope hahahaha problem is Tuchel would rather die before starting Tel and Zaragozas corpse is probably somewhere in his office because he hasnt been seen since moving to Bayern so there simply is no one to play if Sane doesnt do it I'd argue Sané made an impact when scoring the equalizer in the first leg, though admittedly there wasn't much more than that from him.    There's no sitting it out though, he requires surgery and would be out for longer, but since Coman and Gnabry are/were out and Euros are around the corner, that wasn't an option. Which should be remembered whenever someone interprets his body language to argue that he has no motivation He made a huge difference the first left leg though, despite the pain. No chance you don't start him today.  Bit like Kahn in the world cup He got Karius'd/Donnarumma'd. Goalkeeper's curse. As a former goalie: it's a fucking mental nightmare of a position. Man looked absolutely broken in the post match Reminded me of Kahn's mistake against Ronaldo in 2002 I remember Rob Green against the US in 2010 World Cup. Made an all time mistake not handling Dempseys shot but went on to make a couple crucial saves to keep England leveled. No one remembers those though sadly And they are absolutely right Referees are a vital part of football. Seeing how much they get shit on, it makes me wonder who is actually going to step up to be a referee nowadays. I know I wouldnt want to Ahcyes where people agreed that you don't get in the way of the keeper? That was discussed because it was in favor of Madrid. When Madrid got shat on by the refs in La Liga everyone said ""well if you look at it closely the ref blew it 0.1 seconds before Carvajal hit the ball"" or ""well it was past the allocated extra time either way"" or there were some who even said ""well you deserved it for once"". Come on. What was wrong against Leipzig? Kane is the main one I am referencing. There was no reason for it (since he didn’t have a knock that I saw), and he gives us a lot outside of attacking with defending set pieces. Kane offers so much outside of just scoring, it's a really strange decision. to me it was the Kim sub on. I get he wanted to be more defensive on the right, but just bring Müller then. Kim being subbed on meant we had no effective means of going forward anymore because both wings were now dead weight and just waiting to defend. I get that Sane is injured. Dunno about Musiala. But Kane was fantastic and can wrestle Rüdiger and Nacho, hold the play up, play some lovely passes...   Why take him out lol... Game was over at 1-1. No way was Madrid not gonna score for another 30 mins and no way could Bayern keep up with literally all of their best offensive guys on the bench. Im guessing that while defending so deep they wanted someone with more pace up front to try and give them some reprieve when they clear the ball i kinda understand most of the subs for once. i usually hate defensive subs at the end of the game, but they barely had forward players to put on in those positions on the bench that wouldnt also be significant downgrades to the players on the pitch, and kane kinda looked very tired. And starting Sane while injured What if I recorded myself questioning it live in my living room? Source: Believe me, bro  I actually did say to my girlfriend that I thought it was weird to move to a back five and take Kane off in case of pens. Little did I know that pens were not needed. Well, I said it right as I saw it, I'm just typing what I said.  I've seen it a ton of times, It always happens. This was only a 1 - 0 lead, worst case scenario they score 1 and you still have gunpowder in your team. This way, they score 1 and you are fucked. They stopped playing because of the flag, not the whistle that was literally right when they stopped playing. I mean, I agree some are exaggerating, but that call was plainly wrong. Offside or not, let it play out, other times they let the play continue even on 3 meter offsides. Whatever the outcome would be, any fan would be right to be disappointed by such a decision. It's easy to say when you're never on the receiving end It's not crazy. Imagine a call like that in the last minutes happening to you. It's just a huge injustice and shouldn't happen. You don't know what could have happened if that decision had been made correctly. I saw an image showing that it wasn't but that's besides the point. Offside or not, let it play out. Other times they let the play continue on 3 meter offsides ffs So if a team actually scores their goals xG is deserved but when Real wins getting battered City didn’t deserve to win? So the first Bayern goal is non-existent to you? Madrid had the possession, dominance is another thing. They deserved to win, but only in the last 10 mins of a stalemate game. Kane twice, Kim header against the crossbar, Musialas shot. I am not denieying that Real was better, but it’s not like Bayern has zero chances in this game So Madrid didn deserve to go through those times in previous seasons when they were battered yet still went through? I can sky the ball over the goal a bunch too, doesnt mean i deserve a win. They know to let the play finish. Both plays were very different plays, in the second goal of real Madrid the possible offside happens in a pass to a player Who rapidly crossed to joselu, there was barely any time to whistle anything, in the Bayern play, the whistle was already blowed before the ball reached tye Bayern player, in fact the ball receiver (dont remember the players names sorry) was not even who assisted the goal, It was another Bayern player who catched the ball and assisted, not the same. You can't seriously compare the two. There is no way to even know if the referee would have called offside after the play was finished because the goal was scored less than half a second after the offside situation.  Look at the situations again, in the case of Joselus goal the linesman puts his flag up after Joselu touches the ball (by that time the ball had essentially crossed the line) and the referee blows for offside the next second. In the Bayern situation, the linesman puts his flag up right before Müller heads the ball, and the referee blows. Saying the referee let the play finish in the Joselu case is ridiculous. Different assistant ? One didn’t raise his flag early and one did I think that's on Bayern, the ref had to keep the game alive, it was already 90+13, any stop would've been final, he was moving the game very fast in the last minutes. Bayern wasted time before the 90 min any chance they got, they paid for that The thing is, there wasn't even time to react to call offside on Real's goal before it was scored. So you can't really compare the both situations. It’s that close therefore both the linesman and the ref fucked up by blowing the whistle and raising the flag respectively. Outcome might not have been the same but rules state Bayern should have been able to see the play out just like Real did. Because not letting an extremely close offside call play on *IS* ridiculous. Especially in a CL semi final.  The whole point is that Bayern could have absolutely scored on the opportunity and it might have been offside and we will never know because the officials fucked up a basic call. I am not calling it a robbery, as we have no idea if it would have been a goal had the whistle not been blown.  It does appear to be onside, although extremely close.  https://twitter.com/ArchivoVAR/status/1788323086216896948/photo/1 It's a terrible decision even if it was offside Sure, didn’t deny it. A lot of people here are arguing a goal was denied which is not the case here. We dont know which side Lunin would have taken a step.  Maybe to his right and save the shot, maybe not I doubt you had time to watch that 100x. The defenders stop marking and Lunin starts walking casually. You are just making shit up. Watch the 101st time where the defenders stop trying and Lunin makes no attempt at the ball because the whistle came before he even received the ball [deleted] Yes, defensively sound and play on the counter. It's surprising he's being so critical of Bayern If you win you're right if you lose you're wrong Yes it is but hypocrisy. Ancelotti didn’t take out our main attacking threat before the 90’ were over and Madrid plays better on the counter. Did Madrid take out our main attackers after Rodrygo scored in the first leg? What was Bayern game plan today? they are not as effective on the counter as Madrid. Madrid is happy to sit back and let the opposition have the ball like against Liverpool in the final, but that’s different than what Bayern did today. Besides, trying to have more possession than a Pep team is not smart Every side sits back against City every season  Only this year have they been more tactical defensively and they've probably haven't had less than 95%? games with more possession than the rival. That's Pep's signature, you know  I stand corrected, just checked it: they've had *NO* game this whole season with less possession. 100% dominance over the ball Yes, Madrid does play sitting back. I won’t criticize Atleti for defending and sitting back.   Bayern looked toothless all game and once they scored, Tuchel took off their main attacking threat. When did Madrid do this? Did you forget the absolute assblasting you guys got at Stamford Bridge or something? > disallowed goal off of a foul that had nothing to do with the play  Lol what? The player who scored the goal committed a blatant foul seconds before the ball went in  And Real had chances, yes, but so did you in the first leg and the players couldn't finish. You lost this tie because of the first leg being 2-2 when it shouldn't have been, and then losing the 2nd leg because of Neuer's mistake.  You played for the counter attack in Madrid and had the result in the bag until a howler from your keeper. Not sure why playing for counters is an issue when Madrid themselves have won several CLs playing like this. You wouldn't have been upset if you won like you should've It's honestly crazy seeing all these Bayern fans act like they had won the game except for that call. 2,9 Xg vs 0.3 xG for the stat merchants. It wouldn’t be a Real Madrid win without a remontada in the last minutes Bayern are much worse this year. They were never going to outplay Madrid in the Bernabeu. Their only chance was to score 1 goal and defend their lead until the end.  The better team doesn't always win like Man City who were eliminated by Real Madrid. ... and then you celebrated.  I just checked the vod kick off was at 93:30, I was off by 30 seconds. Time wasting adds more time. Plus it’s MINIMUM 9+ not maximum Yes because you kept being on the floor crying Absolutely. I also think that the ref was spot on to this point of the game. Completely ruined it. I didn’t say anything else? It was indeed an outrageous decision and shouldn’t have happened. Yeah that’s the point… it should not have been stopped… Real completely deserved to go through and would probably go through regardless of that shit call though I have seen Madrid waste to much time over the years on the floor as well… every team time wastes. Nothing would’ve happened without Neuers mistake lmao Nowhere near the ball when it’s headed So they've won the league every single year you've been a fan (apart from this year)? How loyal of you.  Plastic = choosing a club purely because they're successful when you have no other connection to them. Sorry but that is you! Fucking hell I actually lole’d Xavi ""Flavor Town"" Hernandez To appeal to redditors? Pretty sure he doesn't give a fk what other people think. And you shouldn't either. I have lots to live for.  But watching psg and city bomb out of the ucl sustains me.  It’s the nectar that brings sweetness in the evenings You’re right, let me not ruin his only fun time If you actually don’t just get into video games, anime or manga or books tbh How is that ironic? Go to his comments. You don’t even need to scroll to see multiple comments shitting on Xavi or Barcelona. Doesn’t take longer than 10 seconds Bald fraud spotted. If it's offside it's not wrongly called at all. Praxis/protocol do not determine good/bad calls, or at least flagrant errors. Only rightness.  There was not such possibility if it was never onside in first place, which It seemed to.  Don't make a mountain out of a molehill. No one is arguing it was a shit (very shit) call but bayern fans and even the players (see Muller's comments) make it seem like it was a clear dissallowed goal. [removed] As a real fan I don't like that the spotlight is on the referee. The side line ref should've let play go on and the main ref shouldn't have blew his whistle because once he did that I think the goalie stopped playing. You are correct - VAR cannot award the goal, but it can reverse a goal. And it this situation that is exactly what should happen: let them play, let them (possibly) score, settle on/offside with VAR and if it's off - goal is not given.   This is so fucking simple I cannot understand why ref would whistle. We have VAR and these rules with continuation of play for a reason. I think we had a similar case in the premier league around 2 years ago when Saka scored against man UTD and the ref finally went back to var and awarded a goal, but might confuse something. Referee always has the option to ignore the assistant and let the play finish. [An example when linesmen screws up and the referee plays on to let VAR intervene after.] (https://youtu.be/2PVm7jYAe8E?si=0za8e5c_rRhg2hlC&t=27)  The referee is as guilty as the linesmen for fucking up. That was my point, I made a typo haha. I meant it's on the ref for stopping the play and not letting VAR take a look, not the other way around I gotta get with the times man. I was just staring at the Spanish tweet trying to decode it with minimal Spanish lol ~~Yeah, small problem.~~  ~~The ChatGPT has drawn the line from the hand of Rudiger.~~  Yeah, small problem, I am an idiot... That yellow line is most likely the line between differently coloured patches of grass. People have analyzed it and the outcome was offside. The complaint by analysts was stopping play not the attack being onside. Show me Well Bayern caused a lot of the injury time. It’s worked exceptionally well 🤷🏼‍♂️ Everyone knows this. This doesn't need to be said It's possible that they would have scored but it wouldn't count anyways since it was an offside and VAR would have declined the goal. This is what I’m thinking as well. There was two huge mistakes that could’ve cause controversy to this game, and this one did. Completely unnecessary, I’m thinking it probably wouldn’t have been a goal as well. The other one was the two balls in play if Madrid would’ve scored there De Ligt interferes with the play from the offside position, it does not matter if he plays the ball or not, as soon as he makes a run for it he is ""active"" and he was offside at the time. I think it's a dumb rule but it is a RULE. >Can we please also talk about the fact    are you ok mate lol I'm pretty sure the flag was for Rudiger I think if you’re injured you come off for 1 min. Fake or not and that way it’s consistent. Just play net time. The ball goes out? Clock stops. Foul? Clock stops. And make each half like 30 mins or whatever the right number is to compensate. They don't. They're certainly better than years gone by but they toned it down because of the backlash. Start of the season you'd be seeing 5 or more mins added on in the first half and frequently 10 or more in the second. Now the first half especially is never more than 2 or 3 added, seemingly regardless of what happens.  You're the only guy on this site who's name I recognise cause you always have the worst takes imaginable. How's that a bad idea if less than 90 mins routinely gets played each game?  There are so many reasons and people just refuse to acknowledge that it would massively change the sport.  Game time would need to change, probably to 2x30m. It would completely change the flow of the game. It's now not a big deal to keep the game going, it can be paused at any point for any arbitrary amount of time.   This is IMO actually fine for youth and lower tiers... However, for top leagues this WILL result in multiple advertisement breaks being added.   Just look at hockey (NHL), a sport very similar to hockey in style. A game is supposed to be 3x20 minute periods with 15 min breaks between periods(2x15min), for a total of 60+30=90 min. But in practice they take around 150-170 minutes. There are ad breaks for basically every other stoppage in play. **60-80 minutes of unscheduled breaks** for a game that is supposed to take 90 minutes INCLUDING 2x15 min breaks in between periods. This is pathetic, and it will absolutely not make soccer more enjoyable to watch.  It's absolutely absurd to me that people will advocate such a change because their team didn't get 1 or 2 extra minutes of added time instead of having a more sane reaction like... maybe we should just more accurately count the time that is to be added??? not sure if you ever watched like 8th devision football, where there is only one ref who´s fitness is questionable at best. and he now is also supposed to keep time for every time the ball is not in active play? there is no way that works They suddenly stopped dropping after the 2nd goal, they started rushing, I think that's what contributed to ref error, he was rushing to put the ball back into play because once he stopped he had to end the game Who started dropping? It was just musiala who played with painkilllers and was subbed off after he dropped. And pavlovic who was forced to left the pitch to receive medical care, I don't think he intended to leave his team playing with 10 players. Have some shame I was also expecting.14+ minutes when monkeynicius started wasting time Well, if the game is heading to shootouts, you might want to make your last subs for it at last minute What the point in giving extra time then, if you just decide to have a little rest and it doesn’t get add on? Why are you being obtuse? Obviously when you foul you have to wait for the player to get the ball and kick it… in Madrid’s case they kept delaying the restart of the match. Modric lol If Tuchel started him over Kane Bayern would be heading to the final.  I have no doubt in my mind. I saw people saying that if Neuer wasn't on the pitch Bayern would have won. Mfer if Neuer wasn't making some absurd saves they'd have conceded like 3 times. Tbh Real were pushing for a goal really hard both before and after they conceded.  There are only 2 outcomes: - goalkeeper keeps them alive in legendary performance - GK or some defender eventually makes a mistake leading to a goal. Were they though? Real were by far the better side for the entire match and on the front foot. Bayern was hanging by a thread, scrambling around the last 30 min of the game. Where they? Bayern didn't look in control at any point of the match really, the goal probably would have come anyways Kane clearly wasnt exhausted. I don't think he was subbed off for exhaustion once during his Spurs career. He always finishes matches. Yes he was, he had lower back pain. How do you guys all write bullshit so confidently on social media I don’t get it. People forget because Bayern didn't win the tie, we did. If Bayern had won it would be the handful of bad decisions that went their way that get talked about from that tie In that case the history was written by the losers, after all these years they ignore everything that went against Madrid in that tie People seem to forget the vidal red card. The two offside goals. The handball in the box. Casemiro foul on Ribbery in the box. Casemiro not being sent off. Disgraceful Wasn't this the same tie that had Casemiro not being sent off early even though he should have been? that was a two way robbery though It will blow over, you're thinking in the context of Bayern fans who feel hard done by and RM fans who counter that point.    When it comes to the vast majority of football fans, who are neutrals to that tie, it did blow over and very few people talk about it anymore.   Helll, I haven't heard anyone talk about it in ages because I don't have many passionate bayern fan friends - most of the ones I'm friends with are pretty casual, and most of the more passionate football fans I'm friends with aren't Bayern or Real fans.    Unrelated: that is slightly weird, since I live in Bavaria. I KNOW a few passionate Bayern fans, but my friends all support ""weird"" clubs for our location like Köln, Hertha, Schalke, Pauli, Dortmund, Bremen, Arsenal, Huddersfield (yes, really), Napoli and West Ham - to name a bunch of my football group off the top of my head. as if the refs werent shit all tie long and didnt gift you guys atleast one pen too lmfao get over it Kyle Walker ? Reece James did just that ? Fair, in that case i'd shift musiala out wide, muller center Never once mentioned motivation This was a far easier save than Kahn's. I'm honestly baffled how it even happened. Never forget his broken finger Allison'd and Mendy'd It was Rivaldo's shot. Ronaldo scored after Kahn's mistake. Who is ""people"" here? Real Madrid fans? Nobody agreed on this Scratch that. Just saw Tuchel said Kane asked to come off due to a back issue. Yeah, It was his distribution that set up the goal. Subbing him with minutes to go and possible extra time and penalties is suspect. I think the funniest part was right after he got subbed Bayern had one of the best counter opportunities all game but completely fucked it and you know Kane in those positions would have feasted on it. Yea, completely agree. It was baffling. I mean just think in that one counter situation if it's Kane instead of uhh... I don't even remember. But we could have scored from that for sure.  I understand the other subs, I even think they were logical, but Kane? Not at all. He didn't look gassed either and what's more is his defensive workrate is at least as good as Choupo's anyway. He often clears corners against us. Is that Choupo Moting at his age? That's what I said to him lol. I said it live of course.   You don't fight a 1 - 0 lead against RM that way. They are too dangerous for that, it's too risky (they are going to score anyway because they don't need a good play to do it, just a flash of brilliance). Don't be wrong on purpose. Re-watch the whole play because it's clear that the whistle goes off before de ligt even touches the ball. It's easy to verify. Totally agree. Just saying that it wasn’t a guaranteed goal if it hadn’t been ruled offsides (probably wouldn’t have been if we’re being honest), and tons of fans are acting like it would have been.  It’s okay to be upset by it. I would be too. But it’s not okay to act like that was a guaranteed goal if that wasn’t called offsides.  It was offside though sounds like loads of people are just annoyed they bottled it and placing blame [deleted] Literally everyone said City dominated Madrid and Madrid have ""black magic"" or whatever lol, what are you talking about They were the better team but could not take their chances.  Madrid were the better team today and took their chances but the win is now questionable due to a stupid officiating error. madrid did score 2 valid goals Just xG does shit. You have score the goals as well. That is literally the goal of the game. The header against the crossbar was stopped for an offensive foul. You can't count that as a chance. Kim header was offside, and it was called offside. Umm, because Madrid also scored the goals beside being dominating?? I think that ""offside"" wasn't even on the pass to the player whose name I also don't recall right now, it was on the Joselu himself. So they was literally no time to whistle the play off because between the shot and the goal, there had to be time for a referee to react to reacting linesman. You can not flute despite a flag, play wouldn't be dead in that case. Goals have been given by VAR before exactly in this situation, linesman raises flag but referee whistles only after goal is scored Definitely agree the ref fucked up. I’m referring to the second part of the comment where the outcome might have been a goal. People on the post match thread were calling it a robbery because a goal was disallowed which it wasn’t It’s ridiculous, but not a robbery. There’s still a huge chances the situation would’ve played out 2-1 to Madrid if the ref had let the game play on Had they let it play out and Madrid defenders not turned off and there would be some run of play for 30 s AND then it would be decided as offside, there would have been more time lost for Bayern. Then you saw a different clip, because the one I saw had one whistle and that was not when Mazraoui headed the ball, which wasn't even headed by him but your player and went to Müller and not to De Ligt, he got the ball from Müller one pass later. Bayern wasn’t defensively sound. Rodrygo was off today but Vinicius was doing whatever he wanted against Kimmich on the left.   Bayern was also not countering anything. They were shockingly back on the counter. Madrid is much better on the counter. This, it's hilarious to read all the 20/20 hindsight analysis Don't disagree. Point being, disparaging bayern for playing defensive away from home against another big club is fucking stupid. What main attacking threat? He took off Kane at 85', not right after scoring. Sane was playing injured so he was taken off and Tuchel played for the 1-0 because he has no subs, everyone is injured. Gnabry injured during the game, Sane playing injured, and the only 'attacking' subs are Davies who was already on, Choupo, and Muller.  He brought on all those players, not sure what else people want from him lol Do you even remember that game? We had more than double your shots and were on the front foot for most of the game, you just had Benzema in the best season of his life and he scored a great hat trick.  Even with that, we were only 2 goals down lol I was criticising our play all match. Less so online but even then I made a few comments saying we looked horrible. To me, this is like spending 100 euros on a lottery ticket or betting your house on something very unlikely, and then pretending like it was a smart move when in fact the gods just graced you. I am also primarily talking about the tactics going into this match, not the entire tie. If we play like Madrid's derby rival we can expect to lose like them too.  It's really frustrating to hear valid criticism of players and Tuchel evaporate because of recency bias. Is Davies now suddenly good after looking subpar for most of the season? Does Neuer's mistake make him a fraud? Tuchel may have been good for Chelsea and Dortmund, but his cowardly tactics have no place here. We dominated them our midfield was running that game against theirs and their wingers kept whiffing all their counter attacking passes and Vini was roasting Kimmich at free will I need the field tilt before I can make an informed opinion Pfft amateurs  The better team doesn't always win, but the worse team should be able to criticize itself after a loss. I didnt hear a single Bayern player saying sorry for their performance.   Yes the decision is something you should complain about, but if you never mention the rest of the game then it's meaningless. Bayern team played bad, and the team should be held responsible for it after a loss. I don't know what VOD you checked because Bayern kicked it off at 92:48. And amazingly the referee gestured 2 more minutes just as the initial 9 ended. I guess 9+2 is 13. You talking about Bayern, these dudes started doing that and wasting time 75th minutes in. Yep and it was so easily avoidable too No, you are asking for VAR, but there was no goal for VAR to check. The linesman shouldn't have flagged it, but we will never know if Bayern would have scored or not without the whistle. Yea, but this is Champions League. we play to the last minute. Even if that goal would have counted, we still win... they had no offensive after the substitution. Holding Madrid for another 30 minutes would have been another Real Madrid vs Atletico final lol I fell in love with the club the season we lost the Champions League final in our own stadium…  Basically nobody in Sweden cheers for Bayern, and yet I’ve defended us through every defeat. I laughed at the original comment. I laughed even harder at your reply. Bloody hell I can appreciate hating of this magnitude F for when Xavi gets fired halfway through next season, there will never be another Xavi. Hopefully, he last all season. Damn, you went in, I don't remember the last time I made fun of Xavi. I wouldn't call myself a hater, I'm a Xavi admirer. He never fails to make me smile. idk bro, it was pretty glorious on the Bernabeu I can tell you that Correct, it was going to stand with the on-field decision because he blew his whistle, causing players to stop playing But can the main ref not blow the whistle once the line judge has raised the flag? Players can argue that they stopped playing once they see the offside flag raised up even if the main ref doesn’t blow the whistle Wrong. CR blows whistle too soon. Its a bad move from the CR Ehh still the players on the pitch can see the flag. It’s way too simple of an answer, linesman just need to hold the flag until the play is over. If you’re reffing at that level you just can’t get that wrong. Shakhtar vs Porto is the perfect example I agree the center ref could/should have waved off the offside, or at least not blown for it until the end.  My main question at the beginning on this thread it to see if we've even had real confirmation either way.  Which technically we can't since VAR didn't do their thing.  All of these freeze frames I saw weren't conclusive either way, so it's sad that VAR wasn't able to actually make the call.  All that said, I think that Madrid wins this in extra time.  Tuchel had already subbed of Kane thinking he won it, so not the best 11 on the pitch for Bayern. It was 50/50 in my mind for what you were getting at ;-P. Have an upvote (instead of no vote). I was just curious if gpt can analyse the image. Amazes me every time haha Mazraoui was onside. De Ligt was offside but wasn’t involved, so therefore it was onside.  But why even bother? You guys are through and if it was onside then it isn’t sure they would have scored and even if they did you guys would have killed it in the extra time. Bayern didn’t stand a chance. Absolutely. Never any controversy ever with VAR. 😂 Yeah but this narrative of Bayern being robbed of a sure goal is off. There’s no guarantee they score if the whistle doesn’t go and the defence doesn’t switch off. It was on. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] You know you are allowed to read past the comma, right? 1 minute is way to short, just make it 5 minutes. If you go down, and you need to be trateted by the physio's on the field you are out of the game for 5 minutes. Faking injury would never happen again. 5 minutes is rescinded if the player is subbed  Watching different games then Okay, I didn't really think about the ad breaks that would inevitably happen and I agree this would suck..   >It's absolutely absurd to me that people will advocate such a change because their team didn't get 1 or 2 extra minutes of added time  This is not why though. Making this change would mean there is zero incentive to roll around, fake injuries, or in general waste time since the clock is stopped anyway. This would imo be a great change for the sport. The fact that the ball is usually in play for just around an hour of the 90 (don't remember the exact number so don't quote me on this) anyway makes it seem so much more sensible to simply play 2x30, but stop the clock when play stops..  There is also the nightmare of not enough/too much extra time which would disappear completely. Sure, they can accurately add the time that is wasted, but players keep wasting time during the extra time too. There is also no way for the players on the field to know exactly how much time is left to play. Also, the ref can choose to let an attack finish or blow the whistle in a 1v1 situation, all up to the ref. This would not be an issue with a fixed time.  I agree that it would open up the possibility of ad breaks every time the play stops, but as I see it that is the singular downside.. It should somehow be possible to not let that happen (I would like to think). Like Real or any Spanish team never does that, imagine complaining when other teams do it as well. Did you not watching the game? You didn't see any time wasting? Wow! ""38 years young"" Modric LOL bro u think ECM can ping that ball for davies? TBF real would've won with bigger margins if it not because of Neuer. According to Tuchel he asked to be subbed of due to back problems He signaled to be subbed as his back muscles closed, which is an injury he's been nursing for a long time. Exactly, so the point is favouritism depending on the result. But the result should be secondary. A bad call is a bad call, end off. But for ""some"" reason, people seem to don't give a shit about this fact. Reminds me of the numerous horrendous calls against barca in the two legs against chelsea in 2009 that were completely forgotten because barca won and there were some horrendous calls against chelsea as well, primarily in the second leg. And I think you are wrong. Funny how that works. IMO he never should've been sent off, it was the hivemind of reddit throwing a fit. He was close to it, maybe - but nothing he ever did warranted a 2nd yellow. He walked a fine line, but stayed on the right side.  Who should've been sent off was Vidal - even before he was actually sent off.  Of course, reddit will have you believe Vidal's 2nd booking was wrong - even though it was painfully obvious that he hit Asensio first, then the ball.   Lack of retrospective from Bayern-supporters and/or Madrid haters always baffled me on that one... The goal Madrid scored in the extra time was offside, but up until then, Bayern only stayed in the tie cause of some critical ref errors going their way.   And Arturo Vidal did everything in his power to put Bayern in a position to lose. Missed a pen, was absolutely reckless with his tackless throughout the tie, eventually getting sent off. Very few people talk about him in that tie, but he was reason #1 Bayern went out. I think your reading comprehension is a bit off.  I'm on neither side of any debate. I'm simply saying that pretending people will forget the drama and only remember results is completely wrong when people clearly remember and are hung up about the drama surrounding a match from 7 years ago.  If anything, sounds like you need to get over something [deleted] > Kyle Walker ?  Doesnt have the speed disadvantage that Kimmich has which creates a whole different dynamic.  Kimmich knows he is at a disadvantage so he has to be perfect all the time otherwise he is fucked, which makes him a bit hesitant in some situations, Vini on the other hand knows he has the upper hand and can always go wide and use his speed if he gets doubled in the middle / kimmich shut him down there. Did he? I know he did a good job running him down in foot races but I don’t know how he fared in general. And I don’t remember him doing the whole job alone. Müller is Bayern's slightly more healthy equivalent to Dortmund's Reus: Fiercely dedicated, unquestionably skilled, deservedly respected and as experienced as it gets - but also no longer in his physical prime. There are reasons why both of them came on as impact subs in these semi-finals, and the harsh truth is that they don't have the legs for 90 minutes at this level (the absolute highest in club football) anymore. I didn't say you did. It was just a side note, people pointing fingers at Sané whenever Bayern isn't doing good and blaming him for having his shoulders hanging has been a thing since he's been there, yet he's playing despite the injury Gotta make a song out of that Thierry fucking Henry. Ok, that’s the only reasonable answer to sub him He’s still probably faster than Kane lol Tuchel says Kane was nursing an injury. Ok. I guess. I just don't understand moving to the back 5 I also agree it wouldn't have necessarily been a goal, however lots of fans are saying that it wouldn't have been a goal or that it was offside anyways, which is besides the point. A wrong call is a wrong call, no matter the outcome. I'm not using it as an excuse for the loss, however others also shouldn't excuse a wrong decision just because it possibly benefited them [Not sure if it was](https://x.com/beINSPORTS_EN/status/1788458339115909423), but like I said it's besides the point. Whatever the outcome, it was a wrong call, you should let the play continue and let it be decided afterwards. Other times they keep the play going even if the offside is obvious. Personally I'm not placing blame, it wasn't this decision that cost us the game, my point is that it was a stupid call which shouldn't happen at this level and you would have been frustrated as well if you had been on the receiving end [This](https://x.com/beINSPORTS_EN/status/1788458339115909423) doesn't really seem offside to me, and I can also say just as easily that you interpreted it the way you wanted to. But like I said, that's besides the point, offside or not, it was a wrong decision. I'm not excusing the loss, I'm mad about the poor decision, and let's not pretend you wouldn't have argued about the same decision if you were on the receiving end. Whatever the outcome, a wrong decision is a wrong decision There was also a shot by Dier during warmups that went into the goal before Madrid came on the pitch. Let’s count it all.   The only real chance was the Kane shot, besides Davies’ goal of course, Madrid completely dominated the game and would’ve won much easier if not for a Neuer masterclass. This is so pointless to argue with Real fans. > Bayern wasn’t defensively sound. Rodrygo was off today but Vinicius was doing whatever he wanted against Kimmich on the left.  I mean, they executed worse, but the basic idea was the same.  The biggest difference/issue here was, that Gnabry and Sane, who are both great weapons on the counter were playing injured, with Guerreiro and King already out. Bayern looked a lot less compact, then in the first leg and gave up several decent chances.  But its weird, to criticise the approach, when you deliberately did the same against another team, that was looking to co trol the game by dominating possession. > Bayern was also not countering anything. They were shockingly back on the counter. Madrid is much better on the counter.  You're right that Bayern wasn't defensively sound and Vinicius was able to do whatever he wanted on the wing, but Bayern was countering -- the problem was that they shot themselves in the foot on their opportunities as there were at least 3 chances that could've created a goal but they made a mistake in the buildup and on the worst blatant instance, didn't connect on the final pass that would've been a Kane tap in early on in the game. Rodrygo has been atrocious the last month. Yes, why was Kane taken off? Sane I do understand. Thinking you got the game in the bag against Madrid out of all teams who is known for coming back late in the game is silly. Madrid kept offensive players on the pitch to play on the counter. How was that comparable. Ance also started planning for the penalties while Tuchel bet the entire house on the 1-0. IIRC it was about 80% in Real's favor Please no dark magic in the final. I think its pretty normal reaction to be angry at the referee right after the match because they feel they had chance to come back and win. I'm pretty sure they'll be more angry with themselves for allowing 2 goals than with the referee. Well, if you knew, that the game was kicked off at 92:48, why did you chose to point out, that VAR gave the goal at 91:21, when the match didn't continue till 92:48? 100% of the time wasting was by bayren. Karma I think even Tuchel was down for a minute or two in this game. Lol totally, as a neutral I’m kinda glad it got thrown back in their face. I am asking for var lmao, there was a goal within 5 seconds of the whistle… Maybe, but nothing is a guarantee. That’s why they play the games… if I could predict every outcome I would be rich and never lose a bet lol Good for you, but still plastic. The main ref blew the whistle, so a couple of players stopped playing. Fucking Cristiano Ronaldo still helping madrid win the champions league. Truly the goat. Wrong. The linesman also raised his flag too early. It was a mistake by both of them. You play to the whistle not the flag. Countless examples of refs ignoring linesman pre var Linesman needed to hold the flag but at the same time you play until you hear the whistle. That was the quickest flag/whistle for an offside/goal that I’ve seen in a long time. Every other situation they wait until play has stopped to raise for offside I appreciate it lol It’s corrected thousands of tight offside decisions. The controversy is from fans crying about the correct decisions most of the time. 99 percent chance that it doesn't become a goal. Agreed. Also, a 99.9 percent chance Neuer doesn't spill the ball like he's learned from Karius his whole life. But he did, and it's important to let it play on. Which sucks.  Congrats on the win. I'm in awe of your club Maybe we see it differently but for my eyes it looks like an offside. De Ligt also interfered with play from a very very clear offside position which would rule out any possible goal so at the end of the day the end result was correct. What video? Every video/picture looks offside to my eyes but we might see it differently. But whatever even if it somehow was onside, De Ligt interfered with play from an offside position which means no goal. They did what they were supposed to on the Madrid goal, and the ref didn't even raise the flag until after the goal. Don't be a dunce.   The Bayern one, the AR wrongly raised his flag immediately instead of delaying it. The ref trusted his linesman was flagging for an obvious offside (as instructed) and blew the whistle. The controversy is that the AR made an idiotic decision. Militao likely would have blocked the shot had the whistle not gone, but we'll never know because the AR fucked up.  I hate Madrid (Barca fan), but those two aren't even comparable. Madrid even had a goal (rightly) chalked off. If there was some kind of conspiracy here, they probably would have let that stand. That was their only real chance to influence the game. To be fair that’s a different linesman and a lot more of a bang bang play As soon as he starts running towards action he is interfering according to the rules... and as the bloke above said, the latter part of your comment is not a fact That'll just lead to players playing through pain in fear of being forced off for 5 minutes. It would be a nightmare for player welfare. I didnt say they dont do it. I said that they did it yesterday, literally everyfucking minute. And after they got outscored they started rushing, demanding minutes. That rush contributed to ref error, he gave no pauses during the final minutes. He shouldve stopped the game 4 minutes before this incident I think I proved to you I did watch the game. Enlighten me, who wasted time from bayern? Yeah go rewatch the Kimmich vs Vinicius thown in situation. No I don’t but ECM would be putting in goals him self. Did u watch the Tuchel interview. Guy was just spitting out shit lol. ""This is a good situation for us"", after completely fucking up the lead. Twice. In both legs. Also people love outrage about this more than what's factual. It's no secret why clickbaits and such are a thing. I'm not wrong at all, the reality is Madrid had more decisions in their favour. I think Vidal walked a fine line, but stayed on the right side. Who should've been sent off was Casemiro. Like multiple times. How does that sound? And 100% of your takes are shit buddy enjoy being made of jealousy He did better than anyone on Bayern ever could, that’s for sure ;) Same reason kroos and modric share minutes constantly Yes, I lost it when he came off but it makes sense now. I should’ve known better since Kane has very rarely not gone a full 90 for us. [deleted] How so? What am I saying that’s wrong? Again, Madrid does this often and it works well against teams like City. If Gnabry and Sane are the weapons on the counter and are injured, perhaps it is on the manager to make a better game plan?  Madrid performs well without the ball and executes well on the counter. That’s why they eliminated such a dominant City twice in the last 3 years Gnabry, injured. Sane, injured. Kane as I've now learned was having back issues and was subbed off. He could say the same for us too That is not how it works?! The linesman fucked up, but there was nothing for VAR to check.. VAR even corrected an offside decision in *this* game.  Joselu's second was initially ruled offside. You can solve offside decisions without VAR, you just need a calibrated offside line. I was a big supporter of VAR, but how could anyone argue that there haven't been multiple decisions by VAR that nobody ever understands? In Germany alone they are discussing VAR like every weekend because of horrendous decisions. Oh I agree 100% the ref blew it (pun intended.)   Thanks for the compliment, on to the final! It's not seeing it differently. It was broken down on CBS. He was on The De Ligt interference? That's a different subject, and I'd have to review that part. Either way, the chances it ends up a goal are still very slim. Just piss poor from the linesman Which I never said it was. That's what ""probably"" stands for.  This is exhausting. No, because you can leave the field of play for treatment without the 5 minute penalty. The 5 min penalty only occurs if you refuse to leave the field of play thus wasting time Hahaha w average performance by gnabry sane musiala who would assist him? ECM will play if bayern got most of the ball, Rightly so Tuchel opted for counter attack and let madrid w the possession, but his creative talent let him down big time. I mean less than .5 xg 😬😳 Yeah you are.The reality is people are cherrypicking BS calls and only taking in to consideration the calls that benefitted one team, for the simple reason the other team was so God fucking awful they couldn't even take advantage of absolutely BS-decisions that went their way. At the same time somehow taking a moral high ground. Which is fucking hilarious.  If you can't understand this you are not only wrong, but dumb as well. Cool. Except it isn’t exactly factual, is it. Vidal got righty sent off. [deleted] Just watched this compilation: https://youtu.be/-daPJEMZiHE?si=NNj4Zi9eqMhi0XmX  Walker is a good matchup against Vini. He beats him on top speed and on physicality. Vini is just a bit quicker in small spaces. Plus he has gotten excellent at passing over the last few years. Even when you take away his ability to dribble into the box he still creates attacking options for his teammates.   Underrated is his work rate. He might fail v Walker 4 out of 5 times but he doesn’t stop and barely slows down all game. Must be exhausting to defend against. > He did better than anyone on Bayern ever could  Dumbest shit I have read today. I never said it's the reason we are out but you're too dense apparently You didn't answer their comment at all. > If Gnabry and Sane are the weapons on the counter and are injured, perhaps it is on the manager to make a better game plan?  Sure, wich kind of gameplan do you advise then, when both your wingers are not at 100% and Musiala just returned from injury before the first leg?  You want them to press high and try to dominate the space?  Again, the difference was the execution, not the general idea, you can't say, that RM had a viable gameplan and then criticise the same gameplan for another team, especially since Bayern looked solid defensively sitting back against Arsenal in the second leg, just like Real did against City. And it would have shown the truth, be it offside or not. The lines man didn’t fuck up, the bald bitch with the whistle fucked up. If he hadn’t blown, we would have gotten a VAR. U have no clue, have you? How are you discussing var when it was not even in play here?   It is the linesmen and the ref that bottled it and you are arguing about var being controversial 😂 Linesman is just doing his job and he has the best possible angle of seeing wether it is or isn't an offside. I doubt any linesman would raise the flag in 90+9+5th minute if he was unsure. But yeah VAR check probably should still have been done. then which fact are you referring to when you say “can we talk about the fact”? lol ""But what if the player is in too much pain to move off the field?""  This is just an absurdity. 8 times out of 10 the 'injury' is fake to try and influence the officials' calling or to waste time. If you can't physically get off the field, we will stretcher you off and you are subbed out. If it's *really* that bad, you clearly can't play elite soccer, so what's the issue?  The real problem is the rolling clock. I'm not saying get rid of it. I'm just saying it's the source of the problem. If the official could pause the clock just during injuries, we'd have much less of a problem. It's just so frustrating that the end of every single competitive match plays out the same way with one team wasting as much time as possible. And then, like yesterday, the script flips *as soon as RM goes up*. It's just stupid. You are very generous. The only avarage performance was Musiala. Sane was awfull and Gnabry was off after 30min. Davies scored, but he didn't do much else then that. Complete graveyard shift for Kane.  Scapegoating Kane is really poor taste. Neuer was winning it and Neuer lost it at the end. It is what it is. Mate, we just counted the decisions, Real Madrid had more decisions in their favour, stop yapping. Same thing happened in 2018. It's very factual if I say so. If you can draw the line in Casemiro's case I can also do that. Hilarious, vardrid and their double standards ...you're implying that the ref who disallowed one of their goals and didn't blow the whistle after 9 minutes of extra time was paid off?   I don't even like Madrid, but you conspiracy melts are so hilariously off your rockers. If that guy was paid off, Madrid should ask for their money back. Hell, did they also pay off Tuchel and force him to make those terrible subs? What do you mean? They didn’t ask any questions? I just voiced my opinion The difference to me is that Madrid has the tools to execute such gameplan which Bayern does not. I would not criticize Atleti for playing defensive. I would criticize them if they attempted to play tiki taka and they were failing miserably since they do not have the type of players for that.    Why is the choice just press high and dominate the space or sit back and pray to God Madrid doesn’t score? [deleted] I have not started the discussion about VAR, what the hell are you on about? You people seriously need to start to understand what the hell you're reading. No. He's not doing his job. His job is to let the play go on and raise it after the attack. He did the opposite of his job. See, that's why everyone is mad. Are you fucking unable to read or understand anything? Read the thread again if you are that dense. Jesus Christ.. Bayern har 1 BS penalty in the first leg  Vidal should have been sent of in the second game already before he was wrongly sentaf, after the tackle on Casemiro.  Bayern had an offside goal  Boateng's tackle on Casemiro could easilly have been a pen.   Then:  Real 2 offside goals  Case should have been sent off.   So sit down and shut up. Both teams were fucked by the refs. One fanbase admits it, one has their heads so far up their asses they don't knows night from day. And then to top it all off, they act superior. Whatever makes you happy, man. You can also explain to me how Carvajal handled the ball with his chest (penalty in the first leg), or how Lewa wasn’t offside (he was) for the Bayern second goal in Madrid to even get to extra time.  But sure, whatever makes you happy, genuinely. Farewell, stranger on the internet. [deleted] The point you make is totally meaningless. Yes ,maybe Bayern doesn't score, or yes, maybe it was offside. But what we complain about is, that they just got denied the chance, to see what will happen just by the refs call. I mean they have var for exactly this reason.  It was an awful mistake that shouldn't have happened. It feels basically like a scam. What you wrote doesn't fit under the comment you answered too. That's why the other person complained > The difference to me is that Madrid has the tools to execute such gameplan which Bayern does not.  Well, as I just pointed out, they did this against Arsenal and it worked  well, so they definitely have the tools to execute such gameplan.  > Why is the choice just press high and dominate the space or sit back and pray to God Madrid doesn’t score?  It was a rhetoric question, cuz they were criticised for playing defensively, while it is quite appereant, that this was a choice made because if injury issues.  You are obviously free to tell me, what kind of gameplan you think would have been appropriate. Lmao Shut up you are continuously arguing about var here, you talked about a ""probably right "" decision... Listen to yourself and please have some reflection of how dumb this statement is. Alright well whatever it's not a goal and that's all that matters. Now I'll head to sleep no energy to fight on reddit anymore. Have a great day/night. just trying to see how long will you double down on being an idiot lol Calm down and watch https://youtube.com/shorts/RT0ffEuVxRQ?si=axNQRbS7zfatTkMG https://youtube.com/shorts/YZrD3S31IVk?si=DOSRXD4dWxYJZIF3 Also the lewandowski 1vs 1 against gk situation which was wrongfully called offside Just accept that uefa and the referees did all they could to  make Madrid win and stop yapping Ok, 2 wrong decisions againt madrid vs 5 wrong decisions against bayern https://youtu.be/c3fJ4aZ495A?si=Xp69ntJi-q9EOdmX You're fucking delusional mate.   It was a single refereeing mistake. That's all there was in this match, and you claim he was paid? Why'd he not just give the disallowed goal or blow the whistle at 9 mins, wouldn't that be LESS obvious than making that mistake?   Also don't act like added time is this consistent always the same thing. The prem has a lot, the CL often doesn't. The first leg had 3 minutes, when there were 2 pens and a regular goal, which alone took more time.   They obviously weren't paid by Madrid and you've got no proof whatsoever, just spouting BS and making big conspiracy theorists. Get your tinfoil hat off, accept that people make mistakes and that this one might not even make a difference - we still don't know if it was offside and if it would've been a goal. And even then, how likely is it Bayern win from thereon out? But you’re missing my point lol, I said it was a ridiculous mistake. BUT not a robbery, cause it wasn’t a fair goal situation that they turned over, the goal situation ended up cause of the whistle. The players stopped playing cause of the whistle which is how the goal scoring opportunity came >Well, as I just pointed out, they did this against Arsenal and it worked well, so they definitely have the tools to execute such gameplan.    Did it? they struggled with Arsenal and comparing Madrid to Arsenal is idiotic. But thankfully to us, we are now heading to the final thanks to Tuchel. Forever grateful! Take some of your own pills my friend. You are so fucking deluded your parents have to be siblings. Both teams got fucked. One team used it better than the other. You can try to do all kinds of mental gymnastics in order to justify losing, but the fact will aleays remain that you hade the exact same chances, but just fucked it up. Taking accountability has been a tough part for germans (and german lovers) historically, and great to see the customs are live and well. What 5, do tell? What am i looking at? Whoever made the video labeled every clear Bayern offside decision a mistake for some reason lol And that's why they complained. Have a nice day They were in control the entirety of the second leg against Arsenal, where did you see them struggle? You were the one who claimed that Bayern ahs not the tools to execute this kind of game plan, while they certainly were able to pull it off against an oponent thats currently 1pt ahead of the team you did this against.   I was also under the impression, that we are discussing a statement that you made regarding the gameplan and then you avoid answering  what kind of gameplan you think would have been better, just to switch to a passiv agressive ""lol we won"".  Well, you obviously won, I never denied that. Wow nice comeback, plenty of arguments and self reflection, respect. Are you mentally challenged and can't count? They didn't have the exact same chances. Madrid had waaay more favourable decisions. What mistake was in bayern favour in 2018? You think there is no corruption in football or what? 😂 Be honest with yourself and stop being a prick, it's not like someone from real madrid cares about you buddy, stop defending them like they are your family or smth And you too! Fuck me the internet is so unbelievably toxic. Way more? Two offside goals and Case not being sent off, compared to the list of Bayern? Mate, you ain't bright, so take it easy with asking if I can count.   Who is talking about 2018? You apparently. Again, cherrypicking then the point you arw trying to get across is complete BS.   And I'm the prick? I have no problem admitting the team I follow get favourable refereeing decisions. You seem to have huge problems with it. Why?   >it's not like someone from real madrid cares about you buddy, stop defending them like they are your family or smth  I know you are pretty dense, but even you have to understand the irony in that, right? I mean, use those three braincells and reeeeeeally try your best here. I aggree You are the toxic one in this thread lol https://youtu.be/c3fJ4aZ495A?si=Xp69ntJi-q9EOdmX 🤫 theft. Why shouldn't I talk about 2018 if it was a robbery too. That just proves that there was an agenda, not just some ""innocent mistakes on both parts"" as you are trying to imply Yeah, then why are you part of it? Of course I am. Have you read all the stuff people threw at me here? lol.. For some reason Reddit has just decided that I'm the villain, but I was never the first to attack people if you read closely. You are so fucking sad. Yeah, take some random youtuber that pulls shit out their asses. Muller is offside. So is Lewa. Neither picture shows the right viewing angle. The same effect could be seen during the world cup with the ""Japan""-incident. Vidal should have been sent off wayyyy earlier than he was. And again, Bayern got to extra time with an offside goal.   And Sure, fine. If you tuck your tail between your legs and have to change years in order to continue your narrative then so be it, we can also talk 2018. It's both fucking hilarious and sad, but so are you.  So what do you want to bitch about now? Why are you? Show the right angle then 😂 QED. You are saying the call is wrong. You have the burden of proof. Anyone who has seen more than 10 games understand that the camera angle is misleading for offside.   Or, you know. You could just admit the fact that Bayern had all the possibilities in the world and just couldn't take them. Like the big boy you try to be. Oh so you don't have any proof, then stick your angle up your ass. Both onside. In Lewandeski's case you can just look at the grass line. Clear onside. Funny how the referee could call that offside , but couldn't call the 1 meter offside on Ronaldo 😂DISGRACE I don't need any proof? You are the one bitchig about unfair treatment here and UEFA being against you. At the moment, the only difference between you and a cranky 3yo is that no-one expects more from the 3yo. If you can't offer any proof that the calls were wrong, you are just a huge crybaby. Both are offside. Clear as day. No amount of you crying will change that, and you know it.   Yeah, Ronaldo was offside for the two goals. Again, I have no problem admitting it. The ref made mistakes. The same way they made mistakes with the penalty, the tying goal, Vidal not being sent off earlier etc etc. You are the one having problems here, not me. I just gave you the proof, you refuse to accept it. At least Vidal was sent off, Casemiro wasn't. You didn't give shit. You gave a selective fan made video that showed the wrong angle. I can also look up ""Madridistachannel_1902"" or something similar with one sided BS videos and call them ""proof"". I don't tho, because I'm not a moron.   Again, I already said Case should have been sent off. You see, I once again have no problem admitting the wrong calls. You are the one in denial and acting like a spoiled child."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Offside by a centimeter or not, definitely impossible to call right away... It’s just such an insane blunder.   No one can say for certainty if Bayern would have scored but to be robbed of a clear goal scoring opportunity at the death of the game is appalling. Well, that makes that blunder by the refereeing team so much worse.  It wasn't a guaranteed goal, but it was a very big chance. Denying to play it out for a potentially tying goal was a massive error. Bayern clearly didnt say anulo mufa enough times before facing real's black magic I'm not saying he's either on or off but that's definitely not the correct line. Both Mazraouis' knee and Rüdiger's heel are beyond the line lol. I think I can see Mazraoui's knee if that counts as breaking the plane - but also Rudiger's foot appears to be behind the line anyway? Issue is with these mistakes, they never get recalled so it just gets forgotten when the final rolls around. So they train the refs and emphasize they should let play continue, but nothing changes for Bayern or for the dozens of other teams that get impacted by bad calls.     There is no solution by the way. You can't replay for obvious reasons, the only solution is referees are consistent and follow the rules everybody knows and follows. Also claiming Bayern didn't deserve the win doesn't excuse the mistake. Can't hear Richard Keys voice without hearing ""did you smash it?"" And ""Redknap hanging out the back of it"" even when they are talking about offsides he sounds like a creep. Not a fan of either side, but the point of debate should ONLY be centered around when the offsides was called. The ref blew the whistle a good few seconds before De Ligt is able to adjust his body, that's when the defenders stop trying to contest the ball, and then De Ligt makes contact that leads to the goal. Under regular circumstances we don't know if he is able to get that clean strike while under pressure from Real's defense. The narrative should stop being ""Bayern denied a goal."" They were denied a goal scoring opportunity. The call was made too early, that's 100% true but you cannot say for certainty a goal would have been scored if the ref did not blow the whistle. It's not whether there was offside or not that matters. Why do any networks or publications focus on that? Something about forest and trees and missing shit. The problem was flagging the play too quickly with the subsequent whistle. Nothing else. Once that happened, we'll never know if anything important would have happened.  I get people wanting to do post-facto analysis on the video, but if you're doing it, maybe make sure your offsides line is somewhat horizontal?  Or at least close enough that it's not obviously crooked?  https://ibb.co/vvy6YZD  The point remains that this should have been reviewed, but showing he was 1cm offsides rather than 1cm onsides would probably have garnered fewer clicks. That was my impression too. De Ligt might be off (but clearly passive) and Mazraoui is onside. Disgraceful from linesman and ref. Play on and wait for VAR. How can you raise your flag in a situation like  this (CL Semi-final, last minute) unless you are clear it is 5m offside? How can anyone say De Ligt is passive here? He actively makes a run for a pass, while being offside. Plus, later, he is in the defender's path towards that other Bayern player.  Would it be an offside if someone passes a ball to a guy 5 metres in an offside position, he makes a run for it, and the goalkeeper runs towards the ball to prevent him from getting there, and lets say he hits that player in a challenge inside the box. Would that be a penalty? This is why you let the play finish like in the prem, even though fans hate the delay this is the right way to do it It was much closer than all of us expect.  Stopping the play was fkn dumb. It distracted our players from defending, destroyed the mood of the game, prevented a possible comeback from Bayern.  Not only this, but the game should've ended much sooner, fkn 15 minutes of stoppage time? I've seen teams stall the game for much longer and have like 6\~7 minutes of stoppage. In that image (the original without the beIN graphics) you cant see Rudiger's foot. They are just gambling assuming where it is.  Without the VAR technology for semiautomatic offsides you cant tell, unless using that image. Let's not forget that bein is just making a novelty presentation. It's just their opinion that it's onside because they don't have access to the offside cameras. While they are making it look like VAR they can't actually check it with just the broadcast footage which they are doing in the video. Mistake for sure, but I don't understand what the big deal is. He blew the whistle before Muller even headed the ball to De Ligt. All of Madrid players stopped. Lunin just stood there. There was no goal. It's just another bad offsides call, not a disallowed goal. There are still lots of bad offsides calls in every game. You only review them if there's a goal. End of story. I would be more worried as to why the referee didn't end the game at minute +9 or even +11 after he announced two more minutes. If he really wanted to help Madrid he would've just blown the whistle. Much easier than supposedly disallowing a legitimate goal for Bayern. Would De Ligt not be also on a positional offside as he makes the run for the cross?  Ref should have left the play continue though. Is it just me or is the very front of his knee poking through the line? Right next to De Light's foot. Lunin didnt even try to get the ball cause the play was over. Tough luck. You dont know if it wouldve gone in if Madrids players literally hadn’t stopped moving. Cry a fucking river. The better team won yesterday. Tbh, why isn't this system fully automated. AI is getting stronger and object identification can probably be used to automate this proces. Why not get rid of the lineman for offside at all to avoid such issues? Btw this is the ref that absolutely fucked the toon against PSG with his diabolical handball call - terrible terrible referee Beinsports tech is not gonna be reliable, its basically the best guess of a bunch of amateurs. The real question is if Lunin would have saved it The linesman and ref made a mistake, but the whilst e affected the play. We can't pretend it would have lead up to a goal normally.  Still terrible call. People here debating about de ligt should be considered offside or not here tells me that, even if the ref hadn't whistled this would still have been a controversial decision for VAR to be given too.  And I mean this is completely ignoring the fact the goal mostly would not have went in at all if madrid defence and gk didn't switch off after the whistle. Beinsports always does this. They draw fake lines and claim something happened. Should have whistled the game over at 90' + 11' like he said he would and this is not an issue. The linesman saved Bayern from the humiliation that was coming in the extra time. Bayern can only blame themselves. The game shouldn't even be that long. The ref gave them more time than neccessary to draw. They were just a level below Real yesterday. It was never onside because the ref called for the game to stop before the shot, imaging allowing a goal when you make the other team stop playing. The craziest part is that there's a good argument going into this match that this is the best referee crew in the world you could have picked.  Huge brain fart from the AR, and moderate brain fart from the referee not to use comms to say, ""Let this play finish first,"" but at that level they all trust each other to be world class, so I can't totally blame the referee for trusting his AR saw what he signaled he saw. FFS, I'm a huge Bayern fan, but the 'offside' has ZERO bearing on this case.  The ref blew his whistle BEFORE the shot, so the play is dead then.  Period. This is so utterly pointless -- the defenders switched off as soon as the whistle blew, Rudiger pulled back, Militao made a half-hearted attempt at a block, and Lunin didn't even dive. Linesman should have waited, but he didn’t and the ref blew the whistle, Real’s players all stopped playing and then the ball was put in the net. De Ligt probably doesn’t even get a shot away let alone scoring if they keep playing.   Seems like a non issue to me. they didnt even line up *this* one right, they have the line from rudigers sleeve instead of his heel The only thing that is in any way comforting is that maybe keeper would’ve saved the shot if the whistle wasn’t blown. It hurts much more because he actually scored so we are all left with a big “what if” It is a blunder. That's it. Neuer made a blunder and so did the referee. It will probably costs him in Final spot or future competition.  It is a disaster but idk what else can be done, lol. Why do everyone seems to think the ball would still go in if the ref didnt blow the whistle? The goalie stop play and didnt dive because he heard the whistle. De Ligt is offside Yeah but the Nacho goal, or something - 🤨, probably stopping the play was indeed a bad call, should have let the attack finish and then raise the flag DE ligt is off and are you gonna say that he was not part of the play? Misleading title. It wasn't a goal because the game was already stopped (Real Madrid players doesn't even try to defend after hearing the whistle). I’m so confused. He’s literally offside in this clip.  Edit: Stop upvoting me, I’m wrong. You’re looking at the wrong guy. Some of us who never liked Marciniak (he had given all the contested decisions against us in an EL R16 match against Wolves) are gleefully grinning that his ""top referee"" myth finally crashed and burned. Ref blew it, that is all If only we had VAR de ligt is offside, and he does interfere with play Bayern got the short end of the stick here. Oh well….we could have gotten a penalty too in 1/4 finals. It’s all good.  Bayern deserved to go through 1/4, Madrid deserved to go through to finals. De Ligt great finish is what it’s really flaming this topic.  If Bayern also stopped playing after whistle it would be just a “oh bad, call, whatever”.  Newcastle penalty vs PSG was much worse. If true so sad for Bayern, another ref howler It really doesn't matter, the ref had already blown the whistle stopping the play. They would not have scored if Real players had not stopped because of the whistle. De Ligt is offside and he isn't passive. It's an offside. Yes, the refs fucked up, but don't act like this was ONSIDE. It wasn't. The real controversy here is De light is clearly in an offside position. He didn't get the ball, but he sure is a part of the offensive play. If this is allowed, there would be no offside anymore. seeing the discussion here about de ligt’s role…i’m trying to imagine the linesman pov and wonder if 1. He confused de light’s movement as being the “offside player” to interfere and/or 2. Considered Mendy’s involvement as an immediate change of possesion and thus the attack being over  obv the flag should have waited and so should the whistle either way I'm tired of arguments whether the fucking knee was offside or not. And even though the ref mistake of not letting the play continue is something we should demand from refs, it's also annoying.    Time to change the offside rule to something that computers can return automatic answer about and remove the human element completely. Players are too fast,  the game is too fast paced for human refs. Something like the entire player should be ahead of the defender should be possible to be determined by computer vision.  In the world cup, that was offside. Hala madrid. Bayern tried shithousing and wasting time the second after davies scored yet they benefited from the time they Lost and shithoused, this action took place way out of time, offside or not, the Game should have ended earlier. Period. Also blame tuchel for the Moronic substitutions. Wonder if we’re going to hear lots of complaining about the officials from the same pundits and commentators who act like the linesman has pissed all over a terminally ill child every time they take 5 seconds to raise their flag. Hehe Lunin even not making an attempt led to the alleged goal so it wasn’t even a goal to begin with Drogba said it best. “It’s a fxkng disgrace” 😂 Lol!!!!!!! Mazraoui didn’t even touch the ball This hurt, but in the end it's not what lost us the match. The subs and the Neuer mistake cost the match. If Bayern had scored here, it would have given hope, but I think they were so gassed they wouldn't have been able to survive another 30 minutes. It's still baffling that this happened though, in such a crucial match. I just know that they would not have blown the whistle if the roles were reversed, that's the most frustrating aspect. In the UCL, more often than not, it's Real that gets such calls. It would be different if it were one offs, but they could build a resume on blown calls in Real's favor in just the past decade. hala Madrid And there you have it... Total sidenote on this whole mess, but that was some dog shit punditry. Time to get rid of V.A.R I still can't get why Bayern players didn't stop the game when that offside was called. Then they could have asked for the VAR to check. I said this yesterday, that if it wasn’t the foot it would’ve been the shoulder that put him onside. Paralax effect ? Sport networks are creating their own VAR images? We know, we know Such an awful application, or misapplication, of the law. I do think the Real players stopped, but we will never know if De Ligt would have scored or not. The very thing the system was supposed to improve, and they absolutely fucked it. so does the lineman get fined/fired? Surely this is not what the offside rule was intended to prevent? There has to be a better way than projecting a line across a single zoomed in camera angle and seeing if a players toe is giving them am advantage. Honestly, you could probably do away with offsides and the game wouldn't be much worse off for it. We having fucking VAR now. Use it. always in favour of real madrid. ft has gone crazy with so many bif accounts bringing up videos of how real madrid always gets away after cheating and/or referee's error. The rule needs changing. If it's too close to call, tie goes to Offensive Player. Scoring should ALWAYS have the top priority. Honestly gonna avoid watching the final and will catch Europa final instead. This some bs why the referee didn t whistled after 9 minutes or let s say 9+2 if he wanted real madrid to win ?  use logic   they made a huge mistake, yes but not because they wanted to favour RM .  Maybe it was offside maybe not but it was NOT a goal .   RM players stopped after whistle .   Let s admitt that Tuchel and Neur took RM to the final not the referee . He onside because he is behind his teammate but even if he wasn't he is still behind rudigers hand How its this not a clear offside? the arm/hand doesnt count in offsides. What are the rules, exactly? Because that plane is using the shoulder of the attacker, but the outstretched arm of the defender. Important to not that this isn’t the official VAR offside line drawn from compositing multiple on-field cameras.  This is recreated by BEIN studio using the bad camera angle on the replay.  As such you can see that the line isn’t drawn correctly. Rudiger is clearly much behind the line and this extension is what makes it look like Mazraoui is onside. [deleted] This has to go to VAR LMAO Line starting on Rudiger's arm, LMAO It looked onside in real time as well, not letting VAR make the call was criminal. Love the silence cause they knew they fucked up. [deleted] Same referee that robbed Newcastle against PSG I wonder if people realize that all these “controversies” are manufactured. Even one of the best goalkeeper is not safe from real madrid black magic voodoo what makes you think a referee has a chance against that shit Polish revenge Real Madrid players literally stopped after the whistle...if the whistle was not blown it would not have been a goal They both made a play on the ball though, so offside it is Are we gonna pretend this is official? Because if so, his knee is poking through… The correct title should be ""de ligt is OFFSIDE"". It is a correct OFFSIDE call, although the lineman should've waited for VAR. There was no goal either way. First of all, we don’t know for sure since none of us have access to the offside cameras being used, that has a higher amount of frames per second.  It’s all irrelevant though, because of the protocol error by the AR1.   He should never have raised his flag, because it forces Marciniak to blow his whistle based on AR1’s decision. Sorry for my ignorance, but why does it matter if ANY of them was offside? After all it was Mendy who headed the ball and created a new situation. No? no play lead to a ball being put in the back of the net, play was stopped and De Ligt decided to keep playing, adding fuel to the fire of what was yes a stupid call. Blaming and tarnishing Madrid for this mistake is embarrassingly cringe though ​ ""Con VAR o sin VAR, el Real Madrid te va robar"" The arguments that ""real was the better team anyway"" and ""tuchel's subs lost them the game not the ref"" are just unreasonable. Just because you are the worse team doesnt mean you dont deserve fair refereeing or that the better team should be made the winner by any means necessary. If that was the case real wouldnt even be in the semis On with the two guys is offside the ball clearly is going to one of them! So if the lines man sees at least one of them he’s going to raise up he’s flag! What happened to let play continue until the attack id over? Guess it didn't apply yesterday VARdrid however u look at it, that early call was super super susipicious. What a disgrace. Anyhow - this will be forgotton in time and real will once again have a ""clean"" title regardless of desicion making. Pretty brutal night for the refs. He also called Joselu's 2nd goal as offside before being overturned by VAR. lol     btw, i wouldn't even blame the main ref for this one. If the linesman puts his flag up that early, the ref probably thought it's a clear offside. I mean, why are the linesmen even for if the main ref isn't supposed to trust their verdict too, considering the linesman had a far better viewing angle of the situation than the main ref did. What i'm saying is - the linesman screwed up. No one is able to definitively say for sure if De Ligt and Mazraoui are offside or not, even with VAR and the lines drawn by TV productions.  Even if the referee lets the play go on, the linesman has his offside flag up after the goal, VAR would review and determine there's nothing conclusive enough to overturn the decision of the linesman, goal would still not stand. What a joke. Terrible refereeing If you look at the replay again you can see that Mendy headed the ball, not DeLigt I'm sorry but if the discusson takes THIS long it should just be a goal. If you're not sure without drawing lines it's a joke to even attempt to overturn anything. You'll hear that Tuchel failed at Bayern by not winning any trophies, but when that's brought up you won't hear about the linesman that didn't let the play finish and incorrectly called this offside which would have extended the game.  That's the worst part. Legacies are affected by these shit calls. It won’t change shit though. u/savevideo Doesn't matter guys. Bayern didn't deserve to be here in the first place. Arsenal got robbed in that game, Bayern got robbed here. karma and all that stuff. Why didn't var overrule the decision? Mods, what the fuck is that flair? oh no, anyway Klopp screaming for a replay From this shot its literally offside, Maz shoulder and Rüdiger leg, would need physical var footage to judge it correctly, still players played to the whistle, hence De Ligt could even shot, i hate that its being called ""goal"". It is simply not a goal but a chance, which pretty much could be offside anyways (again need footage from var to judge it correctly hence its probably to the centimeters). If it was offside there shouldnt even be a topic about it anyways. De Light is off, and he plays a big role in the défense, so to be fair referees would have called offside. It was out of time in first place so it should have never happened They are both offside... This angle is bad. There is somewhere on twitter better angle with explenation that referes were right to call offside. Tale as old as time. There's a reason they can have an extra calm during nerve wracking matches. They know, ultimately, there's an invisible hand at play when needed. It's been more than obvious, specially in the domestic competitions, but also happens in Europe, with the eyes of the world watching, and half of them not batting an eye because of the allure of the whole galactico philosophy... I was really mad when i saw bayern fans sucking up with madridistas and chanting puta barca. It kinda makes me happy they lost in this manner. Its similar to how we all feel when psg loses. I didn't watch any match coverage for this match.  Recognized Wenger's voice immediately So if it's Mendy that headed the ball, isn't it who is offside when the ball was last played by a Bayern player, which is de ligt? Or is it that Mendy played the ball intentionally so there is no offside consideration at all? [deleted] Am I tripping? Mendy headed the ball why is no one mentioning that… only “if off by a millimeter it should still be allowed to play on” I mean ... on one hand, better team won anyway, so theres little satysfaction there i guess?   BUUUUUUT, better team doesnt always win ... football is stupid / amazing that way.    now we have only ""IFs"" ... Madrid fans after La Liga Valencia game - La Liga is corrupt! The refs are always against us, this is an outrage. This injustice in unacceptable. We deserved to win. More proof Barca pays refs...  Madrid fan after UCL semi finals against Bayern - let's not forget Tuchel's substitutions thats the reason Bayern lost, it's a shame that our win is now tainted because of an honest mistake from the linesman, everyone just hates us because we're so good  The amount of cope and mental gymnastics is amazing. Very similar situations in those games but polar opposite reactions from the fans Wanted to see a German Classico at Wembley. But as always, Madristas spoil the party. 😑😑😑 Can’t wait till the truth comes out of Madrid paying out referees Honestly fuck VAR. this adds to such a comedically long list of wrongdoings it’s caused. Go back to how it was pre BAR for the sake of all of us Totally a coincidence guys, ref gifting them yet another cl, honest mistake! Ref be like: EVERYBODY DOWN THIS IS A ROBBERY! [deleted] So Barca had refs on the payroll and Madrid still has them in the payroll wasn't it obvious? Special people in the comments yesterday: Clearly offside.  rofl There is simply more money in a Real - BVB Cup Final than BVB vs Bayren. Referees try not to be corrupt in a match with a laliga team (impossible) I know its not the case now but its fair and just that when the referee error causes a result to change, then the game should be repeated..... Why is this tagged as misleading title, lmao are the mods Real Madrid fans Hahahaha wtf. cringe embarrasing What a surprise, the most important and impossibly tight decision benefitted Real when the match was played in Madrid. Who would've thought?! have people forgotten all the other robberies of real madrid? for example in the last clasico where the  ball was clearly inside and it didnt count. This is a regular day in LaLiga. Barça only win if they are completely dominating there should be clause to replay matches Yeah no shit you corrupt bastards. The saddest part is you know Tuchel was right when he said if it was on the opposite end of the pitch, play would not have stopped. Rightfully so with the Rudiger chance we have a clear example of it as well. Incoming lawsuit. Exactly, an eagle would wait to look at it From this perspective, it looks like the linesman can't see Rudiger, he might have looked clearly offside. What's strange to me is that ref blows the whistle before the linesman raises his flag (something no one is talking about or even noticed, it seems), which makes me really curious as to what was communicated between them in that moment.  Maybe the linesman told the ref he thinks it's off, but was going to let the play continue, and the ref just blows it for some reason.  Or maybe the linesman was going to raise the flag regardless, and the ref was just faster to the whistle.  In any case, the ref did not stop the play due to seeing the flag go up. He did it based on what he heard in his ear. Then why DID they call it right away? Home cooking? Agree Then the whistle shouldn't have been blown and VAR should have been left to sort it out. It is possible if it puts Real Madrid in the final. The only person robbed was Joselu from scoring a Semifinal hatrick De Ligt is half a body ahead and active in the play. The linesman should have waited, I agree, but the offiside call isn't wrong, and it's very possible for a human eye to make. It's time to move past the complaints. Also, since the call was accurate, making it early actually benefits Bayern as they were the team behind. With the tech they have too. I think Christina said there were three different levels of tech and they didn’t use a single one. She was so defeated when she said goodbye I was broken for her. Wait, so the ref denied a clear goal scoring opportunity? Red card, every time, straight to jail. I’ve seen worse calls. Like RVP getting sent off. At least this is a mistake, not an ego trip. come on, you can't call that a clear goal scoring opportunity. If no whistle is blown there they'd be lucky to get a shot off at all, let alone on target or a clear goal scoring opportunity. Good thing: it was just Bayern and they deserve shit with their moronic management. Sorry for Kane, but fuck the rest. But this doesn’t change anything, because the right was to SEE whether it was on or not. But looking at it yesterday it seemed quite on. His knee was in line with Rudigers back foot. It’s just such comedic incompetence It was not a big chance, every defender and the goalkeeper stopped moving after the whistle, I'd be surprised if he even got the shot off with defenders not stationery. Watch it again, they all just shut down, the defender is just flinching, not trying to block the shot from the goal, Lunin doesn't even move Imagine responding “Ok then we complain about kimmich dive” to this. lol absolutely fuck that anci clown Extra time was excessive, whistle should've blown minutes before this anyways. Anyways, this discussion is so boring, linesman have discretion to blow when they see fit, and if he was confident in his call the moment he blew there's nothing we can do It would not have been a big chance since Nacho was going for the ball but stopped after the whistle It’s crazy how the linesman messed up! There is no denying that it's a huge reffing blunder, and at this stage it's certainly unacceptable. But like you say, it wasn't a guaranteed goal. Nacho or Rudiger would have intervened with De Ligt and more importantly Lunin would have probably saved it. Concluding that Bayern were robbed of a goal is just anti-Madrid sentiment. People are are just frustrated that Real Madrid are serial winners and are jumping on any bandwagon to try an discredit their amazingly impressive success. It’s not a very big chance at all if the whistle also didn’t lead to Madrid players to stop playing. I mean. There were 3 touches after the whistle blew.   Who knows what would've happened. We will never know.  But, whistle did blow early and most of the players kinda stopped.   Everyone else keeps saying , with absolute certainty , the goal should've stood. Which is totally untrue Anulo mufa. Just in case for later today. Bein loves doing these post fact ""definitive"" lines and they are always anything but I think you are mistaking De Ligt's left hand as being Rudiger's right heal. If it was his heal then his right leg would be shorter than his left.  EDIT: Also, that's De Ligt's right foot, not Mazraoui's knee. In this case the line is drawn from Mazraoui not the last point of the defender. I don't know why they've done it here, potentially to show maz was still onside but it should be drawn from the last point of the defender in all instances to provide a clear image of what's onside and what's not. It's also at an angle to make Mazraoui look further onside. wouldn't it be offside since de ligt is actively participating in the play? > Both Mazraouis' knee  That's De Ligt's knee.  Can someone explain why this is downvoted when it is in fact De Ligt's knee? lol If Rüdiger feet is behind the line then the line is wrong  yeah, Rüdigers heel plays them on It's rudigers arm/shoulder that's relevant, I think, not his foot.   I'm not sure about Mazraoui's knee. I can see Kane's but I just might be missing it You mistook it here.  De Ligt was offside (that is his knee you saw there). He didn't go for the ball though.  Mazraoui however was completely onside. He was the one who went for the ball The linesman literally apologized and admitted his mistake. Sure it still sucks but what else is there to be done? Are they to replay the whole second leg? If Bayern take away from this that they lost because of a bad call and not that they fucked up a 3 on 1 break while leading 1-0 by playing two of those most inept passes of the entire game ...I don't know man, that doesn't strike me as the attitude required here I am similarly wondering if the announcers ever get recalled or impacted in other ways when making boneheaded statements like the one about ""Sauerkraut parties"" last night.  I mean, we all know those Germans are such sauer Krauts ...   🍺🍺 What's the solution here? 2017 & 2018 were not forgotten and those were the matches that created VAR  I think that it is absolutely stupid that the refs can't check var whenever they want. and for some reason when it really matters it is usually against Madrid.  Referees change their decision making game by game, moment by moment. They are human, and make human error, and have human biases, and they are told they should not have those and so they pretend they don't. If they recognized it, addressed it, and tried to fix it there could be progress. But the referees take turns between putting their head in the sand, or so far up their own asses they have difficulty swallowing their lies. I do not dislike referees, I dislike any system that lacks transparency, accountability, and refuses to acknowledge the problems which are obvious to a rational and objective observer. It has gotten so bad that I do call for a complete overhaul of the top echelon of refereeing administration. You don't have to get rid of the referees, but absolutely eliminate the heads of the associations. All refereeing associations should be monitored extremely closely for corruption. The public seems to think corruption is impossible despite it existing in every other aspect of government, corporate, and societal interactions. You wonder how he still has a job after the things he said about Sian Massey  >During Liverpool's 3-0 Premier League victory against Wolves, when Massey made a tight offside decision that was found to be completely correct upon video replay, Keys said, thinking their microphones had been switched off: “Somebody better get down there and explain offside to her Massey.”  >“Yeah, I know. Can you believe that? Female linesman. Forget what I said - they probably don’t know the offside rule,"" Gray added.  >""Course they don't,"" said Keys.  >Gray replied: “Why is there a female linesman? Somebody’s f*cked up big.”  >Keys was also found to have made a comment about West Ham United vice-chair Karren Brady's newspaper column, saying: ""The game's gone mad. See charming Karren Brady this morning complaining about sexism? Yeah. Do me a favour, love.""  >Another tape was revealed consisting of Gray crudely discussing Massey's physical appearance with a different colleague - Andy Burton. exactly, no ""goal"" was scored. This behavior is not helping anyone and only tarnishing what was a great game. Sad The whistle blew even before the headed pass that led to the shot. With all this discussion going on, there is one thing for certain. The linesman fucked up. He made a mistake by flagging way too early.  All the rest that happened after that is speculation sadly. What would've or should've happened after the whistle is not the point. The linesman fucked up and he should face consequences. The blunder is denying a clear chance. We don't know what would've happened because they massively fucked up. VAR supporters always tell me that getting the call right is what matters.  Now we're complaining about the protocol not being followed on something that appears to have been the correct call in the end. >Once that happened, we'll never know if anything important would have happened.   Well we know nothing important would have happened since De Ligt was offside. But of course the problem was as you describe it.   It's only relevant to look at the offside lines now to counter all the silly comments about Bayern being robbed. [deleted] Saying that De Ligt is passive in this play is absurd he's not passive, he's being covered by rudiger how the fuck is de light passive. hes literally running for the ball [deleted] Shouldn't we be looking at Muller if he's off or not? He's the one who received the long ball right. De Light definitely looks off but Muller is harder to call He’s not passive. Don’t show your blatant bias If you say De Ligt is off, then it doesn't matter if Mazraoui is on because De Ligt is obviously interfering with play. Mendy has to track both the runners in front of him, making De Ligt ""active"" even if he doesn't head the first ball What a shame honestly, the game would have had a different outcome if it wasn't for the refs mistake >	How can anyone say De Ligt is passive here? He actively makes a run for a pass, while being offside.   >	It is not an offence to be in an offside position  >	A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched* by a team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by:  >	interfering with play by playing or touching a ball passed or touched by a team-mate or interfering with an opponent by:  -	preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision  (De Ligt didn’t do this) -	challenging an opponent for the ball (De Ligt didn’t “challenge” anyone for the ball as per IFAB definition of the word)  -	clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent (De Ligt didn’t clearly attempt to play the ball)  -	making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball (no obvious action by De Ligt made that impacted the ability of an opponent to play the ball, running towards the ball is completely legal in almost any scenario.)     https://i.imgur.com/0c2YuKQ.png  Only when Rudiger either gets clearly blocked by De Ligt from reaching the ball or gets pressured by an offside De Ligt to clear the ball the moment he receives it is when De Ligt is considered offside in that situation. Similar to Joselu not being ruled offside when the ball got played to Rudiger in the same match, even though Joselu was drawing defenders to him.   >	Would it be an offside if someone passes a ball to a guy 5 metres in an offside position, he makes a run for it, and the goalkeeper runs towards the ball to prevent him from getting there, and lets say he hits that player in a challenge inside the box. Would that be a penalty?  >	an offence is committed against a player in an offside position who is already playing or attempting to play the ball, or challenging an opponent for the ball, the offside offence is penalised as it has occurred before the foul challenge >  later, he is in the defender's path towards that other Bayern player.  And this alone would result in goal being ruled out by VAR, as the rules are clear about this:  *In situations where:*  *a player moving from, or standing in, an offside position is in the way of an opponent and interferes with the movement of the opponent towards the ball, this is an offside offence if it impacts on the ability of the opponent to play or challenge for the ball; if the player moves into the way of an opponent and impedes the opponent’s progress (e.g. blocks the opponent), the offence should be penalised under Law 12* They’re supposed to let play finish everywhere. It’s just an error by the refereeing team. Unfortunate, but it’s unavoidable.   You’re not going to completely eliminate errors from refereeing, it’s human nature. Also he gave 9 minutes, played like 10:30, then added 2 more and played 4 😂 it was a mess half of the stoppage time was from time wasting too which isn't supposed to be counted, like in thus past world cup. BeInShit is not a reliable source for anything. Let’s not forgot that you are just making a novelty presentation. It’s just your opinion that they’re wrong because you want them to be wrong. I think you shouldn't be making this comment with this flair. It's not a good look on you. It's not relevant that this isn't 100% accurate, the referee made a massive mistake not letting the play develop. Whether it's just offside or just onside, the ref should never ever blow that whistle. > You only review them if there's a goal.  But that's the point here: It was blown off prematurely, when referees are specifically instructed to let situations like these play out, then use the technology available to arrive at the correct decision - regardless of whether it results in a goal or not.   >  I would be more worried as to why the referee didn't end the game at minute +9 or even +11 after he announced two more minutes.  Because it's *minimum* added time, and the referee accounted for a lenghty VAR check, two lenghty bookings, and a substitution during added time. De Ligt stopped and ultimately didn't go for the ball.  In my view, it doesn't tick any of the boxes for an offside accordings to the rules and guidelines. I mean Real players stop when they see the line and hear the whistle, like Lunin doesn't even make an effort to try and catch the ball,  It's play pretend to believe that  it would have gone in. Although I agree they fucked by not letting the play on. Looks like it is, yeah - and you can quite clearly see the sole of Rüdiger's shoe, too. It's just inaccurately drawn. And if it does bayern still needs to play 30 minutes with none of their good attackers having been the worse team for basically the whole game Because offsides are often subjective Yeah but I’m pretty sure this ref team did the World Cup final so they’re trusted I guess, if the literally “best” refs in the world can make mistakes that are this silly at such a crucial time in such a crucial game I’m not sure there will ever be a solution If Marciniak is a terrible referee then there are no good refs out there. And the one who didnt give Thuram a red for sqeezing some balls against Atletico He was rotten as hell in the Atletico v. Liverpool first leg in the 2020 Champions League Round of 16. Fell for Atletico's nonsense hook, line and sinker.   I was frankly surprised when I saw him getting higher profile matches since then and was even more surprised he was perfectly fine in a lot of them. Maybe it's more amplified since he's improved since 2020, but when Marciniak has a howler, he absolutely has one. He also cancelled Alonso’s goal for Chelsea against Real two years ago > The game shouldn't even be that long. The ref gave them more time than neccessary to draw.  It's a *minimum*, as in the minimum added time was nine minutes last night - more than two of those were spent on a VAR check, and were followed by two lenghtier stoppages for bookings on Tuchel and Camavinga. I don't think it's an outrageous decision to play as long as they did, really. So because Real was better Bayern doesnt deserve fair refereeing gottcha wild take He wouldnt even had a chance to shoot if the ref hadnt blown the whistle. How do you figure? Is this even his fault? If the linesman raises the flag the play is over VAR can't do anything in this situation. De Ligt is in offside position, but doesnt commit offside offence (doesnt attempt to play tha ball). He doesn't. You don't understand the rules correctly if you think De Ligt interfered with the play. He doesn’t interfere with play The linesman and ref have both admitted that they were at fault. why the referee didn t whistled after 9 minutes or let s say 9+2 if he wanted real madrid to win ?  use logic   they made a huge mistake, yes but not because they wanted to favour RM .  Maybe it was offside maybe not but it was NOT a goal .   RM players stopped after whistle .   Let s admitt that Tuchel and Neur took RM to the final not the referee . The referee blew the whistle before the goal was scored. That's why VAR can't get involved. That's what makes it criminal what the assistant referee did. He gets a fat bonus from papi perez  Whistle was blown, play was dead. VAR cant rule on a dead play. Thats the current rule  actually  That isn’t how offside works This but unironically. I wonder if they realise that the football isn’t round. That's de ligt's knee Rudigers heel pokes even more through. He was onside. Howler from the ref Look at Rüdigers right leg It does not force him to blow the whistle. It absolutely does not force him to blow the whistle, there's calls like this every week where the linesman puts the flag up and the ref still waits until play is concluded Bros commented on every r/soccer post defending madrid It is unreasonable just like it’s unreasonable to think that if they would’ve let the play go on they would’ve scored. bro its kinda sad tbh... like why is real every time favored? against leipzig was the same, and its the same every year, not only in ucl btw, what is the explanation for this > He also called Joselu's 2nd goal as offside before being overturned by VAR  So the process worked, and VAR served its purpose - bit weird to slag the referees off for that, really.  > If the linesman puts his flag up that early, the ref probably thought it's a clear offside  Linesman lifting his flag doesn't stop play, only the referee blowing his whistle does. They're both specifically instructed to let scenes like this develop to allow VAR to check them, just like they did with the Joselu goal earlier. They've both made massive errors here. >He also called Joselu's 2nd goal as offside before being overturned by VAR  At least he didn't blow the whistle early on that one... Wtf are you talking about? ""No one is able to say"" based on what? This game has semi-automated offside. If it did go to VAR, they would've absolutely been able to make the right call. I don't know man... dudes happy every time Bayern loses. How based on this angle can you say its ""literally offside""? based on the angle Rudi's foot is equal to Mazraouis shoulder? Ofcourse this should be discussed because it shows a clear movement away from precedence set throughout the campaign in delaying raising the offside flag to let play develop, randomly fucking up at one of the most important games in the tournament deserves being discussed and being criticised I don't agree.    DeLigt doesn't go for that ball, he stops e takes 2 steps back way before the balls gets near the place where Mendy heads it.    And Mendy goes for the ball because of Mazraoui, Mazraoui is the one who interfears in this part of the play and Mendy's decision taking, but Mazraoui (apparently) is not offside.   Terrible, terrible mistake. Someone on Twitter isn’t going to have a better angle than the bein team with all their technology. Let’s be serious here. De Ligt didn't interfere with Mendy playing the ball. Marzaoui did (as he was close to him and challenging for the ball).  Since Mendy plays the ball intentionally, it is a new situation. You don't carry your offside position status ad infinitum Didn't we have more than that when Bellingham goal was disallowed in Just a league game in la liga? This is champions league semi final.... People are talking about referee's mistake of blowing the whistle ... What's the problem with that? > But real was the better team without any doubt.  If we go by that alone, Real shouldn't even be in the semi-finals. And Bayern should have had a bigger lead from the first leg where they were clearly the better team as well. Who cares about your opinion here? Wrong thread. If we are talking about what is deserved, Real would half half the CL trophies and Liverpool had 2 more...Spanish teams invented time wasting and diving btw You're delusional Man City were definitively better than Real over two legs but went out? The main gripe is that we’ll never know, not that it was a guarantee, but Bayern did get denied even the opportunity to do something on that play because of an incorrect decision. If Madrid got the Joselu goal that the flag got raised on whistled by the ref before he scores, there would have been outrage also, because it would have been wrong. I don’t think people are implying that Bayern were so much better and deserved to win, but they deserved the correct and fair opportunities to tie it/win, no? The 9 minutes of stoppage was decided before Real Madrid scored their second goal.  You have to add additional stoppage time to account for the delay between Real Madrid's goal and restart, and any other delays that occurred after regular time.  I do think play went a bit too long, but your notion that the whistle should have been blown around +10ish is nonsense.  The opportunity in question here likely should've been the end of play. We still defended pretty well and we don’t know what would have happened if we went into overtime. The Bayern players looked hungry for that goal in the end and the two madrid goals were a situation like this one and an unlucky mistake from Neuer. So you can’t know what would have happened if the ref played the situation out. No it shouldn't. Circumstances need to be far more extreme than an offside decision for a game to be replayed. Eagles on VAR would be an improvement tbf  What about a sparrow Doesn't matter, closing minutes of a Champions League semi-final, vision blocked by a player, nobody would give a fuck if he didn't catch the offside. Keep the flag down and let the people who can see everything decide. Linesmen communicate with the ref via mics, the ref isn't looking out for the flag going up since years ago, the flag is there for the linesman to tell the rest of the stadium & to indicate where it happened. The linesman has more way to signalize the main referee. I have heard that there is a button on the flag that can send signal to, I think, referee's watch. So in the act of raising the flag he can use it to inform the ref about his decision even faster.   Alternatively, the ref might have wanted to end the match in the moment (because I think it was already past the time) when Real player headed the ball away, bit didn't expect the Bayern player to take control over it, but I feel like in that case he would own it as 100% his mistake and the linesman wouldn't feel the need to apologize himself. Agree, the problem is all of the Real Madrid players stopped before he scored. “Don’t let them score” It’s Madrid. Madrid means best ratings. Uefa gets what they want. They’re taking notes from nba lmao ya an all polish crew are secretly RM fans.  the conspiracy theories on this sub sometimes... who cares if de ligt is offside here or not, hes not active You don't understand the current offside rule. De Ligt is not classed as 'actively involved' according to the rule at that moment. It doesn't matter that he becomes involved soon after, because he isn't offside when the ball is headed to him. I've seen so many people say this. It surprises me how confidently wrong they are of how the offside rule works That’s because the whistle was already blown. They can’t use tech to give the goal since there was no goal since the play was already stopped when it went it. The real and inexplicable fuck up is that the refs didn’t let the play finish I was trying to think what the 3 layers of technology would be.  I could only think of 2: Comms and VAR. Fr they should give red cards to refs. Are there rules for ref fuck ups? I think a fair thing would be to give Bayern a free kick from the spot Mendy heads it. RM would still be the ones to get fucked by the ref at that point but without the refs mistake the ball would've been there anyway Or blowing the whistle in the middle of a cross into the box that would had lead to a goal. We’ll never know because they didn’t allow play to continue as they should have done per their own rules. Every linesman knows to let it play out, especially with so much experience at that level. I tend to believe it was intentional people getting incompetent when certain teams play. It's why i stopped watching football many years ago. Shit won't change anytime soon either. Stop saying incompetence, they have been doing this for years and even decades in Uefa competitions in favour of Real madrid. Especially against Bayern it seems. Third time they've gotten massively robbed against madrid in the last 7 years. Exactly.   This is tiring. I'm a Barca fan. I hate Madrid, but there is no conspiracy here. It's a simple mistake at an unfortunate time. The refs had plenty of chances to influence the game if there was any intent for Madrid to win. They chalked off a goal and let the game run an extra 5 minutes beyond the 9 minutes of allotted extra time. This is just a moment of poor refereeing. It happens all the time, and the chances that Bayern would have scored from it are low. Not to mention the chances of Bayern winning in extra time.  I get the complaints from Bayern and fans, but the only complaint is that they were denied an opportunity. Not a certain goal, and certainly not the game. Exactly.  A chance no question.  But I think it's being overblown how ""big"" of a chance it actually was.  People seem to be equating this to a 1v1 with the keeper or something. Nah I’m fine with Ancelotti saying that.  Who cares that it’s not true?  He’s Madrid’s manager.  Of course he’s supposed to say something to keep his squads confidence up and make them feel they deserve to go through.  He wants them to go into the final feeling like they can definitely win if they play their game. There was a 3 minute pause for VAR on the Real goal in stoppage time. Adding 3 mins on for a 3 minute stoppage is not excessive. Claiming linesmen 'blow' for anything is so funny, and no, they don't have 'discretion' to flag when they see fit. They're not supposed to put the flag up in situations like this, they can't just raise their flags whenever they like. the big problem is that we will never know, as this huge blunder caused the Real players to stop. if that hadnt happened, maybe they would have stopped a goal, but maybe not - thats the big fucking issue here. > Nacho or Rudiger would have intervened with De Ligt and more importantly Lunin would have probably saved it. Concluding that Bayern were robbed of a goal is just anti-Madrid sentiment.  Assuming that De Ligt would't have made the goal is the same as other people saying it would have been a goal. >Nacho or Rudiger ~~would~~ **could maybe** have intervened with De Ligt and more importantly Lunin ~~would~~ **could** ~~probably~~ have saved it.  They were deprived of something that could have been a goal. and we will never know I don't think it's fair to say people are frustrated that Madrid are just serial winners. Whether it was Madrid or any other team in their situation, they were getting the benefit of so many calls. Probably should have seen 4 yellow cards in the first half alone and got 0. The point in the first half where there were 2 balls on the pitch and play continued and real almost scored. And then calling offside here without letting the play continue. It would obviously be dumb to say the refs were ""on their side"" or something, but nearly every call that went their way did go their way with the exception of the foul on kimmich. The officiating as a whole was aweful. And it's frustrating because it seems like people dismiss these genuine complaints as ""sore loser mentality"" but when Liverpool beat us, when villa real beat us, when city beat us, that wasn't on the ref, the other teams outplayed us and that was that. But this game was very close and Bayern fans have a lot of legitimate complaints about how aweful the officiating in this game was. Well that worked out well didn’t it? I’m gonna start using it too, lol. Like you guys fucking need it lol  Your black magic is just as strong KIRICOCHO Well done 👍 The line they drew for Tot-Liv would beg to differ bru. I think people are talking about [this](https://i.imgur.com/WzJS5r5.png) being his knee, which it is. De Ligt's right foot is above hat. FYI, it's spelled ""heel"". I believe the line is being drawn from the end of Rudigers shoulder. What seems to be his right foot is actually De Ligts arm. > Can someone explain why this is downvoted when it is in fact De Ligt's knee? lol  Because they're not talking about De Ligt's knee, but the other one that's *also* beyond the line. It's a little harder to spot, but it's there. I'm confused with the rule.  Does Rudi's heel have to be on the ground to count as the final line, or just any part of his heel?  I know the arm doesn't matter.  What about other body parts? No, if Rudiger's foot/heel is closer to the goal line, that's where the line should be placed. Do arms count for the defending side? De Ligt didn’t go for the ball but both him and Mazraoi raised there hands calling for the ball and were basically shoulder to shoulder running so it’s obvious why the referee viewed him as being involved in the play and thus calling it offsides.  Even though he 100% should have waited until play was over. The recommended solutions for a lot of people are:   1- replay the march    2- kill the ref every time he makes a mistake and replace him with a new one    3- both 1 and 2 Do you know if he said why he felt the need to raise it this time? I assume he would have hundreds of hours of experience Id like them to improve. >Are they to replay the whole second leg?  Unironically that's what people in the barca sub were calling for. A replay of the entire game over 1 bad ref call that didn't even definitively cause us to win. It’s what Klopp would demand This ist one of the best examples for challenge-flags in football.  If referees won't use the technology they have available on their own, there should be a way to make them use it by the teams themselves. But this is Football. You don't win football by playing well. You don't win football because you deserve to/earned a win. You win football by scoring goals. A goal scoring opportunity being taken away by a ref's mistake is as significant as your team blundering its lead And that still doesn't change the fact, that this might have been determinal to the result. Football has allways been a game with rather high variance.  In fact, pretty much all of the players voiced their frustrations after the game, but also admitted a lackluster performance of their squad, Müller and MdL also complimented RM players for their performance. Bayern will know they messed up a 3 on 1 counter up 1-0.  Bayern will know they made a mistake by subbing off Kane and Musiala, their biggest attacking threats too early and gambling on holding on.  Bayern will know that Madrid were the better side and deserved to win on the balance of play. And if not for Neuer's performance before the error, Madrid would be ot of sight.  But ultimately football isn't decided on xG, and despite the mistakes above, they had one clear chance to get back into the game and take it to extra time, which they were robbed of by an officiating error. And they've every right to be mad about that. It’s wild to me to see how everyone is making this the point of the match where Bayern would’ve equalized and won and they got robbed. Sure, bad call, it is what it is. But all night Bayern has misplaced passes, been in defensive mode, can’t put a ball in the back of the net being a 2-v-1, shit substitutions, time wasting when they’re up but getting pissed at Madrids time wasting when down. They’re just using the bad call as an overshadowing of them not being able to make it. The bad call was unfortunate, but if you’re not clinical with your chances, Madrid will come knocking and that’s what happens. You had 90+ minutes to win and didn’t. You *might’ve* equalized, and won the game, or not. Football isn’t about « might’ve » and « if’s » Sorry. I mean, they earned the 1:0 they fucked up to make it 1:1, fucked up again to make it 1-2, and then earned this very good shot at making it 2:2, which was taken from them. It's not that this call cost them the entire game, it's that it cost them the chance to take it to extra time. I too believe they would have lost after 120 minutes regardless, but they should have at least gotten the possibility to get there, and having that taken from you by the ref at this level will always get the most attention, in my book rightly so. 1. Give refs more training   2. Make them use VAR more often   3. Mic up the refs   4. Make decisions transparent to the people watching the game   5. Review ref performances after each game What’s the solution for human errror? Are you a human? Have you ever made an error?   Nuer is the best GK of all time and even he made an error last night This isn't even touching on the stuff he did with his daughter's friend. They work for a middle eastern broadcaster so I doubt they give a fuck about sexism Carragher surviving the spitting thing is even more shocking to me but yeah; why anyone watches or cares what these dinosaurs have to say is beyond me. Where is she at now? I thought she was really good, rarely ever got an offside call wrong. Execute him as a warning to future linesmen! Let's be honest, that was not a clear chance as Bayerns final ball for the entire game was terrible and they still had work to do. > Now we're complaining about the protocol not being followed on something that appears to have been the correct call in the end.  Was it the correct call, though? Mazraoui is onside, and de Ligt's offside position is likely to be judged as not interfering with play - so not an infraction. The process for these fine-margin situations leading to the threat of a goal being scored is to let them play out, *then* use the technology available to get to the right decision. So not only was the protocol here fucked up, but it also likely resulted in the *wrong* decision being made. He's in-between rudiger and the ball, which rudiger is running towards. He's definitely not passive. This. I don't get the logic. If a defender at the far side of the pitch is not passive when considering offside... why should De Light who is going for the ball be considered not affecting play? If you're challenging for the ball you're active. The interpretation of that can be debated but I think common sense on this is that Mazraouri challenges for the ball, de Ligt doesn't. Neither touch the ball but only 1 is active He didn't interfere with play at all I've seen that called both ways and I honestly don't know the current state of it. ""Deliberate actions"" by defenders have been enough to rule players onside even if the attacking players presence is clearly the reason they made the action in the first place [deleted] [deleted] by that logic Joselu is offside before his goal since he prevents Pavlovic from moving out sooner (I am not arguing that way, by the way). It's the same when there a three players offside going for the header after a free kick and the one who is scoring the goal isn't. This is also not beeing called back even if defenders had to cover those offside players. I mean people always bring up 2017 but forget that Vidal should have been send off in the first leg and Lewa scored on offside. People saying this conveniently forget bad penalties given to Bayern vs us or the Lewandowski offside that lead to the goal that send the match to extra time in the second leg, etc etc.  In that tie, if we have had VAR back then that Bayern goal wouldnt have counted and there would have been no Ronaldo offsides in extra time. Why does this sub likes to ignore all the decisions that goes against us vs Bayern?  2017 the match doesn't even go into extra time and those 2 offide goals occur if not for an offside goal from Bayern?  Referees favour us? No it's just that they are shit. Madrid with fair refs don't get as many CLs full stop That's not the rule though. De Ligt cuts to the inside, away from the ball.  From an officiating perspective De Ligt is in an offside position, but not offside. I've certainly seen calls where the defender has to act based on an offside player but if they make a deliberate action on the ball the offside player is no longer offside (Kane/lovren is the one that always sticks with me).   The suggestion is the defenders are responsible for being aware the player is offside if they are going to try to play the ball or not.    I think that feels wrong but I don't know what the actual rule is anymore.  You wanting him to be considered active doesn't make it so though. De Ligt wouldn't be considered active because he didn't challenge for the ball. You see the same thing happen across Europe every weekend. You’d a chance not a sure shot goal. There’s a strong possibility Real Madrid defends that or Lunin saves it. >the game would have had a different outcome if it wasn't for the refs mistake  Or not because the reason De Light scores is because... well, Real players think he's offside. They have actively applied the rule though in past UCL and Euro games where the player being a threat presence was enough to rule offsides. So you can post the rules and your interpretation of them wherever you want, but it doesn't change how referees have applied the rule in the past De Ligt clearly attempted to play the ball. Halfway through he decided to break off, but he clearly and unmistakeably tried to play the ball.  I can't comment on Joselu, since I haven't seen that situation.  In any case, even if by letter of the rules this wouldn't have been offside, I submit the rule should be changed. There was already a similar outrageous situation in EPL earlier this year when Rashford was deemed not to be offside. It's easier to be magnanimous about human error if the same human error didn't just get overturned 10 minutes prior. Your comment is excusing this.  This is one of the biggest, if not the biggest fuck up from a referee in thw Champions League within the past 5 years atleast I thought that was good from him tbh, there was a lot of time wasting going on, I'd like them to keep adding time to cover for it, I'm tired of time wasting personally. why the strong animosity am I missing something? I didn't say they are wrong lol. I said them making a graphic that looks like VAR does not make it accurate as VAR. So deciding it's onside just because bein said it is, is wrong. It is a clear mistake from the ref team for sure. The intended pass was in the path of both Mazraoui and De Ligt. Just because De Ligt peeled off and didn't go for it doesn't mean he didn't interfere with play -  you can even see that Mendy has to track both the Bayern players in front of him. He's arguably interfering with rudiger by being in the way of mazraoui and making rudiger unsure of who's gonna get the ball. If it was just mazraoui rudiger likely just shoulders him off the ball and mendy never gets involved If Lunin didn’t put in an effort, isn’t there an equal chance that De Ligt also didn’t put 100% effort into his shot? After all, he heard the whistle as well. So it is, that one is even more obvious too AI refereeing 99% of the game was well refereed, people just making shit up now. You’re correct then, absolutely scandalous decision and he’s had a few howlers already He should never referee an international match again after this mistake. Even the best ref can make mistakes, but not letting this play develop is unforgivable. I'm trying very hard to think of why the ref fucked this up, and I can only think of 2 reasons: incapability or being biased. Both shouldn't be tolerated. That was handball to be fair That was literally handball, you'll pull anything out of your ass now to fuel your narrative? There were also a few substitutions and medical stoppages His knee is off I know, I was being sarcastic because the linesman thought that there was no VAR, so hurried up to raise the flag Yes he does lmao Their fault and what they also admitted to was that they stopped the passage of play, which was wrong. That is the only mistake they committed. I think some of you are getting things mixed up.   You’re suggesting that they knew they had the wrong the decision and actively stopped the play. That’s the only way they’d be able to immediately admit that they made the wrong decision right after the game. Because none of us including the refereeing team had access to the VAR footage. This is not the VAR footage either. Source? It's as if you have incredibly poor reading comprehension. Maybe reread the second sentence over and over again until you get it. You mean what the referee did.  He's responsible. He blew the whistle. The referee blew the whistle seconds before the goal, the Bayern players should have stopped the game and then maybe call on the VAR check. But they continued and because of they made the goal. Its the spirit of the rule for sure. I wonder if they realize that das Spiel keine 90 Minuten dauert!   sepp was so wrong on so many things  ... ⚽️ 😆 Look closer. Next to de ligts knee De Light made the run for the ball, pulling one defender with him.  It doesn't matter if he didn't actually got the ball, it is still an offside. And just like that these lines don’t work. Whatever is onside shouldn’t be poking through. What about it? According to the lines, the right leg isn’t the line. So what are we making up with this graphic? nah. i remember in the past linesman often raises the flag and the ref just overturns it not whistling and the offense scores a goal.  never trust the linesman flag. I guess fact that it was 102 minute and not in extra time made him to whistle it much faster than he would if it was in 70th minute. Match shouldn't be even on at this time.   Everyone was in hurry and he trusted his linesman - because the instructions are, only raise flag if you're absolutely sure. Turned out his linesman made a mistake. But he whistled because he wanted to get game going as fast as possible, to not make this even longer. It does if they follow the protocol for pre-match agreements between the referee and his AR’s when VAR is involved. It’s a major blunder from the assistant referee. when I should be enjoying the win, you're right, instead get to see and hear endless whining and complaining, I'm more neutral than anything but hate to see things end like this for both teams. Rodri, Xavi, Tuchel...such sore losers! It happens more often than it should. See Jude's canceled goal against Valencia https://youtu.be/8FZVh1NEQ8w?feature=shared [deleted] [deleted] ok, then i think VAR should be given more power and the whole movement with each player positioned as before should be played At least they'd know to..... Take it easy. Let's go to the Eagle on VAR  🦅: `There are no mice.`  Thank you, Eagle. Call stands. Release the VAR squawks The US anthem sounds in the background I’d take a sloth at this point What do you mean? African, or European? This might be controversial, but everyone complains about not calling things earlier, specially during aggregate. I think the referee wanted to do that and allow for maximum play. Waiting for VAR is a recommendation precisely because of this, it's left up to the referee to decide.  The ironic thing is that the referee was probably trying to be nice to Bayern and allow for time compensation.  He could have stopped at any point before and no one could have complained. That´s not the procedure. Obviously this shines a pretty big light on a hole in the procedure, being that the assistant refs can not know if something is clearly offside or not. Yeah, what an idiot, Real Madrid famously has 0 fans out side of Madrid. If the ball was headed to him, wouldn't it actually be an easy correct decision? It was the Real player who was heading it away as a way to stop the action, so possibly not fully intentionally and that wouldn't reset the moment when the ball was passed. Unless I am mistaking things here and it wouldn't do it only if it was a deflection. His movement has to be covered the opposing defenders and goalkeeper, he is between defenders involved in the play and the ball. He is moving towards the ball. There is no way in hell he is passive in any shape or form. > The real and inexplicable fuck up is that the refs didn’t let the play finish  Exactly.  Once the whistle goes, doesn't matter what happened prior, the play is dead.  Now, why (a) the AR raised the flag at that point and (b) the ref then blew his whistle are the issues here.  Neither was supposed to do what they did. You are right, that is the fuck-up. Yes that’s the point. Yea...that's the point of the comment you replied to lol. She felt defeated due to how terrible the linesman and ref were. Same thing happened when Ederson fouled Jude, but Jude scored then Ederson pretended he got injured and Jude got a yellow card instead of a goal. Must have been CL season 21'. Hate it when refs immediately stop the fucking game, let it play out you can watch via var afterwards anyway...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-0svroCg-g couldn't they have fixed this with some sort of indirect FK? Yet against Arsenal, the whistle was blown, but the ref didn't give a penalty for a handball in the box because of 'vibes' and 'schoolboy errors'   Get farked. Whistle or not. This is hörde shit whatever way you look at it. [deleted] you can reasonably see where the ball and players would have landed if the play had continued, there was no clear goal scoring opportunity there Good process boys! 1000%. “Oops, i guess Real wins teeheee” And a GK like Neuer knows how to catch a ball. You also claim that error was intentional? Human errors happen. Or if it wasn't, the guy should be fired. That level of incompetence in that important a task would get me fired at work. Don't see why him fucking up at that scale shouldn't be punished too. I started watching CL in 2015. Since then I have seen RM getting the benefit of referee error/decisions in 4-5 crucial matches (Semifinal & final). Tell me why would the newer audience watch this shit? [deleted] it's funny, i wasn't watching the match but just checking the match thread. Most of the comments towards the end were questiong where the added time was coming from and people saying they were playing until Bayner scored. If there really was some conspiracy, why wouldn't the ref have blown the whistle earlier.  People saying Bayern were ""robbed"" is just insane. Robbed of the chance to maybe get a shot off to tie the game at 100+ minutes? that isn't being robbed. Crazy how we would not even be talking about this if De Ligt didn't put it into the back of the net. Like no one would even care that the ref made a mistake I agree.  As far as travesties in Champions League history go, this is pretty far down the list.   Off the top of my head. The quarterfinal between Malaga/Dortmund in '12[?] was the worst.   Lewanowski was blatantly offside.  This was back when they had the away goals rule so Dortmund needed to win.  Malaga was just robbed. Yeah, some are even saying a goal ruled out. ""feel they deserve to go through"" mate were you watching a different game And then Real celebrated for about 2 minutes. So no, it was not excessive indeed.   But I agree with Müller here: it was a big mistake by the ref, but there was not the reason why we lost the game. [deleted] Exactly. They deserved the opportunity The difference is people are saying it was a goal. That Bayern were robbed of a goal. All I'm saying is that it could have been prevented or saved just as much as it could have been a goal. The ball from Mazraoui went to Müller who passed it to De Ligt with already Madrid players being passive in Müllers pass, then DeLight shot with Lunin not even reacting. You're wild if you think Lunin couldn't catch that slow ass shot we saw lol >It would obviously be dumb to say the refs were ""on their side"" or something, but nearly every call that went their way did go their way with the exception of the foul on kimmich.  I mean being serious, the ref allowed 2-3 minutes extra because the game was that exciting and it's not like he shouldn't have carded you for blatantly wasting so much time. Wait, so where's the hat then?? Well, if it is, and it's questionable, that would literally be millimetres if it is... like, actually 2/3mm. And look at the ball in the frame the image is taken from. Please have a look.   The ball has been kicked already. It's almost a foot off the boot of the player passing into the box. Meaning, that knee wouldn't have been offside when the boot made contact with the ball (which is specifically the rule).   I mean, if we're genuinely going to be this pedantic about the offside then let's be comprehensive. Nope that is exactly de Ligts foot - watch closely as the plane gets drawn In that same frame, you can clearly see Rudiger's foot is farther up the pitch than the knee. The larger blur is DeLigt's foot. Only a sliver is the knee. I need to rewatch the whole clip, because what the fuck was De Ligts arms placement if that thing higher is his left arm. Yes. To me this is offside, the attacker torso is past the defender torso.   But I have no idea what the actual rules are anymore, lol. Mazraouis' knee isn't past Rudiger's foot, which is what the guy I replied to is trying to say.  There are a few pixels between Mazraouis' knee and the green offside line. Rudiger's foot is ON the green line, ergo Mazraouis is not offside.  Clearer picture: https://i.imgur.com/pbkOkNV.jpeg Any part of the body that can legally play the ball is what I’ve always been told. I don't think it is. The line on this graphic at least seems to be from the shirt sleeve. I think that's closer to goal than his foot The shoulder/arm part, whatever you want to call it (typically shirt sleeve and up but not always) counts as a playable part of the body. So if that is furthest back, it counts Yeah that's why the referee fked it up. Maybe he spot De Ligt and raised offside flag, and didn't realise that De Ligt did not go for the ball [deleted] The problem with killing refs every time they make a mistake is that it's a thankless job and there aren't a ton of professionally-experienced refs on unemployment just waiting in the wings. So you'd just end up with even less competent refs, a pile of dead bodies, and nobody likes the smell of a pig farm. Replay the match but before the game starts the ref who made the initial mistake gets publically executed by the most popular historical execution method of the country the game is played in. > 2- kill the ref every time he makes a mistake and replace him with a new one   Calm down, General Aladeen Thousands of hours of previous experience before VAR where they were trained to raise the flag. When are they replaying Barça-Chelsea then? This is the worst example.   Like, what the fuck you want to technology to achieve here, give Bayern a drop ball? There was a whistle before the shot, the ball was dead, you can't go and say ""after a review, the ball was still in play even when I clearly signalised it was not. Sorry everyone who stopped playing, you should still defend instead"".   You can repeat an action in volleyball or tennis, because every point is an isolated action. You can't repeat an action in football, because the game is based on time passing. A goal scoring opportunity is not the same as a goal though. Not knowing whether Bayern would have scored or not is tough, but it obviously would have played out differently if the Madrid players hadn't stopped playing.  The best thing for everyone would probably have been if he had put the volley over the bar or something. I feel like him putting it in the back of the net has warped people's views. You can't assume it all would play out the same when defenders stop playing.  The uncertainty is what's going to hurt for Bayern fans. Maybe bayern should have tried to create some goal scoring opportunities in the game, instead of being dominated by real.      You are right that this would have been a good chance and they got fucked over, but the other commentor is still right, blaming this when they played like shit with the ball for almost 90 minutes is just not the right way. a goal scoring opportunity in the 90+12 minute when the ref only gave 9 more minutes lol They had a bunch of chances to affect the outcome. If they choose to focus on something they can't control rather than the variables that are within their own influence; well that's going to lead them to being trophy less again   To paraphrase Connery in the Rock, ""losers whine, winners go home and fuck the prom queen"" >ultimately football isn't decided on xG, and despite the mistakes above, they had one clear chance to get back into the game and take it to extra time,  That was far from a clear chance. In real time, it was obvious everyone stopped playing at the whistle, even bayern players. This was the rare Madrid black magic game where Madrid actually deserved to win. I think the xG ended up being something like Madrid 3.3 — 0.5 Bayern, in large part due to Bayern’s own incompetence. They had a handful of moments where I thought they were going to create a big chance only to piss it away with a bad pass or a poor run. And then obviously Neuer fumbling Vini’s shot for the first Joselu goal.  Overall, I think the teams were evenly matched. Bayern were just sloppy, and Madrid made good use of their opportunities. Simple as that. Bayern was not good enough to win convincingly the tie vs RM is what you are basically saying. They created and deserved that last ditch chance that should have happened regardless of if they were good or not before that.        To me what is wild is dismissing bad calls changing or potentially changing the outcome of a game because a team didnt play perfectly up until that point. The margins at the top level are extremely fine.  When referees continue to make so many errors they are changing the sporting outcomes and undermining the sport. This is true, though I also think it is true that Bayern should never have been given the possibilty as the game should have ended before it even got to that point. There was 9 minutes added time, and four minutes more added on top of that. Even accounting for the VAR situation and the sub made by Madrid, adding another four minutes to the added time was imo too much. You can't control the refs (unless you wear black and white stripes) but you can control your own performance.    Bayern cost themselves the game, not the trigger happy linesman Yea that's my point He showed remorse and did a Sky News interview where the journalist made him cry. The offside rule starts with a very important sentence: ""It is not an offence to be in an offside position"". It becomes an offence when you either play the ball yourself (not the case here with De Ligt) or if you are interfering with an opposition player (stopping him to get to the ball) - which is also not the case here.    This is also the reason why Joselu's second goal in not an issue: he was offside when the ball was played on the wing but wasnt offside when he scored the goal. All defenders are being considered to check offside, while only the relevant attackers are considered, else pretty much every freekick would be offside. Boy some of you really have no clue about the rules of the game you’re watching Because he pulls out of the run so he doesnt end up challenging the defender for it as it lands [deleted] His movement has to be covered the opposing defenders and goalkeeper, he is between defenders involved in the play and the ball. He is moving towards the ball. There is no way in hell he is passive in any shape or form what do you mean? he runs towards the goal and rudiger is forced to cover him, and not go towards mazraoui, how is he not involved in the play ?? Both him and Casemiro were lucky to make it that far into the match, but Vidal even more. He was lucky to not have been sent off before the 30-minute mark. He was being straight-up violent that match. Bayern got the most bullshit of a penalty in the first leg that only gets forgotten because Vidal screwed up the kick. Otherwise it's 2-0 after 45 and a completely different tie.  Casemiro should have also been sent off but wasn’t   Bayern also had 2-3 huge chances that were wrongly called offside  It definitely wasn’t all 100% in Madrids favour, but they certainly benefited more from the referee than Bayern in that tie Which CL don't they get? Name one CL that was won due to refereeing decisions? These narratives are fun to meme about but fall apart once you actually look at the games    There was no controversy in the most recent CL win or 13/14. In 16/17 the only controversial game was the Bayern one, a game in which Madrid absolutely destroyed Bayern over two legs and only went to extratime because Bayern scored an offside goal themselves. Maybe they wouldn't have won the final in 15/16 which had the Ramos offside goal but that goal came with the entire game still left to play so you can't really say definitively what would have happened >	but it doesn’t change how referees have applied the rule in the past  You mean like in the *exact same match* by the *exact same referee* where Joselu was a threat presence while offside when the ball got received by Rudiger?   No offside then, no offside for De Ligt. >	De Ligt clearly attempted to play the ball. Halfway through he decided to break off, but he clearly and unmistakeably tried to play the ball.  He did not. De Ligt was never within “playing distance” of that ball.   “Playing distance” referring to when a player can touch the ball if they stretch their foot/leg or jump according to the IFAB definition.   As he wasn’t in playing distance of the ball, he also didn’t make an attempt to play the ball by outstretching his feet or jumping.   >	It is not an offence to be in an offside position  First sentence on the IFAB page on offsides. You’re allowed to run towards the ball, even when you’re offside.   [See diagram provided by IFAB](https://i.imgur.com/0c2YuKQ.png)  You can run towards a ball even if you’re completely offside, regardless of intent without it being a foul as long as you don’t actually play the ball.   >	I can’t comment on Joselu, since I haven’t seen that situation.  Joselu was in an offside position while the ball got passed and Rudiger played the ball afterwards. Similar situation to the De Ligt one. Rightfully not caled as an offside, even though you could argue he was in the way of defenders or pulling defenders out of their defensive structure from an offside position. Not the same error at all. 10 minutes prior play continued and then a call was made after play stopped.  The point isn't being magnanimous, the point is that it's impossible to remove human error from the game. I didn’t excuse anything. I just said it’s human nature to occasionally make instinctive errors such as this one and there is no hope to eliminate that from the game.    Histrionics don’t change that. its annoying though because bayern were the ones constantly cramping up when they were winning. Funny enough, they didnt have a single injury when they were trailing, they didnt deserve a second of that injury time Would be nice if they had a counter that the ref tracks when play is stopped and deems it to be added at the end. Starts and stops it essentially adding to the time over the course of each half that everyone can see.   And then just use that time for the extra time, and also pause that time when they are in that injury/extra time. Although simple, it does complicate things nonetheless. So not sure the best solution. This sub just gatekeeping shit Ah so you as a Real fan are taking no position, and not suggesting anything. Got it That for sure.  But I doubt that the referee would have found De Ligt to be offside *if* (and that we will never know) it results in a goal without the whistle. > Just because De Ligt peeled off and didn't go for it doesn't mean he didn't interfere with play  For the offside rules, this is a major difference. De ligt is not directly interfering the play so offside on him doesn't count. ""Making someone unsure"" isn't a factor for offside. So it really doesn't matter. Why wouldn't he? His team was out, he had to try, for him it was as he said, first try it and then if it's offside it's offside. fuck that noise This was my one big takeaway. Very literally until that moment, there was a flurry of comments on the match thread saying how well the game had been refereed. Now, he’s suddenly a terrible ref with a terrible track record. No they’re not lool, they’re quite rightly questioning how such a mad decision can be made regardless if the rest was good or bad   You like defending refs are like the people who defend coppers shooting innocent civilians Whose knee is off? Because that very much matters here.  Also, you do realize the line isn't drawn properly, right? Can clearly see the sole of Rüdiger's shoe through their weirdly placed barrier. He doesn't. He doesnt try to play the ball, nor prevents any Real Madrid player from doing so > Their fault and what they also admitted to was that they stopped the passage of play, which was wrong. That is the only mistake they committed. I think some of you are getting things mixed up.  Yep you're completely right. It's still an appauling call nonetheless. Based on the flag of the assistant referee VAR doesn't get involved in general offsides calls. Only when it involves a goal or penalty kick. So Bayern players did the right thing by playing on. What? No , as far as I am concerned the player in offside has to Touch the ball for it to count as offisde, If there was another player in offside but the player onside is still onside the game continues, go watch on YouTube have soem players tricked the opponents with 1 player being offside and another player who's onside comes running and scoring > Match shouldn't be even on at this time.  It's *minimum* added time - and given a solid three minutes went to a VAR check and two bookings, it's perfectly within the rules to add that time on. There is a review of that situation from an expert that explains 2 mistakes were made. 1 by the linesman and the other by the head referee that while he saw the flag he still should have let the play go on until it ended. Sorry but I think the expert that was literally only called to review the situation knows it better than you. You should still be able find that video somewhere on this sub. Ignore it... Idk what else to say it's reddit everyone wants to say same things in new ways Based  honestly, this sub has become more about complaining about refs than actual footy, just pointless whining and toxicity  who gives a shit honestly I'd like to know why it was called offsides so early, but I can't tell you why No one is sure why the whistle had Already Gone. Linesman needs to get his Lyin' Eyes checked. This decision left nobody with a Peaceful Easy Feeling. The Madrid camp is especially Desperado to move on and start talking about the final. Son of a bitch… One of these nights they’ll figure it out.  Lol It's Cap'n Jack Sparrow actually Referees and their assistants are specifically instructed to let fine-margin situations leading to scoring threats like these unfold, precisely because they've got VAR to check - so for the assistant to raise his flag and the referee then blow his whistle is two massive errors. >but everyone complains about not calling things earlier  People (including me) complain about this, but it's about obvious decisions in the 55th minute of the game. The ones where the player is a yard or two offsides and it's not called. I think anything in ""crunch time"" (late in the second half, stoppage time, extra time) should have the refs just let play go on and allow VAR to sort it out. you're right, they secretly wanted RM to win.  Lmao this sub man.  Morons. >There is no way in hell he is passive in any shape or form.  Look, if I had any power to rewrite the law, I'd change it so what you are saying mattered, because I agree that of course he is actually involved in play. He isn't passive, and his movement effects the defenders.  But that isn't how the law currently works. It used to, but not now.   The definition of involved in play in the current rule means that the ball goes to you and you directly interact with it. If you are in an offside position and aren't the first attacking player to interact with the ball, there is no offside given. Once an attacking player interacts with the ball, a new phase of play is started and it only matters if you are offside now in this new phase - not in the previous phase of play.  It's silly, but that's what the current rule is. And going by the current rule, De Ligt was not offside when he actually received the ball, as a new phase of play had started. These refs do this for a living. It should be drilled into them at this point through training and practice that you don't just raise your flag that easily in an attack. I don't understand how that can be their first instinct in such a critical moment. No obviously not after the whistle has gone They aren't talking about this event https://youtu.be/td7OXoBxnwE?si=gJ0RgpW6l-NqZdHp Not at all comparable, but go off! Care to mention some more examples? Lol, bs. [deleted] How can you have an opinion on a match you didnt watch. Maybe dont type anything.  >Most of the comments towards the end were questiong where the added time was coming from and people saying they were playing until Bayern scored.  Congratz, most people here are fucking idiots. Nice to see you notice it.  Robbery can simply mean any obvious bad call in a game.  And it IS an egregious and horrible mistake by multiple refs that shouldnt ever happen in the age of VAR, there is really no excuse for this level of incompetence. Yes Bayern were robbed off that chance, just because it doesnt fulfill your arbitrary treshhold of a chance being big enough, doesnt make it any less of an mistake. Malaga scored an [offside](https://youtu.be/wnA7j3NUmmo?si=0TtOikWQaRCFkJx1&t=549) themselves in the very same game, so i wouldn't call it robbed. It was a very bad call. No question. What concerns me more as a fan is that 3 of the 4 goals we conceded were due to absolutely appalling individual errors, and the 4th goal was due to our tactical genius playing an 8-0-2 formation so no one knew where to play or who to mark. We beat ourselves, and the bad call took away one of the many chances for us to redeem ourselves. I think as fans we're just bummed all the way around, and those of us who have been around for awhile and didn't migrate over with Tuchel, we've been bummed since March of last year. For me, I've been bummed since 2017 when the Robbery-Lahm-Basti/Alonso era started ending. What does that have to do with anything?  I’m literally talking about the manager lying to keep confidence up….  Your response makes no sense. He did that at +11 You're the only one on this chain saying that? Other people are saying that Bayern were robbed of a goal scoring opportunity.  There's a difference. Even neuer makes mistakes, there's really no way to know.  You are wild if you think the shot would have been like that without the whistle. Watch it again, and you'll notice even the shooter reacted to the whistle and half-assed the shot.  We will never know because the whistle was blown when it shouldn't have. I mean we time wasted when we were up, true, then real time wasted when they were up, then when they score the second the celebrations plus the VAR check took 2 minutes so yeah, the extra bit was just him giving the extra time originally guaranteed which was 9 and it went 11 over so it tracks. > I mean being serious, the ref allowed 2-3 minutes extra because the game was that exciting   It's *minimum* added time - and a solid three minutes of stoppages in added time were spent on a VAR check and two bookings. It's perfectly within the laws of the game for referees to add time for stoppages onto the already added time. Yeah, that's why this post should be removed, as it's not remotely accurate (title) and isn't definitive one way or another. > I mean, if we're genuinely going to be this pedantic about the offside then let's be comprehensive.  Should probably start with where the line is drawn, I reckon - because it's clearly not where it's supposed to be with how the sole of Rüdiger's boot is poking through. No, it's not. [Orange is pointing at the foot, red is at a knee.](https://i.imgur.com/ybsaImp.png) It's very small (the knee), but its there. Well, at least you've spotted the right knee now. Ah, that actually makes perfect sense.  So hypothetically your shoulder can be used as the last body part to keep someone onsides, but nothing below the shoulder.  Interesting. Possibly, but if his arm is closer to goal than his foot then his foot shouldn't show through the plane if it is drawn correctly?  Basically I think I can see Rudiger's foot goal-side of the plane, which means either I'm wrong or the graphic is wrong, which could be that they've drawn it wrong from the right point, or drawn it right but from the wrong point. Oh, ok. I misinterpreted what you were saying. the commentator was like ""i'm pretty sure there's a rule against putting it up for the stadium""  Marciniak said ""fuck that I don't want to get stabbed after the match""  Honestly, there's no reason why they shouldn't show it to the stadium.  No one can argue that Nacho's hands were all over Kimmich's face.  Sure, he went down easy, but in that scenario it's a foul.  From how the stadium reacted, there wasn't much complaint after seeing the replay. Exactly. Even the stooter stopped playing at the whistle. You can tell, that was a half-hearted effort. It only blew up because it went into the net. This incident just shows how reactionary and fragile some fans are. If the ball went wide or over the net, the outrage wouldn't be half what we see right now. But it went in, so there is. However, where the ball went after the whistle was blown should not matter. I also think that’s a weird take: were they the better team? Nah. Did they play it exactly as they wanted to? Definitely. And if Neuer doesn’t drop that ball everyone would applaud the tactic for how you play and frustrate a Real Team at home.  I don’t think they played like shit at all. They did have too many inaccurate passes, though. That’s for sure. They’re playing Real Madrid dumbass, not Freiburg. Of course they can get dominated. I’m not even a Bayern fan but that’s a really dumb take Right, and most of the interviews I've seen the Bayern players etc admit it wasn't the best performance going forward especially, but teams win games all the time whilst being the 'worse' team. Yeah it's a centre back taking a shot at a world class shot stopper with like 2 defenders trying to stop him This is why xG sucks. What was the xg of that botched counter? And what was the xG of the De Light shot? With that being said you are right. All of these are true: Bayern fumbled, Real deserved the win and the lineman and ref made a horrific, unforgivable mistake. That’s not what I’m saying at all. Madrid beat City and not convincingly at all. I’m saying that if you pinpoint your loss because of a human err, then it is what it is. Life is about making your own luck and being persistant. Madrid has been doing this for decades and it translates to their « 14 » on the sleeve. When you have humans involved, there are errors. It is what it is. Really? I think, if you go back and watch the added time and tally up the stoppages inside of added time.. ref got it pretty spot on. Yes, and their performance literally included this chance... The decision by the trigger happy linesman still potentially had an impact on the outcome of the game though. Sorry lol >  (stopping him to get to the ball)  That's very much your interpretation of what interference of an opposing player means. Someone making a run at a ball so the defender has to follow is interfering a play, since the defender is reacting to someone in an illegal position. It's definitely not like that, the interference doesn't have to be so direct as you mentioned.  Joselu's goal wasn't an issue because he was far away from the ball. But De Ligt is impacting the defenders ability to go for the ball, they have to position themselves to mark him and he makes a play for the ball. Ref shouldn't have blown, but if it is a goal, I could see it being ruled offside. Then why does it even matter if Mazraoui was on or offside? The old offside rule applied to any attacker involved or not and it was changed for good reason Right? This was a wild take. But if he starts making an active move towards the ball at all he's affecting the decision making of the defender that makes him an active player, even if he ends up pulling back before getting to the ball. Doesn't matter, if he's in ANY way in the way of the defender's path to the ball, it's offside. Whether that happened here, can't tell from that replay and honestly don't remember how they stood from last night.  (doesn't matter in the discussion of whether the ref should've blown the whistle or not - he shouldn't have; nor whether the play would've actually amounted to anything had Madrid's players not stopped playing)  To sum up: - whether it was offside or not doesn't even matter - blowing the whistle was wrong - there is absolutely no way of knowing what happens on the play if Madrid players don't stop (whistle was blown before Műller even headed the ball)  IMO, an awful call - but there's a very good chance that it didn't change anything. Madrid still had 2 CBs and a GK to stop the play, all of which stopped playing when the whistle blew. According to current interpretations taught to referees, simply moving toward the ball is not considered interfering with play or with an opponent—even if defenders are following.  Unsighting the goalkeeper *is* considered interfering with an opponent. The rules have a particular provision for unsighting a player. Not about ""influencing defenders movements"" though [deleted] He is involved in the football match, yes, running there on the pitch with the other players, having fun. But he wasn't offside.  You can look at it in this way: he was potentially offside. He started a  run that would have put him offside had he gone for the ball. But he stopped that run, became passive, the play reset when someone else touched the ball, and boom; he was onside again. [deleted] 17/18  15/16  Madrid get favoured during matches which also helps make them look like they dominate.  The only time I've seen somewhat equal reffing for Madrid is when they play city I disagree philosophically that you have to be within the distance of the ball to \*attempt\* to play it. What if you are a foot out, but you stretch your leg, and it blocks the defender kicking the ball? Be that as it may, that should imply that referees should never flag early, but they do - e.g. some scenarios are given here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Referees/comments/12w4tld/when\_do\_you\_raise\_the\_flag\_for\_offsides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Referees/comments/12w4tld/when_do_you_raise_the_flag_for_offsides/)  That to me shows a serious flaw in the rules. (and unrelated, but it puts a defender in an unfair position). Yeah. It is. It's the exact same refereeing actions being made by both each linesman and referee and the exact same human error leading to a reverse decision happening in the exact same game. Yep that’s when it should cancel out and if both teams can’t play actual football during regulation time then don’t give them more. That would be another controversial one. You would have people saying it is a clear positional offside and others saying what you said.  However...doesn't UEFA have automatic OS tech for CL? Why don't they show it in this case??? Blocking vision and space is though He didn't, watch the replay and you'll notice he does in fact react to the whistle, then decides to continue anyways. The shot seems half-assed after you notice that.  It's a done deal anyways and we will never know because the whistle was wrongly blown. That's the problem. The ref in the first leg was pretty much perfect. Marciniak was pretty much perfect until this moment (and this wasn’t even entirely his fault). The only other mistake in my estimation was that he let the game go on too long. I think he should have given the final whistle around 90+11 or 90+12. Two things can be true. He refereed a great game up until that point, but then he made one of the worst decisions I've seen in recent years. They did fuck up that part in the first half where there seemed to be two balls in play at the same time, and I think Rodrygo hit the post off that chance.  Wasn't a massive issue, but it was weird how they handled that If a pilot flys well for 99% of a travel and then smacks the plane into the runway in the final second, no one says ""well he was good for the most part"". I realised now, I agree that he is onside. Shit refereeing from the linesman Ohhhh, I’m looking at the wrong fucking guy, ignore me Oh shit. You're right. I apologize for being a dumb fuck. What you say is also true, but a referee whistle is a referee whistle… Here are the actual offside rules according to [IFAB](https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/offside/#offside-position)  And here is the part that matters in this specific case:  > interfering with an opponent by:  > challenging an opponent for the ball or  > clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or  Are you gonna tell me that De Light didn't clearly challenge for the ball? Or that Rudiger didn't go for De Light because of that? My point isn’t if it’s a mistake or not, my point is that the referee and linesmen have agreed on a list of things that you go through before the game, one of those points is keep the flag down if it’s a close offside.  So Marciniak assumes, that when Listkiewicz raises his flag, that it’s an obvious offside, because that’s what the trio agreed upon. It's because these morons don't know the rules and hardly follow any football outside of social media, so all they can do is resonate whichever opinion is the loudest. Too early or too late, they certainly enjoy when they Take It To The Limit So they couldn’t review it Money [deleted] Yes, my point is that he didn't deem it fine margin because of perspective. It is a mistake, but the rules allow them to act that way for a reason. I think it's precisely during crunch time when people complain the most or it's most relevant, that time can't be added back. My point is that the linesman thought it was clear from his perspective, and raised the flag so the referee could decide (as probably instructed). It's a mistake for sure, but I fear this might cause referees to never raise a flag. I don't like that because injuries might come from unnecessary play. It seems a lot of people are using this interpretation. I genuinely went to look if there is any source for that. But what I'm getting is that:  A player is considered to be attempting to play the ball if they make a clear action to touch or gain control of the ball. This can include actions such as:  * Stretching a leg or arm towards the ball. * Running towards the ball. * Any physical movement aimed at intercepting or playing the ball.  Maybe I'm out of date, and I'm also finding out of date references. If that is the case, I apologize. > These refs do this for a living.  Actually they have real jobs they do for a living. Refereeing is something they do in their free time. Marciniak for example is a businessman. Bayern vs RM 2017 [deleted] Just because it fulfills your arbitrary-Bayern-fan treshhold of a Bayern chance being big enough, doesnt mean you were robbed a ""chance"", it was a play at most.  I watched the game including the controversial play and I saw nothing about a clear opportunity. In fact it's not about Mazraoui, it's about De Light who also intervenes in the pass, and it's an offside as clear as daylight.  Do not pretend this was some sort of disallowed goal. It was not a flagrant error, this was all about protocol, nothing else. And with these fine margins anyone can't say for certain if the linesman saw the offside clear enough. He was there, you and I were not, and images seem to favour there was no incorrect call at all - in the sense of the rightness of the play itself.  You've got they also exceded the protocol when adding all that extra time over the extra time. The ref signaled 2 more minutes when at the 10th minute of a 9th added game time, De Light's play was in the 13th. I think that's enough to say the play came from a controversial added time already too.  And don't get me started about the losing time aspect because that's the reason 2 more minutes were added. If you start adding over and over you may have expected Bayern to equalize sooner or later. That was ALSO against common law. where did i express my opinion on the match?  It's funny you saying most people here are fucking idiots and then saying a robbery can be any obvious bad call in a game. That is most definitely not what a robbery is.  i'm not sure you even read my comment properly, i never said it wasn't a big msitake from the ref. [deleted] And I'm saying he shouldn't feel like he needs to say that to get that outcome, Madrid were much better plus Bayern had already subbed out their threats. Kimmich did dive. Where's the lie? The guy is just calling out people who say they were robbed of a goal. And he's correct to do it >I mean we time wasted when we were up, true, then real time wasted when they were up, then when they score the second the celebrations plus the VAR check took 2 minutes so yeah,  And then added two minutes but after those two minutes passed, he just kept the match going...  It doesn't really check, he literally added two minutes extra because he felt like it *after* he himself had already added two minutes for the Var and Madrid's celebration. It’s enough to know it shouldn’t have been whistled short, and also should’ve been onside if reviewed Well, I think you start with the action that initiates the offside, and that's the ball being kicked. If you get the frame/image wrong then any lines being drawn are nonsense. Oh I see now, yeah thats really really small. Millimeters stuff The guy said *Mazraouis' knee* and Rudiger's foot were *beyond* the line. Mazraouis' knee isn't beyond the line, De Ligt's knee is.  What's so hard to understand here? You're the one spotting the wrong knee. To make it even more complicated they claim the shoulder ends at the shirt sleeve so technically part of the arm could be considered your shoulder . I’ve been told it’s why some defenders prefer long sleeves 😂 I think what is happening is if you look at de ligt its as if they've cut his outline through the offside plane so that you can actually see him.  This is visible between De Ligts' leg and arm, near his head as well and around Rudigers arm. I think we can see rudigers' white socks through this gap, and it isn't meant to be visible as if it had broken the plane. His foot, I think, follows this, but tbh I'm not 100% sure  But truth be told, it doesn't really matter. I can't see anything of Mazraoui offside. So either it goes from his arm and it's onside, or it goes from his foot, and it's even more onside I am sorry, but if the same situation happened in reverse you would be livid. If my mother had balls she would’ve been my father. They played defensively tactically, that is what they wanted. But they certainly didn't want to have nothing going on when having the ball yourself.   And really, even defensively they had to be saved by neuer multiple times. They were by far the inferior team, them somehow advancing would have been extremely lucky. Real is playing Bayern, not Levante. They shouldn't be able to dominate so easily. Madrid shouldn't have won their ties against City if you go by what is ""likely"" to happen. Yeah, I think about 30s of the first 4 minutes of stoppage time were actually played. By using that logic the original added time should probably not have been 9 minutes, more like 25. Because there were plenty of stoppages in the second half with the VAR and 7 substitutions before the added time started and the time wasting by Bayern after they scored. So you either have to agree that the amount added originally was too short or the 4 minutes was too much, correct? And it was already added 9 minutes, so 4 minutes is too much with that logic. The wording of the rule is the following (Law 11):  A player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched by a team-mate is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by:   - interfering with play by playing or touching a ball passed or touched by a team-mate or.   - interfering with an opponent by:   * preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or challenging an opponent for the ball or   * clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or   * making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball   * gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent when it has: rebounded or been deflected off the goalpost, crossbar or an opponent been deliberately saved by any opponent The limits of influencing the play are so muddled these days too, if you impede the goalies line of sight from an offside position it’s no goal, correct? Even if the nearest defender is 10 feet away and the shot is from outside the box. I can’t imagine being directly behind the defender going for the ball while going for the ball yourself is passive just because you don’t touch it Idk what games you've been watching but de ligt never touches or goes to play the ball in this play, there's no chance they would have said he's interfering Mazraoui plays the ball from an onside position so the ball is still alive when he passed it to de Ligt. That's a very personal interpretation.   That passive offside rule leads in some situation to clear advantages caused by an offside position, that are not exactly the spirit of the game. To plays that are near impossible to defend for defenders, with CF and forwards able to be meters ahead of the defensive line at the start of plays and being impossible to catch up to when they receive a cross. And to situations that could be interpreted differently, like this De Ligt position here.  At least it was black and white back then. Not really. People insisted the Rashford one vs City was a clear offside even though he didn't touch the ball last season if you look at it that way, you can start giving offsides for everything. De ligt did his best to not affect the play or challenge for the ball.   Joselu was in offside position when the ball was played to rudiger. His position definitely affected bayern defenders, but its still not offside of course. That's a fair comment, but that's also never how it's refereed though. You have to challenge for the ball or prevent an opposition player from playing it. Simply running towards the goal isn't enough to be considered active. You can certainly make that argument but he doesnt run with the defender, no way a ref actually chalks it off I don’t think just making a run is enough, if he kept going to the ball then sure, but if you’re just counting making runs then almost every free kick should be called offside. There’s about 2-3 players offside from every free kick, it’s never called if the scorer isn’t as long as the offside players aren’t blocking the keepers vision or blocking a defender from challenging. Yeah, you are right. Another poster linked me the the rules:   [https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-11---offside](https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-11---offside)  And I stand corrected I rewatched it, and maybe you are right. Anyways it's quite a tough call 3) attempt to play the ball  A player is considered to be attempting to play the ball if they make a clear action to touch or gain control of the ball. This can include actions such as:  * Stretching a leg or arm towards the ball. * Running towards the ball. * Any physical movement aimed at intercepting or playing the ball. Which game in 17/18 lol what?   That Juventus penalty was a clear penalty   Madrid dominated both legs of normal time against Bayern in 16/17 because of bad ref decisions that happened in extra time??? Strange take Try to read dickgilberts comment again but more slowly this time. The main issue was that because the ref blew the whistle they couldn’t use VAR or the technology at all, so we’ll never know officially, just by this would be the closest we could get. I think this probably would’ve been onside, but who knows > That would be another controversial one. You would have people saying it is a clear positional offside and others saying what you said.  There surely would be discussions. But based on the rules and guidelines, I don't think De Ligt was offside (as in an offside you should call). He didn't hinder a defender to play the ball, he didn't challenge one and he didn't *clearly* attempt to play the ball when it was *close* and while impacting another opponent. Yes. And you'd have a point if the ball didn't go over De Ligts head, clearly visible for Rüdiger. 90+12:30 imo, but agree that he let it go for slightly longer than ideal. Either way the ref did very well overall; even this error isn't entirely his fault at worst and isn't his fault at all at best Exactly. I’m not saying two mistakes make one right but this whole situation shouldn’t have even happened in the first place.   The game should have ended because when it was 99’ he signaled 2 more and then let this incident happen in the 13th additional minute. Completely unnecessary. I don’t disagree. But definitely some insane revisionism. It’s also just a function of most people having watched/read about just this moment and the number of people who watched the entire game is a lot less. How is blowing the whistle early the same as crashing a plane full of people?  Also, I’m talking about the discourse being about how good a referee he is in general immediately shifting to “knew it mate, he’s always been shit” I know that. However their agreement which is based on trust is simply not t an acceptable argument in that kind of situation. I hate how everything Redditors discover suddenly gets a whiny and bitchy aura Ain't no place for VAR to hide their Lyin' Eyes They were making an Eagles pun.  Unless you made one too and I don't recognize the song lol No worries, it's confusing as the rule is stupid.   You can find the current rule here: https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-11---offside  You can see that it really stresses you have to be directly engaging with the ball or close enough to do so while trying to, or be directly impeding a defender from reaching the ball.   Just drawing defenders away to create spaces does not count as being active, as silly as that is, because you aren't directly engaging with the ball or blocking a defender from doing so.   And this is the way the rule is mostly implemented, and is meant to be implemented. There is still an element of subjective decision making, of course, and refs and linesmen do implement wrong not infrequently. [deleted] Bayern scored off-side to send it to extra time that same game.  Also you mentioned 4-5 by awarding them the contentious penalties. or any advantageous foul so that they can have more and better chances. The refs are supposed to let play continue, they didnt, how is that not an obvious error? Even WE, a day later and with images cant say if Maz is clearly offside, the fuck are you on about ""with these fine margins anyone can't say for certain if the linesman saw the offside clear enough"".     Am I talking to fucking toddlers? I also never said or pretended it was a sure goal, stop arguing against imaginary opposition, this reads like rambles of a lunatic. Again what does this have to do with anything? People only hating cause they're tired of Madrid's stronghold on the UCL. [deleted] Fair. >The guy said Mazraouis' knee and Rudiger's foot were beyond the line. Mazraouis' knee isn't beyond the line, De Ligt's knee is.  Right, the two of you are disagreeing about the position of the knee of Mazraouis in relationship to Rudigers foot. That's a debate the two of you can have amongst yourselves. But trying to argue that the person explicitly talking about Mazraouis' knee isn't talking about Mazraouis' knee makes you sound a little confused. Especially considering there really is only one knee particularly relevant to this discussion. Kinda Well, it did. How 90s of her. Agree to disagree! I already said they were not the better team but I don’t agree with ‘by far inferior’. Sure, Neuer had 3 great saves (I don’t count the double save cause I don’t think that goal would have stood since the ball was never in the side out). But Kane makes one or two of those any day. Either way. I don’t think there’s an argument from me that the better team won, but the margins were small. Unlikely things happen. That doesn't make other unlikely things more likely. You sound like a gambling addict I'll have to rewatch the highlights of the 2nd half and tally up the stoppages but I'm fairly sure that ~10 mins stoppage was accurate.. plus the extra time added to stoppage for the stoppages within that 10 mins.  So, I guess, no, I don't agree with you (yet). Thanks for posting this i guess, as you can see interfering with the play can be interpreted in many other ways than just, as you put it,  ""stopping a defender to get the ball"". Feels like De Ligt could be classified as  making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball since Rudiger has to decide which player to track when the ball is in the air.     Ref and lino clearly messed up though, definitely should have let it play out. > * preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or challenging an opponent for the ball or  So it's an offside. Unless you think that sprinting towards the ball in a race with the opposition defender, but eventually pivoting is suddenly not a challenge... Touching the ball never matters. And he does go fir ball, he clearly runs offside right before ball is played which definitely impacts where the defenders go. If de ligt wasn't there, ir was 5 yards offside standing still,I don't think mazroui can take the ball as cleanly as he does. Mazraoui does not play the ball at all.. Back then you would have offside called because someone on the other side of the pitch completely uninvolved was offside.    The game was massively improved by changing that part of the rule.   The situation you have described doesn't even make sense. For the CF in that scenario to not be offside someone must have caught up to them, either defenders or a team mate with the ball who would have needed to be onside themselves initially. You don't have to touch the ball to be offside... Rashford was clearly interfering with the play. Yeah, and that’s because they don’t understand the game they’re watching. The final against Liverpool, pretty difficult to play when the other team can just injure your players with zero repercussions  But no, Madrid get ref favours all the time, minor ones especially which all add up Lol what did I miss buddy. Please. The linesman raised the flag and the ref didn't blow the whistle, the linesman raised the flag and the ref did blow the whistle. The semantical differences are so great they just simply couldn't be compared. But I remember in other ocasions UEFA has come after the game to explain controversial plays. Having that technology they could explain whether it was offside or a clear mistake.  It seems a bit shady otherwise. De Light was offside, the reason why he **doesn't hinder a defender to play the ball** it's because Militao stops when the whistle is blown and only moved again once he realizes  Bayern are continuing to play. I'm talking about blocking vision of the other attacker I stand corrected. Thanks, you are a true gentleman https://www.transfermarkt.com/szymon-marciniak/werdegang/schiedsrichter/1964 Okay the madrid gloryhunters are on a downvoting spiral even after asking for examples (which is good because typically you just get a ""cry"" from them and they have no arguments in their favor).  So first of all, in 2017 Muller and Lewandowski clear 1v1's called falsely offside, Ronaldo 2 offside goals, Casemiro not getting booked even after multiple reckless challenges when he deserved a red in the fırst half, Vidal laughable wrong red card. One offside goal in favor of Bayern compared to this doesn't seem much, eh? Most rigged match in football history.  2016 Ramos offside goal, game goes to extra time at 1-1. So, with VAR Atletico win.  2018. Psg were denied a clear penalty (ramos handball) Real madrid also got a wrong penalty from a dive.  Against Juve, Juve came back from 3-0 to 3-3 and they call a 50/50 position as a penalty in the last minute. Benatia got the ball at the same time as he has marginal contact to Vazquez from the back. Refs wouldn't call that a penalty in that situation for any other team. AGAIN against bayern penalties denied in both legs. Most notable one being a clear Marcelo handball. Real won by one goal and away goal existed back then.  2022 against PSG Benzema pushes Donnarumma to get the ball which started the comeback. A push like that is usually a foul for any player anywhere on the pitch, but here it was against a GOALKEEPER IN THE BOX and everyone knows they have more of an immunity compared to other players. Game on.  2024 against Leipzig multiple clear cardable fouls called against Madrid and most notably Vinicius double face-push (ball nowhere near the players) not given a red. Switch roles, that's a red after the first push. Against Bayern again multiple clear counter-attack stopping fouls by Real not carded once. Nacho hands on the face of Kimmich, no card. These are minor things of course when compared to the last incident where a clear goalscoring chance is called off prematurely, against the current rules of the game. Position in 90+13 to tie the game and line as close as it can be.  Real madrid have gotten this blatant favoritism since the 60's when the tournament was organized around them and it is not talked about enough whatsoever. The ""fans"" use ""cry"" as their best argument against it FFS😭🤣 Offside goal against AM in final  2 controversial refereeing decisions vs Juve in final.   Bayern were robbed too in 2018 as well.  Mo-Salah deliberately injured in 2018 final The protocol is let the ball play if it's dubious.  You're arguing it can't be said Maz is offside. That's your first mistake. It's De Light's position as I already mentioned. Am I the one speaking to a wall?  Yes, it's fine margin, but yes, that's relative as everything. What is not relative is if it's offside or not. Given images it seems it was, therefore it seems it was a correct call.  See, if you wanna prove there's an error first you gotta give evidence of the mistake. You're not.  ""He should have let the game play"" I mean, maybe, and he should have stopped before the 13th minute too. Both things didn't happen as it may have given common, expected law (= protocol, for you to understand), but protocol is debatible. If it was offside, and I stand my point it was, you have no evidence it was tight enough for the linesman nor the ref to let the game go on. If it had been onside you'd have every reason to complain vigorously.  Get over it and move on. It didn't take over two minutes but not only that, the ref then decided to add just two minutes, then he simply changed his mind mid game. > But trying to argue that the person explicitly talking about Mazraouis' knee isn't talking about Mazraouis' knee makes you sound a little confused  He is confusing De Ligt's knee with Mazraouis' knee which is what I've been saying all along. He's the confused one. Well you don't need to add those stoppages yourself, you just go to UEFAs website. They show that the ball was in play 36 minutes in the first half, and about 30 minutes the second half (including the added 14 minutes). So even if the ball was in play for 0 minutes in the added time there still isn't enough, so either there was too little time added originally or too much on top of the original amount. Or are you arguing that there should be different rules during the added time compared to before? True. But it was the only relevant one. If a player is in an offside position, defenders will still have to think about him, the question is ""does de Ligt block Rudiger from playing the ball ?"" - to me he isnt. VAR may have concluded differently. He is not preventing the defender to get to the ball. Him running next to the defender in an offside position while not disturbing the defender is not considered an offside offence.    Would you consider Joselu's second goal offside ? Joselu is doing as much interference by the letter of the law than de Ligt is here. Of course Neuer and Rudiger have to adjust because there is a player, but they are not obstructed by them [deleted] It has never been called like that in the past, why would it be called like that here? Take a set piece situation, where everyone is running for the ball. It doesn't matter if someone is onside if the goal scorer isn't. The offside runners influence the play as much as De Ligt in your view does here. I'll change my mind if I can see an instance where for example said set piece is ruled offside because someone other than goalscorer being offside without getting to the ball. Wait isnt the sequence Mazraoui header to Muller to de Ligt who ""scores"" ? >Back then you would have offside called because someone on the other side of the pitch completely uninvolved was offside.   I disagree with that. Football is not a 1v1 sport, any movement from the opponent has an impact on the defenders and change the way the whole team defend.   Like on that De Ligt case here, if this was really considered allowed you could make it a strategy : two forwards make a run for the ball with one a bit hidden behind the first one that is offside and that stops running after a few meters. Those few meters would be enough to confuse the defenders thinking the first player is offside, and have them lose the advantage they had initially on the second player.   >The situation you have described doesn't even make sense. For the CF in that scenario to not be offside someone must have caught up to them, either defenders or a team mate with the ball who would have needed to be onside themselves initially.  We don't even need to look far : look at Joselu's last goal yesterday. He is in an offside position, and thus at least a  meter ahead of the defenders that can't catch up to him when Rudiger crosses. It's clearly allowed by the current passive offside rule, and it's smart movement by Joselu in the current era, but it's also very clearly an advantage given by his offside position. And near impossible to defend for defenders.   For me it's against the spirit of the game. Nah I still dont get this - Ramos is pushed into Karius. And the tussle between Ramos and Salah was 50/50. Get off it mate Ah ok I haven’t seen anything like that before. I think that they would just give a basic “ref messed up” or something like that, I doubt they would draw the lines for the public, or give the explanation as a clear mistake to protect the refs. Definitely do agree that more clarity from UEFA would make this much more clear/digestible for Bayern player/fans That's a very wrong timeline of the call.  It's Mazraoui challenging for the ball while De Ligt stops his run and cuts into the middle. During the subsequent header to De Ligt the whistle is blown.  The only situation where De Ligt could have been offside was the one where he cut into the middle. After that, it was a new situation. Then that is irrelevant because the rules say ""blocking vision to play the ball"", not ""blocking vision of attackers"". Glad to be of help! The Ramos offside goal I can concede but the 2017 game, again, there were calls against them that cost them too. The rest is all ticky tacky. You're just trolling with that last one lol. Delulu. The Marcelo handball in 2018 is often forgotten too.  He even admitted it was intentional, but the narrative was overshadowed by Ulreich blunder. Let's say the ref would've let the game run and De Ligt scored. In this case it wouldn't have mattered whether he was offside in this scene, as Mazraoui played the ball. No way any ref calls a goal back in this situation for something that can be interpreted as passive offside.     Btw, even if he was 2m offside the protocol is to let these situations run. Just like they did on Madrid's second goal. [deleted] > He is confusing De Ligt's knee with Mazraouis' knee which is what I've been saying all along.  Yes, and since it's very obviously not what's going on, that makes you sound confused. > They show that the ball was in play 36 minutes in the first half, and about 30 minutes the second half (including the added 14 minutes)  Never knew these reports existed so that was pretty cool to read. What I picked up, straight away, is that they don't give any context about the stoppages so would still have to go back and actually watch the game to see what he stoppages were for. Otherwise, just looking at their numbers, you're arguing that there should only have been ~7 mins total stoppage which isn't right at all because that report doesn't include some of the stoppages for the many fouls and offsides inside the regular time and stoppage time.  But if just the scoring and sub stoppage times in regular time add up to ~7 mins and the you factor in all the other little things like the fouls, the offisides, then 10+ mins starts looking more actual than not. I do think I’m splitting hairs at this point, and I cant confidently say whether I’m right or wrong, but if the phrasing is clearly impacts, I don’t think that can be restricted to just blocking >Would you consider Joselu's second goal offside ? Joselu is doing as much interference by the letter of the law than de Ligt is here.  I mean.. the difference is that the ball goes towards general area where De Ligt is so he makes a run even though he's offside. Meanwhile Joselu is just standing in the box, completely disconnected from the game. The ball is nowhere near and actually goes away from him even further in the pre-final pass from Carvajal to Rudi. And by the time Rudi gets the ball Joselu is behind it so there's no offside. He is literally influencing Rüdiger's decision-making because De Light is actively chasing for a ball and having a one-on-one sprint battle with Rüdiger.  No, I don't consider Joselu's position the same, because he is standing there in the middle with the ball nowhere near him. Actively chasing the ball from an offside position is very much different than just simply being on an offside position (maybe even on a 30 meter big offside). It's really not that hard to see, and I don't know how can you say that someone sprinting right beside you for the ball does not obstruct you. People need to realise the bar for interference is very high.  Like even the stupid goal United got against City (where Rashford was offside and running next to the ball) is considered technically correct by the letter of the law (even after the game and huge outcry because of course he's interfering even if it's not specifically matching the rules definition, Webb said it was technically correct but we'll look to referee such a scenario differently in future in the Prem) Long before he gets there?! Watch the video again: The pass starts about a few tenths of a second into the clip, De Ligt pivots during the 2 second mark and the header still happens during the 2 second mark. Apparently a few tenth of a second is ""long before"" now.  I don't know why you guys delude yourself, De Ligt clearly interfered with the play, so it would've been an offside. There's a reason why in situations like these, the players who are offside are usually walking at a snail's pace, often towards the opposite direction of the pass, so that no defender can claim that they were influenced. De Ligt does the exact opposite.  Raising the flag was still bullshit though, but once again: ~0,3 second is not *long before*, and having a ~1,5-2 second sprint with the defender is anything but not interfering with the play. Hahaha no! Mendy is heading the ball. It's not impossible for the defenders to catch up though.    Joselu was onside because he was behind the ball.    If Rudiger has had time to move ahead of Joselu to play the cross, the defenders have also had time to move ahead of Joselu. They couldn't defend it because one Bayern player didn't step up with the others played Rudiger onside and also stopped marking Joselu.   Your scenario is literally impossible.  Yeah I don't think that elbow to the head came from pushing someone you know  And no that was not a 50/50  Ramos got away with everything that match, even a card would have at least hidden the bias a bit Exactly.   It is not like they disallowed a goal as no one could predict the outcome of the play without the whistle. Even if it was a mistake it would be better if they owned it. >It's Mazraoui challenging for the ball while De Ligt stops his run and cuts into the middle. During the subsequent header to De Ligt the whistle is blown.  By that point the linier has already called it and Real players have stopped moving. But in anyway they both seem offside to me.  I do believe he ought to have let the play go on  and we will never know one way or the other but the only real reason De Light takes the ball is because Militao stops and he scores because Lunin doesn't even attempt to go for the ball. ""ticky tacky"" when 90% of the calls go in your favour continuously for 10 years (the time I saw the games live) there is clear intention and doesn't happen by chance. I remember maybe 2 games in the last 10 years when madrid got screwed by the refs and dozens of times when they were clearly favoured and many of those games were hilariously bad. Madrid's 2nd goal had almost no time to be called offside. And it was *not* offside.  Of course some goals have been disallowed because of an offside player ""passive"" interaction in the past, had him been between the goalkeeper and the shooter, or at the line of pass disturbing the defender like in this case (Rudiger has to mark two guys).  A ref made a viral tweet showing how it was actually a good call and all the controversy got exaggerated because let's be clear, some people including Tuchel, their players and many of their fans are treating it like a disallowed goal. It's too generous to even call it a chance when *it was* offside and when Madrid defenders stopped it after the whistle. It's about protocol and that's all they've got, it would have been called offside anyway.  People make these assumptions: - It was Mazraoui who marked the line (he wasn't, it was De Light) - It was a clear chance (it wasn't, Madrid backline stopped defending a couple seconds before De Light attempted the shot) - It was transcendental (it was not, it was a remote chance for an equalizer in which Bayern had subbed all their forwards) - Madrid's got favoured with the ref yesterday (they weren't, game should have ended by a couple minutes by then even according to the ref's added extra time over extra time) - Bayern got robbed anyway (wouldn't call to get robbed an isolated action which was not even legal, and people has not passed evidence on the contrary given these images) - It was a flagrant error (nothing related to protocol can have ""blatant"" as an adjective in front as it's, by definition, relative, including how close of a call that was)  People need to differentiate subjective aspects of the game (""play should have pursued"" according to how close the offside may have been, as there's no specific margin for it, if the linesman thinks he saw it he saw it, just as if the ref though some extra over extra seconds had to be added for all this to happen in first place) to objective ones (onside/offside). I have thus far refrained from engaging in this thread and others because I feel it's both futile as well as moot.  However, here, the difference of opinion seems to stem from the fact that you didn't notice Marciniak exclusively signal 2 added minutes at 99th minute.   I might agree with you that perhaps more time than that was warranted but the other commenter is basing his argument solely on that signal. Whether or not Marciniak should have added more, he decided to add only two and made the signal. But 90+11' came and went and the final whistle never came. He played an additional 4 minutes from there. You can check the veracity of this by watching the replay.  Again, the other commenter isn't debating how much time should have been added on. He is simply saying that Marciniak decided and signalled that he'll stretch the 9 minutes by another 2 but just kept on playing without another intimation or explanation.   A valid counter argument for you would be that it's his prerogative and he doesn't even need to intimate the teams to it. But what's also true is that this is extremely unconventional and seeing as played 4 minutes over 2 that he extended over 9, I'll even say it's unprecedented.  Now I'll leave the two of you to it again. I can't believe I have to explain again.  The guy said:  > Both Mazraouis' knee and Rüdiger's heel are beyond the line lol  I pointed out that Mazraouis' knee ISN'T beyond the line, De Ligt's knee is. The picture clearly shows Mazraouis' knee BEHIND the line.  Explain how I am the confused one here. Are you sure you're not the confused one? Those 30 mins includes any time played after the 45 mins, so if they played 5 out of the 14/15 minutes added there should be 11+ minutes of added time. Point being either too little was added in normal time or too much was added later. Which might suggest Bayerns time wasting was effective whilst Real Madrids was punished. Yeah, screw the phrasing. If you watch even a tiny bit of football you know that no ref would give an offside there because of de ligt. They provide more guidance and examples at the end of the laws. Importantly, the phrase is ""clearly impacts on the **ability** of an opponent to play the ball."" De Ligt never actually prevents Rudiger from doing anything. https://cazn.me/m/d36f4a  I dont see where is de Ligt is interfering with Rudiger. There is probably a meter between the players You're getting all up in arms over your horrible misunderstanding of the offside rule and what constitutes a challenge.   You're also conveniently leaving out the first part:  >**preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball** by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or challenging an opponent for the ball  Rudiger was never prevented from being able to play the ball. Your argument is that De Ligt's run influences Rudiger's decision-making, but that's not actual prevention. Rudiger could easily have decided to ignore De Ligt and pursue Mazraoui (despite the fact that he still wouldn't have been able to reach it in time).   Your best argument is:  >clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent  At least then, you could make the decision-making argument. You would just need to convince people that the ball was close before De Ligt pulled out of his run (which I also would disagree with). [deleted] If Mazraoui is challenging for the ball, he needs to be onside. 100%, not saying anything just makes it so much worse. Also, I think I found the comment that has the Porto Shakhtar ref decision [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/aNCVubn1Qk). This is what should have happened, but the main ref messed it up royally I would cope that way as well... Maybe they have just been a great team with great players and great managers over the last 10 years. It's almost as if they're the biggest club in the world?  Edit: Saying ""ticky-tacky"" was lazy on my end. Some of the examples you gave are valid but there are always breaks one way or another. However, most of your examples are fully opinion based, like the Vasques one with PSG, or the Benzema on Donnarumma (which PSG fans didn't even complain about because it wasn't a push), or all this talk about not getting yellows, etc. Nacho hands on Kimmich? Give me break bro... Nacho braces for a crash and Kimmich is 6"" shorter than him and then takes a dive.   Why would Madrid get any favoritism if it has been actively beefing with UEFA for the longest time? So you're saying it would've been disallowed 100% because De Ligt wasn't passive enough for your taste. That's your assumption.  I assume that it wouldn't have been disallowed because his interference in this specific scene is minimal.     In the end it's a standing order by the UEFA to let marginal situations play out, which the refs didn't. He made a mistake and he apologized. Still it's hugely frustrating for Bayern to not get this one good opportunity because the linesman (who apologized as well) marked the play offside way, way, waaaaayyyyy too early. [deleted] >Explain how I am the confused one here.   You seem under the impression that people are confusing Mazraouis knee with that of De Ligt. Nobody is even in the least confused about it. The fact that you keep bringing up an entirely unrelated knee, is what makes you look confused.  I don't get what's so hard about this. Yes, De Ligts knee is past the line, but no, nobody cares.  >The picture clearly shows Mazraouis' knee BEHIND the line.  You might be looking at the wrong picture. The picture I'm looking at shows both Rudigers foot and Mazraouis knee slightly past the line. Because they both seem past the line, you can fight about him being offside or not, but it's not behind the line as drawn on the picture. https://imgur.com/a/ej2vyoB  Ball is in the air, Rüdiger sees it just like he sees the two Bayern players. If De Ligt is not interfering with the play, then that means Rüdiger knows 100% that De Ligt is actually offside, thus he can completely ignore him. You can't seriously say that Rüdiger was supposed to know that De Ligt was making a run for the ball out of jest, when it is the exact opposite of what players are supposed to do when they are offside.  The proper behaviour in instances like this is to make it 1000000000000% clear for the opposition that you are not challenging the ball at all - like Joselu standing like a dick in the middle of the box, while the ball was on the side. Walk at a snail's pace and/or move into any direction but the one where the ball is. What does De Ligt do? Makes a run for the ball before pivoting. Was he interfering? Yes. Was the play offside then? Absolutely.  Now, could a bad VAR review still award a goal if it was to happen at the end of the play without a whistle - assuming the other Bayern player was indeed on? Possibly, but *""if the referee was shit, then he could've ignored De Ligt's plain interference and allow the goal""* is not exactly a solid ground to be on. Why are you citing the rule which I don't even argue on behalf of? The rule I am referring to from the very beginning this:  > **clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent**  You don't need much convincing here, because De Ligt was literally making a run for the ball. That is the exact opposite thing to do for someone in his position.  Imagine it as a trial, where De Ligt has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was clearly not attempting to play the ball. He'd get axed by most juries, that's why players avoid moving towards the ball in these situations like the plague, often moving in the opposite direction instead, or if they do, they just walk at best. It's a bit similar to the other rookie offside mistake players do, when they obstruct the keeper before a rocket of a goal which the keeper would've had 0% chance to save anyway, but because the opposition player prevented sight and/or movement of the keeper to at least attempt it, it's an offside. The referees won't do physics calculations to see if it was literally 100% for said keeper to not save it, just as they wouldn't do the same with Rüdiger; De Ligt clearly interfered and impacted his decision making in a rather close call. Yup , no ref calls offside because of de ligt there. If you watch football , you know this . Probably just madrid apologists talking about this. You can't judge the ball's end-position by just taking a single glance at the ball in the air. They were both clearly sprinting for it, at least De Light did, Rüdiger may have been just covering him, and then you can see the moment when De Ligt sees that either he can't reach it, a teammate of his got it, or both. If you go frame by frame you can see the pivot once he reaches the edge of the box, but up until then he was chasing the ball.  De Ligt would've been easily called offside there most of the time, no questions about it. Not doing so would create an awful precedent, where you can just dummy the opposition from an offside position as long as you pivot a few tenths of a second before the ball reaches someone else. If he was going towards different position compared to the ball's route from the very beginning, then this case would actually be difficult, because it's hard to say that someone who never even ran towards the ball was somehow interfering with its play. But he did, so it's a moot point. If they were really the best team during that 2014-2018 era wouldn't they win the league more than once in that period? Best teams win the league titles as well. Tell a me the last game when they weren't favored by the ref in UCL. Last one i remember is also in 2017 1st leg when bayern got a penalty from hitting madrid player's chest (was it carvajal?) but even that penalty Vidal missed. Maybe they are the biggest team with most titles because the UCL competition was literally created around them and in the first years (60s 5peat) they got to handpick their opponents and in La Liga dictator Franco cut the path from all the other teams and threatened their players. Do you recall one of the greatest players of all time Di Stefano being stolen from Barça to Madrid? This is what all the other teams have had to deal with all these years. And it makes sense because real madrid is the royal team of the Spanish capital city and most of the authorities and the Spanish King are backing them. You can't deny that. Well it would have been better if you read it. The amount of added time is not the issue here. I already said I might agree with you on that front.   As far as whinging goes, all I know is that I'm certainly not the one whinging. I'm in fact decrying it. Again, would have better if you read the text before passing judgment on it and passing it off as useless.  Anyway, I added the factual information in the debate that was missing but I don't want to be a party to it because as I said it's moot but more importantly, futile, especially as far as a consensus is concerned. Circle Mazraouis' knee. Are you maybe confusing De Ligt's foot as Mazraouis' knee? > like Joselu standing like a dick in the middle of the box  Do you think a player standing in the middle of the box has no impact on the keeper / other defenders ? I am sure De Ligt is in Rudiger's mind - I am not contesting that - to me, he is not blocking Rudiger to do anything.  As I said, for me it is really not an obvious offside so I think let it play would have been the right decision. VAR would have either agree or disagree with me. I dont know. >Why are you citing the rule which I don't even argue on behalf of? The rule I am referring to from the very beginning this:   **clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent**  [Why are you lying?](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1cnsz16/comment/l3a28j7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  >Imagine it as a trial, where De Ligt has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was clearly not attempting to play the ball.  So, the literal opposite of how burden of proof works in many countries? Great start!  >that's why players avoid moving towards the ball in these situations like the plague, often moving in the opposite direction instead, or if they do, they just walk at best.  That's usually when a player is walking back onside and the ball is played close to them. If the ball is not close to them, they are free to make runs, provided they are not the only one who could receive the ball.  >It's a bit similar to the other rookie offside mistake players do, when they obstruct the keeper before a rocket of a goal which the keeper would've had 0% chance to save anyway, but because the opposition player prevented sight and/or movement of the keeper to at least attempt it, it's an offside.  Which is covered in another criterion for what constitutes an offside offense. This is not relevant to the situation at hand.  Overall, I'm sensing that you're arguing largely based on your playing experience and how you **feel** the laws should be. But that's not how it works. I'd advise you to actually read the Laws of the Game (including the guidance and examples at the end) before making such confidently incorrect arguments. [deleted] Okay so going by that logic any team that wins the Champions league and doesn't win their league is favored by refs? Kinda like Bayern this year? (obviously not the case). Looking through your comment history it seems like you're just a sour Barca fan. Why don't we just agree to disagree and leave it at that. Okay, you see the pale leg that's sticking very clearly across the line? The one that clearly belongs to De Ligt in a way that's not even remotely confusing? Follow that down to De Ligt's foot that's also clearly across the line. Then very close by, there's a small dark spot. That's Mazraoui's knee, and it seems just barely across the line. As the line is 2D, if the knee weren't across it, it would be entirely obscured.  It's okay. You didn't pay attention to the picture, and thought everybody else was confused, while really you just missed something subtle. That can happen to the best of us. Just for next time, first ask these kind of questions before doubling down on the idea everybody else missed something obvious. It's way less embarrassing that way. As long as Joselu is not obstructing the keeper's sight (standing in front of him) or movement (standing in a way where he can't reach a ball which has already been shot/crossed), he doesn't impact direct play with the ball. Yes, in the literal sense every single thing impacts the keeper, even if there are 8 people in an offside position around him, because what if the keeper gets a backpass from 30 meters, he accidentally has a bad first touch, then boom, suddenly 8 players are eligible to take a shot, so he has to think about this possibility. I say that directly running towards the ball with your defender has much more impact on the direct play, than Joselu standing there flaccidly.  Now, if he was offside during the moment of a cross, and a teammate of his scored a goal on the far side, then it would be offside. Even if he was standing still, the keeper who has 0,5 a second to decide which player to cover the cross from can not know it, thus he would interfere. But he was onside for the cross. > Why are you lying?  My bad, I meshed the last part together with the next quote and quoted the less impactful one.  > So, the literal opposite of how burden of proof works in many countries? Great start!  Okay, you are the defender of De Ligt, who literally made a run for the ball. Go ahead, convince the jury that he was just disoriented or something!  > If the ball is not close to them, they are free to make runs  Sure, if said run does not imply challenging the ball in any way, shape or form. That's why you say people walking and raising their hands around the ball, when they know that they are offside, while some many many meters away from the ball can freely run around, even if they are offside.  > before making such confidently incorrect arguments.  It's not incorrect, because De Ligt is clearly interfering. If you have troubles understanding that someone making a run for a ball is quite literally interfering with the game, then my advice is to keep engaging some more with the beautiful game, and you'll get used to these rules. Free kicks and corners are always special cases. You'd get penalties most of the time for doing the same things in the box during an open play, so it's not a good comparison.  And how was De Ligt clearly not reaching it? The guy standing half a meter from the teammate that eventually reached it was clearly not reaching it, and Rüdiger had a whopping ~2 seconds to calculate all of this? No, that's just not how it works.   There's a reason you don't see this shit (outside your free kick/corner kick examples), instead you see players freezing, walking or raising both of their hands, so that they can clearly imply that they have ZERO intention to interfere with the ball. Trying to argue that an opposition player who walked AWAY from a ball with raised up hands was somehow interfering would be ridiculous. But arguing that De Ligt making a run for it in a play which possibly did not even last for 2 whole seconds is very far from that scenario. That's a shadow of his knee. Look upwards and you can see Rudiger's right-side body doing the same. It's not 100% opaque.  https://i.imgur.com/NTwXHeZ.png  It's okay. You didn't pay attention to the picture, and thought everybody else was confused, while really you just missed something subtle. That can happen to the best of us. >My bad, I meshed the last part together with the next quote and quoted the less impactful one.  [You're still arguing that he challenged for the ball.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1cnsz16/comment/l3aqec5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) And again, you're wrong about what constitutes a challenge.  Also, you responding to ""Same offside laws apply to free kicks"" by saying ""On paper? Yes. Actually? Not at all."" is factually incorrect and an admission that you're not actually basing your arguments on the laws. You're just saying that we should trust your feelings of how referees should call the game instead of the actual text in the Laws of the Game.   >Go ahead, convince the jury that he was just disoriented or something!  You're missing the point. I'm pointing out that your analogy starts with an incorrect understanding of how burden of proof works (in the US and UK at least).  Regardless, this isn't a court of law, and there is no jury. If anything from your analogy is applicable, the referee is the judge. However, they are bound by the laws and provided interpretations from FIFA and IFAB. What we're all arguing is that the laws governing what constitutes an offside offense don't permit the referee to rule De Ligt offside. The only possible justification would be if the referee deemed the ball to be ""close"" when De Ligt pulled out of his run, which you haven't made a compelling argument for.  >Sure, if said run does not imply challenging the ball in any way, shape or form.  Again, you're referencing the ""**preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball** by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision or challenging an opponent for the ball"" criteria but completely ignoring the first part that I've highlighted. Even if you're correct that De Ligt is challenging for the ball, he at no point prevents Rudiger from being able to play the ball. Please address this point or stop making this half-assed argument.  >It's not incorrect, because De Ligt is clearly interfering.  You keep asserting this but fail to back it up with factual arguments.  >then my advice is to keep engaging some more with the beautiful game, and you'll get used to these rules.  This is basically an admission that you've never read the Laws of the Game. I have. I've played my entire life and refereed for 10 years. And considering that I haven't heard any commentators or referees make this argument, I'm going to trust my reading of the actual text of the laws instead of your unsupported feelings of how you think things should be. [deleted] So... did you see that knee the whole time, and just figured the more likely confusion was with De Ligts knee?  I mean, the safest answer is always to go with the truth, but if you care what other people think (and the complaining about downvotes suggests you do), maybe take a moment to consider which answer makes you look worse before you start lying here. You're forgetting to account for the intent of the pass.  Nacho's pass to Rudiger while Joselu was offside before Madrid's second goal was very obviously not intended for Joselu because he was on the opposite side of the box. There's no argument for ""hey maybe that pass was meant for Joselu"" at all. That's why his calmly walking back uninvolved isn't an offside offense.  The long pass to Mazraoui wasn't intended specifically for Mazraoui...that long pass went to both Mazraoui and De Ligt. They started their runs right next to each other. De Ligt saw he wasn't going to reach it so he pivots. But he started from an offside position and stayed involved in the attack. He still influenced/affected the play. It's not just about blatantly obstructing anyone.  Blowing the whistle was still a terrible call, but De Ligt should've been called offside in that build-up upon review anyway (assuming Bayern even scores if the Madrid defense doesn't stop playing). Some of the most atrocious calls are done by referees who had refereed for more than 10 years, and at the highest level. The reason commentators don't talk about it, because the single most obnoxious thing about that decision was raising the flag early. It would've been an offside anyway, because based on the rules, De Ligt was interfering, but not leaving it to VAR was just criminal. > Same offside laws apply to free kicks.   On paper? Yes. Actually? Not at all.  > Does he challenge an opponent for the ball? No.  Yes, before he pivots. Does he attempt to run for the ball? Also yes. There you go, two reasons too many already why it was a clear offside.  Yes, if he was 10 meters behind, then running towards the ball would not have been an offence (even if he was somehow still starting from an offside position), but don't kid yourself that it's the same as starting from half a meter from the guy who actually reached the ball.  > If you want an example where a player does even more than De Ligt did here, watch the goal Nuñez scored against Arsenal in Oct. 2022. The reasons he wasn’t called offside are broken down here.  Let me get this straight: the player in my first picture (Nunez) does even more than De Ligt on the second picture? https://imgur.com/a/cHCgIds  How? De Ligt starts his run from almost the same place from the teammate of his who eventually gets the ball and they are both running towards the ball for a while, while Nunez was sticking his sprint to the sideline as the lobbed ball was going towards an invisible line extension from the edge of the box. Did you respond to the wrong person? I haven't talked about Joselu's goal at all.  Nevertheless...  >The long pass to Mazraoui wasn't intended specifically for Mazraoui...that long pass went to both Mazraoui and De Ligt.  The passer's intent really doesn't have any bearing on anything. Intent really only matters when considering if a defender deliberate played a ball or if it deflected off of them. That's why an unintentional deflection off an attacking player to their offside teammate is still offside.  >But he started from an offside position and stayed involved in the attack.  This isn't an offense.  >He still influenced/affected the play. It's not just about blatantly obstructing anyone.  Like I said to the other guy, cite the relevant criteria for offside. ""Influencing/affecting play"" is a vague argument.  Playing devil's advocate, the best argument I can come up with is based on this criteria:  >clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent  That requires the referee to judge that:  * the ball was close, * De Ligt's movement was a clear attempt to play the ball, and * De Ligt's movement impacted on an opponent  I could possibly see the argument that De Ligt's movement impacted on Rudiger (though I'm not entirely sure what definition of ""impact on"" they're using). But in my view, De Ligt pulls out of his run before the ball is actually close to him. And more importantly, De Ligt never actually attempts to play the ball, according to the definition of play in the glossary:  >Play   Action by a player which makes contact with the ball  So even this criteria doesn't really fit.  >(assuming Bayern even scores if the Madrid defense doesn't stop playing)  I do agree that the play probably would've ended differently had the whistle not been blown. Okay, if you're just going to keep repeating yourself, then there's no point in continuing. You refuse to rebut any of my points where I cite the actual criteria for an offside offense. I'm not even sure you know which criteria you're trying to use in your argument. You've proven yourself multiple times to be ignorant of the laws, and what's more is you seem hellbent on just relying on your feelings while expecting everyone else to just trust you. The sad thing is you could very easily go read the [Laws of the Game](https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2023-24?l=en) and educate yourself. You can lead a horse to water, I guess... [deleted] >I haven't talked about Joselu's goal at all  I know, but the discussion mentioned players slowly walking backwards to show they were deliberately staying out of the action to avoid the offside call, which is what Joselu did until he was back onside before Rudiger's cross.  >De Ligt never actually attempts to play the ball  I believe he does because, when the long pass is sent, both De Ligt and Mazraoui are making their runs and tracking that ball. That is an attempt to play the ball, even if he pulled out after realizing Mazraoui was behind him with a better shot at it. And he stayed involved in the play (which isn't an offense in and of itself, but can certainly be when the action happens close by).  We've seen players realize they're offside and stop their run right away, which is fine. No offense called, no problem. But starting close to the play, changing direction slightly while still running forward, forcing the defense to mark him differently...that is still an offside. All my years playing, that's affecting/impacting the play. If De Ligt had been on the other wing, I would definitely say his positioning wasn't relevant regardless of involvement. But he was right there in the disputed area.  And a few touches later, he fires into the net.  So I think the review would've looked at his movements during that entire build-up. Then again, maybe that's putting too much faith in these refs as well... It's not a feeling, it's obviously supported by the same laws you've also provided. You not understanding them, even after refereeing, just goes to show that even when we - rightfully so - complain about the top referees, it's not better down the line. Then again, if you've been interpreting it wrong for 10 years now, why stop now? Ah, that one. Yes, that may be egregious (except Nunez doesn't run directly to the ball, ""just"" beside it) and it's crazy that they did not award an offside for that. It's extremely cynical to say that Nunez is not interfering with the play there. *""Gabriel makes a failed attempt to clear the ball, but he's not being put under pressure by Nunez""* - so having an offside player sprinting right beside you is not being put on pressure... and keep in mind, it's not on Gabriel or Rüdiger to judge if someone is offside or not. They play until the whistle, so if they see an opponent having a race with them towards a ball, we can't just say that they should've known that were offside by a centimeter.  Attempt to run for the ball in such a close situation like Nunez's or Ligt's is absolutely offside. Again, it's just cynical to conclude that running towards (or in case of Nunez, almost beside) the ball is not a challenge for the ball. You are either far away from the ball so you can do whatever you want, or you are near the ball or its trajectory, and then your movements clearly has to indicate that you make ZERO attempt to get that ball. No, starting an almost identical run with the teammate who eventually reaches said ball is just simply not zero, and we can't exclude the possibility that if Rüdiger knew that he was offside, he wouldn't have went for some other player instead. >I know, but the discussion mentioned players slowly walking backwards to show they were deliberately staying out of the action to avoid the offside call, which is what Joselu did until he was back onside before Rudiger's cross.  Fair enough. I didn't see anything wrong with Joselu's goal.  Regarding the De Ligt goal, just to be clear, the criterion I'm highlighting is:  >  If you're referring to one of the other criteria, please cite it.  >both De Ligt and Mazraoui are making their runs and tracking that ball. That is an attempt to play the ball, even if he pulled out after realizing Mazraoui was behind him with a better shot at it  It's pedantic, but according to the definition of ""play"" in the Laws of the Game (""Action by a player which makes contact with the ball""), I find it hard to say that De Ligt makes an attempt to play the ball. He never jumps nor extends for the ball. Merely running after the ball is not an actual ""attempt to make contact with the ball.""  This is kind of stated in this clarification given in the laws:  >a player in an offside position is moving towards the ball with the intention of playing the ball and is fouled before playing or attempting to play the ball, or challenging an opponent for the ball, the foul is penalised as it has occurred before the offside offence  It's obviously not the same situation, but the point of this example is that merely ""moving towards the ball with the intention of playing the ball"" is not considered an attempt to play the ball. If it were, then technically the offside offense would've occurred before the foul, and the foul would not be given. This is in contrast to the following clarification they give:  >an offence is committed against a player in an offside position who is already playing or attempting to play the ball, or challenging an opponent for the ball, the offside offence is penalised as it has occurred before the foul challenge  Regarding the closeness of the ball:  >But starting close to the play, changing direction slightly while still running forward, forcing the defense to mark him differently...that is still an offside.  You mention starting close to the play. (I'm assuming you're referring to when the pass was made.) However, the ball is 30 yards away at that point, which is not ""close."" A key part of that offside criterion is that the ball must be close when evaluating whether or not an attacker's action impacts on the defender. What is considered ""close"" is obviously subjective, but the ball is still in the air 5-10 yards away when De Ligt pulls out of his run.   >All my years playing, that's affecting/impacting the play.  I think this is the crux of the problem for a lot of people. They've changed the offside rules over the years. I remember that at some point in the past, merely making a run at a ball from an offside position was considered to be offside. Then they changed it to a strict ""a player must touch the ball before flagging and whistling them offside"" (which led to a bunch of annoying long balls where everyone knew it was offside, but the assistant had to run 40 yards with the attacker to finally signal it). After some time, they settled on this set of criteria with one caveat (in the offside diagrams at the end of the book):  >A player in an offside position (A) may be penalised before playing or touching the ball, if, in the opinion of the referee, no other team-mate in an onside position has the opportunity to play the ball You can't even decide on which criteria you're arguing for! If you don't even know your own argument, why should anyone else buy it?  But go ahead. Get all your impotent whining out of your system. Maybe someone will actually listen to your incoherent ramblings someday lol [deleted] I get your point, too. Well said, by the way.  At the end of the day, by blowing the whistle too early, the refs denied us all the chance to hear an explanation had Bayern still scored from that possession. I made a misquote, which was one line above the one I meant to copy. I am sorry that realizing that you've been refereeing without understanding the rule hurt you so much. Don't worry, it's not much of a hinderance in terms of career-advancement for a ref! Good luck, and let's hope you can better yourself in your craft! No, this is what the offside is. Both of them are clearly interfering with the play and should be labeled as offsides. If you want to base your argument on ""but it wasn't called by this premier league ref"", then we may as well burn the rulebook. Agreed >I made a misquote, which was one line above the one I meant to copy.  I really think the problem is that you're just not very detail-oriented. Perhaps I'm wrong, but this admission of yours is but one example of that.  You keep saying it was a misquote, but then you continue talking about challenges. And then you go on weird tangents, making incorrect analogies to a trial court, as if any of that is applicable to the game or even supports your case.  Also, I'm not a referee anymore and have no desire to be one in the future. My career in software engineering is much more lucrative and fulfilling. Good try on the condescension though lol.  I was saying that I refereed in the past in response to your generous advice based on your years of experience watching others do what you can't. The point was that you're commenting on things that are beyond your comprehension, partly because of your lack of experience and partly because you refuse to educate yourself by actually reading the Laws. Seriously, it should be embarrassing to so confidently hold an opinion regarding a job you've never done, involving a ruleset you've never read.  Honest question: why won't you read the Laws of the Game? I really think if you let go of your preconceived notions and actually read Law 11, the glossary, and the example diagrams at the end, it would resolve a lot of your misunderstandings. [deleted] I'm just being a dick; someone else already showed some convincing quotes some time around last night, which convinced me. No, it's not me interpreting it, it's literally what it means. Running towards the ball when you have the chance to reach it is interfering with play. Just think about it: two players start running straight towards the direction of the ball from almost identical positions, one reaches it, the other pivots earlier. Somehow you claim that one was not attempting to interfere with it, while the other one was literally fighting for it. So how should the defender know this exactly, without having the knowledge of hindsight? Don't be ridiculous. If you start running STRAIGHT towards the direction to a ball which you'd have the chance to reach it, then you are interfering.  It's not even understanding football, it's just common sense and reading comprehension. You can put all your eggs in the ""but the dogshit var in the prem allowed it once"" basket, but I'm not sure why you'd do it. The moment that someone with a knife starts running towards you, then long before you'll know whether they will take a turn midway or not, you will feel directly threatened by that person, and very quickly rethink your stance about the implication of someone running towards the ball.  At this point I'd just like to know what you'd call that. Did De Light see someone in the stand and wanted to give them an autogram? Was he just attempting a non-attempt? Was he just trying to help Rüdiger accelerate the same way cyclists help eachother out with the pace? I'm sure there are many Monty Python-worthy potential sketches in this one, but the reality is that he directly involved himself with the play for the ball. That is forbidden by the rules black and white. [deleted] All right, I'm convinced."
"Matthijs de Ligt: “The linesman told me: sorry, I made a mistake”.  “It’s been a shame”,","2024-05-08T21:42:42+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1cng9zv/matthijs_de_ligt_the_linesman_told_me_sorry_i/","[No textual content]","5725","SpiritedSuccess5675","https://v.redd.it/7mwljfarv9zc1","**Mirrors / Alternative Angles**     *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* What a shitty situation to be in. The whole reason VAR was introduced was to prevent situations like this, yet here we are Must be difficult on a personal note for de Ligt too. 5 years since the Spurs match and another gut-wrenching way to get knocked out today And this is why you don't raise the flag before the play is done. Ridiculously shite by the ref and linesman.   In an age of VAR it's not acceptable I would be so pissed if we weren't already bottling it ourselves *I buy nothing for that*  Hhahahaha that's a Dutch translation. Very strange one to throw out there I feel so bad for MdL, this is his second CL semifinal and the second time he experiences absolute heartbreak. This is getting spicy Should have gone to VAR.  Now we will have so many posts with ms paint lines for it with heavy baisness.  The thing that saved face a little is how tight it is It was mistake but i am still not sure if it was on or off. Real players backed off a little and that would be the difference between contesting the shot. So many ifs. Real were better today and derserved to go through. Let’s be honest here: Real deserved to win. But this situation kind of makes the tie look bad and this is all we’re going to talk about for the next decade A brilliant game overshadowed by 1 major mistake. Such a shame De Ligt definitely looks off but it's Müller who gets the ball and he's slightly behind De Ligt. Impossible to say if he's on or not but that decision from the linesmen should not be happening in a UCL Semi at 90+12'. I mean you have semi automated offsides now, why in the world would you want to blow the whistle that early Sometimes I feel the linesman are now basically like the people who pressed the buttons in elevators in the 1920s. They are basically obsolete with VAR.  In terms of offside calling.   Why the fuck would they need to raise the flag if the play has to go on till the end? Why don’t they strip them from the flags and become just basically an assistant referee WITHOUT the duties of calling offside. As someone that refereed for 17 years, I am gutted for the lino and I know how he is feeling. It hurt me on the inside once I saw the replay. I've done the same thing myself. Gotta shake it off and life goes on. But damn it is so hard to shake off horror decisions like that one. This is such an advocate for the automated offsides. If the technology is there what’s the point in relying on the linesman for offsides? All good lads, he's apologised, can forget about it now. Why would the ref even think of whistling when the call is this close. This makes no sense at all. I have seen them let play go on for clear offsides just for the sake of it. This is beyond stupid. What an absolute disgrace. In a world of VAR, you have to let it play out. Shocking decision especially when we saw what happened with the Joselu goal Militão and Lunin stopped playing completely with the whistle, Rudiger also changed his approach. Its impossible to know if he would score, but I highly doubt it. Hats off for doing the interview in that manner, could have easily lost the plot there Bayern feel they got robbed. Madrid comeback is tainted because of that last decision. What a tragic situation. Considering how good the refereeing had been, such a stupid way to throw it all away. I saw the freeze frames. I am not sure either way that the Munich players were on side or off. It was very close but this is definitely on the assistant ref for raising the flag too early and then of course the center ref sees it and blows his whistle right away. ""I buy nothing for that"" lekker ge-englished Matthijs Eh. Even with everything playing out ideally, it‘s still just a 2-2 with extra 30 minutes of playing without any capability to sustain attack, after two disastrous goals gifted away. Bitter outcome, yeah, but deserved result Why they let Reals 2-1 finish, then whistle and VAR check, but immediately whistle for the same situation on the other side? Head ref also to blame a bit. He didn’t have to blow his whistle and could have let the play go on Let play continue, then raise the flag and let var handle it. He is seething. Take flags away from linemen. Let it be all video refereeing for offside decisions. Unnaceptable. It doesn't matter which team was better etc, it's about having a fair assement of the game. And here we see yet another big mistake influencing a match. Referees as a whole really have to step it up. The Premier League alone has been riddled with mistakes and controversy this entire season, and now this in the semi final of the biggest club tournament in the world. Absolutely horrendous officiating. I’m glad that there’s one less error prone ref and linesman uefa will overlook in the final. German teams get fucked by refs and Dortmund is at the top of the pile. When we don’t get fucked this is how far we get. Looked offside - but too tight to blow the whistle and stop play Was it, or was it not, offside?  Do we know? Replay of thirty minutes to decide who goes through.  Do it UEFA. I've been looking at it on the basis of De Ligt being offside, but he does not technically interfere in the first play. If you're looking at the Bayern player who actually challenges for the header, he looks well onside. typical barca paying off refs The linesman apologizing is very cool behavior. He must feel so bad. Own your mistake learn from it. I hope he can move on. Had this happened against Real Madrid, Papa Perez would again declare a new Super Champions league where only Real Madrid plays. The sad thing is, Madrid scored the 2nd goal BECAUSE exactly of this rule... WRONG offside decision BUT they let the play go on and it could be checked by VAR....  Unbelievable. it was just a honest mistake.   It's weird how RM always get those in their favor tho. The linesman and referee shouldn't officiate a CL game again, such is the standard. Does anyone still believes these ""unlucky mistakes"" that keep benefit real Madrid keep happening by chance? This shit happens to soo many smaller clubs been calling it for ages and talking to brick wall it’s how the refs play on long as possible for certain clubs and lesser clubs blow immediately linesman should have his betting accounts checked Clear error from the linesman. I can see that de Ligt is angry, rightfully so and yes, that was an egregious mistake. Therefore I like how the linesman apologized directly to de Ligt and owned up to it. It is what it is. Im yet to see Real lose a crucial game due to a refereeing error lmao I don’t get this controversy. Yes, of course the linesman shouldn’t have lifted the flag so early but it was offside. Also, De Ligt’s shot came well after the referee blew the whistle. So in the end, an offside was judged correctly and play was stopped. The goalkeeper stopped, the offensive player chose to shoot and it went in but all that was well after the referee blew the whistle, which stops the game. [deleted] Easy to say it was a mistake. Hilarious. Bullshit every time it happens with Real. Same old story. Really really bad mistake, but good on the ref for at least admitting it. I got a feeling he'll be extra cautious in the future, not that that will comfort Bayern tonight this was a final for sure I'm hopeful about the future. As offside technology advances, the role of linesmen will undoubtedly evolve. Enhanced offside technology will likely lessen the need for them to adjudicate offside calls, shifting their focus towards making calls on other fouls that the main match official might miss. Growing pains. Anthony Taylor somehow not being involved is the bigger surprise kids mistake I don't know how a ref that officiated a world cup final could pull off Anthony Tailor shit Nothing new Video Assistant for Real Unbelievable error which again is in Real's favor. Not for the first time, and probably not the last. I don't even want to watch the final cause of this yes blame the whole season on this linesman! cmon this is pathetic let's just ban refs so we can all just have fun together and play this beautiful game without them...oh wait Bring robot referees already!! Oh really? I'll take your word for it Bayern time wasted when it favored them, than score changed and extra time helped Bayern again and they got extra 4 min again.   Extra time never should support the time wasting team (in the first place). We are talking about a 13-14th min of extra time which should have never happened. And that's how Madrid got 14 champions. Without that whistle, players would’ve kept going no guarantee that he even got that shot off. So it’s all hypothetical at this point. And ref added more time just to even made it to that point. I have no idea how not a single person is talking how in the hell this match kept on till min 114!   The game was resumed on 91:45 after real goal var check, 9mins of added time means it should have ended at 111 or 112 at most. What a GIANT fuckup by the referees. From the head ref whistling to the linesman raising his flag unnecessarily quick. Now, the obvious thing is that Bayern were second best on the night. A single goal is not enough to withstand the might of Real Madrid. But man that one call looms over the match for the rest of time. The time when the refs fucked up a major call in a UCL Semi-Final and then apologized for it madrid stopped playing w/ the whistle The rule that VAR can't overturn an on-field mistake is just counterproductive to the benefits of VAR. They just need to look at Rugby, whom have it nearly perfectly implemented.  I swear they leave it in this etheric powerless state just for the headline controversies at this point as over 5 years is plenty enough time to get this right. And then everyone clapped. Oh man. It was the ref that didn't have to stop the play, the lines man has to rise the flag if the think there is an outside cause if there is and he doesn't call it, it cannot be challenge, it was the ref that fuck up. After seeing ArchivoVAR on twitter, Mazraoui seems to have been on side, so it's a huge blunder.. really disappointed that us spectators were robbed by that terrible call. would have gone to extra time and who knows. bayern could have played for penalties. like neuer, the ref did everything right, except one last thing.   We need Super VAR even if the lines man made a mistake where is var? I just hope the final isn't ruined by such amateurish referee mistakes. It’s an absolutely shambolic call. Really have to feel Bayern here. Hope the ref and lineman‘s careers end now. Can't tell me that ref didn't have money on Madrid smart play from perez there Just one thing :- how many champions leagues did Madrid really win by playing legit football? Full Apology:  Sorry, I made a mistake...if I had let play go on VAR would have ruled it offside instead for the same fuckin reason. It is what it is. Linesman saw Bayern could score the 2-2 and raised his arm at lightspeed. It was not the first time, and it surely won't be the last. Why people believing him lol Sure he did mate They got 15 mins added time bcz of the ref The ball came from Mendy. So definitely not offside. Does De Ligt interfer? I hope he was waiting for the ref in the parking lot like Mourinho If it happened on 1-1, I would be furious. But by 2-1, I had already accepted defeat. Honestly, takes balls to straight up apologize.  🙈🙉🙊 Wanhhhh Vini no red card for a choke vs Leipzig, 2 deflections vs City, Neuer gift and now this. Madrid black magic isn't even funny anyone, it's just gross. I don’t know why everyone just assumed that Bayern would have scored for sure if the referee had not blown the whistle. The xG from that position is 0.5 at most and therefore on average, Real would still win the game. Yes it’s a mistake, but the likelihood of that decision would have changed the outcome is really low. Referee fuck ups always seem to favor Madrid 🤔  Why are Bayern players like this? “I got paid by Real Madrid to blow the whistle for no reason whatsoever. Sorry. It’s been a shame.” Are we surprised, refs always get a boner for Madrid, they're a Mafia over European football. Question on this: are there rules against giving the goal for bayern in this case postgame or is it so unprecedented refs never do it? [removed] Every UEFA ref needs to be put through some referee bootcamp or something in the preseason. Drill in to them the fucking rules that they came up with so they stop making so many mistakes, and then the technology might start magically working in our favour No goddamn accountability from the match officials. Funny how everyone else in literally every other profession on the planet is penalised for a blatant error, but these guys just apologise and act like that's it. Linos are not necessary anymore. What even the point? All I can say is, FUCK Real Madrid! The ref bias towards them is unmatched. Countless games and even trophies are gifted to them every year. It’s getting to new levels of fucking rediculous. Saying ""sorry"" doesn't cut it in big games like this wtf... Rigged It would only be controversial if it would turned out to not be an offside.  Clearly it was so whats the big deal? Paid hoes Bunch of Bayern fans here saying that they deserved to lose. Man, what a bunch of f**king losers. [deleted] Why do people care. It was clearly off. Didn't even need var to see it Every single ref across the top 5 leagues, European, and FIFA organizations need to be fired. The last 3/4 years have had unbelievable and pathetic refereeing. Every season one of the main talking points is about VAR and the horrendous decisions refs made in that season. I think enough is enough. Not even a Bayern fan but come on this is just stupid now. There is 0 consistency across the sport in terms of refereeing right now Bro has been trash since he left Ajax cry some more Lying shit bag. His grandpa also didn’t know what what was happening to his neighbors either oh my why they all gone oh well Probably wanted to end the game already because they were in the 113 minute after they had given 9 minutes OT. Ref put two fingers up when they were at 110 so people were confused if 99+2 or 110/111+2 Reporter: You must be proud of your squad.   De Ligt: We are Bayern Munich. We are Bayern Munich and we didn't win anything.   Yikes. Although it won't comfort any Bayern fans tonight, a referee has to be entitled to make errors and be forgiven if he recognises them. This constant abuse of referees for every error is the reason why the refereeing level is poor overall. It is the reason why most talented refs quit early because they just can't be arsed to deal with the abuse  World class players make errors all the time, of course refs will make them aswell. Yea but the ref fucked up too. Should’ve waited for the play to end before whistling. He did that for Madrid’s second goal This is exactly why Var is needed. It’s worse really, as it’s not just the situation but it’s the same situation despite rules to the contrary.  Why even have these numpties judging offsides?  They shouldn’t be able to stop play for offside anymore, just give the ref another watch for VAR to buzz when a clear offside happens. The next big change in football will be that linesman work is no longer needed, automatic decisions pretty much similar to goal line technology is the way to go This is not VARs fault, the ref blew so the ball was dead. He should have whistled after the situation were over I'm sure the total number of wrong decisions has decreased due to VAR. VAR doesn’t matter against the financial and underlying clout and support of Real Madrid . Everyone predicted there to be at least one controversial referee call and everyone knew it would go Real Madrid’s way . It’s like a computer algorithm that has to happen . Yet again. Another example of the dumb cunts in the middle with the whistles and flags being too stupid. If the referees don't suffer the consequences of their obvious mistakes, the things will never change During the game they zoomed in on Mazraoui and you could tell the poor guy was having flashbacks, too. Yeah.   It could be offside for all we know. But there is VAR to make that decision. Not even that zooming in to draw pixel,  they have implemented semi automated one. Why not utilize that. Every week you hear complaints from fans and commentators “Why does it take so long to put the flag up when it’s offside?” This is why! The implementation of VAR has not been smooth but this again proves it’s absolutely necessary. Football is a game decided by 1-2 moments per match , you have to make sure those moments are officiated correctly. Not just VAR, they even have semi automated offsides now. ZERO reason to put the flag up in the 90+12th min of a UCL Semi There are some top notch tech in ice hockey(nhl), cricket (ipl), formula 1 and a multi billion dollar sport can't come up with proper tech to prevent stiff like this? [deleted] so genuine question, how about a linesman with no flag? Just let VAR call em all. Or too much delay then? Not the refs fault. Why you mad at him? Also used in German. Sounds extremely weird in English. Is he meaning ""that isn't worth anything to me"" or something similar? Made me watch Louis van Gaal interviews haha Don’t think it’s that weird, I understood clearly what he meant. Well that’s also part of the problem honestly. We’ll never be certain if it was on or off because we couldn’t use the semi-automated offside system due to the play being ended by the referee before it was finished. I think it was probably onside, and it probably would have been blocked/saved anyway, but it's a big if due to a refereeing error. First Nacho and after that Rudiger and Nacho backed out of the challenge. On top of that Lunin probably saved that ball. So I think people are making this bigger than it is it was onside mate [deleted] Most people will forget it in 2-3 years, well except Bayern fans. I'd bet that if Dortmund wins it, people will forget it by the end of the next UCL season > Real deserved to win  As a fellow victim of football terrorism, you guys were playing a very good away match. It's the Bernabeu, you sit back and take all the chances you can get.   IMO it was the substitutions that really killed your game. Tuchel should've kept your attackers on and started subbing in defenders at the very last minutes. It's not because Real Madrid played better that Bayern didn't deserve to be fairly refereed  I never understood that kind of take. You play bad so you can't complain about being robbed ? It was definitely a bad decision, but the truth is that Real Madrid's defenders completely stopped playing when the linesman raised the flag. I mean from that perspective... they didnt deserve to win vs city? I dont understand what you mean That’s a pretty redundant point. Teams that deserve to win game lose games all the time. How many games have Real won without deserving it tho? It’s about not following the rules not if they deserved it or not What makes it worse for me is that I am 100% confident we would have won in extra time even if Bayern scored there, which is not a given because our players stopped playing. You guys looked done, and Tuchel's subs took off all your attacking threat. Fucking linesman. Well, just Bayern fans. It's tainted. Real would have still won on extra time most probably. Or the shot wouldn't have gone in. But we will never know. I agree As a Madrid fan , deserving may not be right word to judge our matches. The ref made the wrong call and should be treated as it is and not let go just because other team deserved to win are bayern fans rooting for madrid or dortmund btw? If the opposite happened, RM would not have scored their second goal. These things matter a ton. Real had possession but I thought both teams were pretty even.. the only thing that was a clear win was the duel between Vini and Kimmich.. the rest? You guys could've made 2 or 3 more goals.. at the beginning of the game Gnabry didn't pass to Kane,  then Kane misses a chance he would normally make, then the 4v1 counter attack that you guys didn't even kick to goal lol.  As sad as it might sound Neuer's fuck up brought real back, he has 50% of the fault for the loss the other 50% your coach.. he went to chicken strat and didn't pay off.. how can he take out Kane on a game like that lmao   >this is all we’re going to talk about for the next decade  No it's not. Unless you mean Bayern? I thought they were a big enough club to not whine about an early whistle for a decade? Don’t worry king. Nothing to be sad about. Offside was correct and everyone including De Light stopped playing when the ref blew his whistle. Really nothing to lose sleep over. No they don’t deserve to win. They just robbed you once again. Again Should be written on RMs stadium 3 major mistakes de ligt draws both defenders to him “influencing the play” if he is off, the goal is invalid I mean the referee signalled 2 more minutes at 90+9. The game should have ended before this controversal call Obviously they can flag when it's a clear offside so they aren't obsolete.  Since the implementation of VAR the accepted action is to let tight calls go and let VAR assist. Not every offside ends with a goal. You still need them to quickly decide if it was offside or since that can be the difference between one team getting a free kick for offside or the other side getting a corner for example. Cant have the game interrupted by VAR for little calls like that. Linesman made a wrong decision even if it was offside as he didn't let it play out with margins in centimeters. Why would u bet on having an eagle eye especially in today's day and age, bro wanted to be main char so bad. Man, exactly the same. I still am a linesman and sometimes you clearly know that u cant flag it but u flag it, maybe your are 1 meter in front of the last defender and you see a completely different picture from reality, and you flag it and then check the video after the match... I was in the same situation already as well but it didnt matter that much. But ye, i think lino wont forgive himself.    But people are forgetting one thing!! Every1 wants 100% from the referees and as soon as they make 1 mistake, yes that in this case, it was a lethal mistake, but he might have been rock-solid in previous 100 matches and every1 loses their minds. But when a player misses in that specific game 5 encounters 1v1 vs their goalkeeper, no1 bats an eye because referee fucked them. Its simple as that. [deleted] He is a well paid professional and he made an absurdly stupid and juvenile mistake in one of the most important games of the year why the hell should anyone feel bad for him? hahaha That professional linesman is playing with VAR as back up. It's also monumentally easier not to raise your flag like you've been trained to than it is to raise your flag. Dude is rich now, who cares Won't someone think of the poor lino [deleted] By that logic, what should be done with Neuer? A human made a mistake, lets murder him. What about Neuer who made a mistake that's equally as bad for Bayern if not worse? He has no idea how close the call is but seeing the linesman raising his flag this early signals to him that the linesman is confident about the offside. Its more on the linesman who raises the flag early even though its not clear If this had happened before Joselu's second goal, we would be having the same discussion. It didn't happen and Joselu's goal was given by VAR. Honestly, given how wild this UCL season has been I really wouldn’t be surprised if that found a way in.. yes it‘s impossible to know.  Imagine getting robbed of that knowledge because the linesman made an oopsie in the last seconds of a CL semi.  This would never happen against Real. That's irrelevant though. Still robbed by the ref because there is no way of knowing what should have happened exactly, the bad call was the whistle but everything past that is immaterial. watching this i had no idea why de ligt even shot it, the play was dead for a good few seconds Yeah, Joselu deserves some respect. He came in and changed the tie. Also, Madrid were really good today, it didn't feel like Bayern were threatening at all. It's a shame that all that is overshadowed by such an unnecessary mistake. And the extra time should've ended already before that. Refeering was straight up garbage, it just wasn't relative to big decisions. Madrid was fouling, pushing, holding on every single occasion and yet somehow the ref gave them their first yellow in the 101st minute of the game. Completely set the standard in the first minute of the game where Sane was blatantly grabbed and he didn't give a foul. Most of their comebacks are tainted anyway. Like Benzema fouled Donnarumma for the comeback against PSG but nobody cares because “oil club bad” and “Madrid DNA” Damn Neuer howler... Big mistake from linesman but can’t blame Madrid players, they played until whistle He shouldn't have whistled but It's not the same situation. Rudiger and Joselu are close to each other and near the goal and Joselu immediately scores after the pass. How much faster could the referee whistle, mid pass? Because the lino made a mistake, just like Neuer made a mistake not catching the shot from Vinicius Right because they blew AFTER the goal which is fair enough, let the teams play ffs Real's goal was on the other linesman side, I think he didn't life the flag until after the goal  There was a definite hint of ""it's the 114th minute, time to end this game"" vibe from the linesman and ref >Referees as a whole really have to step it up.  It would help I think if the broadcasters put more pressure on them. Sky Sports and TNT Sports seem to barely talk about just how terrible linesmen, referees and VAR have been. They need to be called out for their incredibly low standards. The officiating in England particularly has been horrific, yet the pundits never seem to have a good go at them. They need to be held accountable. Dios es madridista Idk man, in the replay they showed on TNT it didnt look offside. The linesman was just a knucklehead. Sure human mistake, but this is one of the biggest games going on rn nd he does stupid shit like this? I mean Im not saying he was biased but if he can't handle this kinda pressure then don't let him handle big games. Most refs too. Lije why on earth would he whistle at that point? Its like they want the hate. Nd fuck me I watch laliga, so stupid refs is not a new thing. Maybe Bayern knew that they will need more extra time  against Real and they tried to make the ref to show more extra time /S  On a serious note I think that karma worked well this night, they tried to kill the game first and in the end they tried to perform a first aid What team doesn’t waste time when they are up and near the end of a game? How did you get to 111+? 90 + 13  equals to 103 minutes. There would have been no whistle in the first place, if everything would have been done by the book. Linesman flagged, ref blew whistle, players stopped.  As soon as he blew the whistle we were beyond the point of no return.   But I’ll bet you a pound to a penny next season we will still get ex players on co-commentary complaining that they don’t understand why linesman are told to delay raising their flags. VAR cannot be used once the referee blows his whistle to stop play for the offside.   Sucks I know.   High pressure mistake from the linesmen. The game went on an extra 5 minutes to let Bayern score the delusion and salt on this sub is hilarious You literally can’t tell if it’s off or not. If anything it looked on to me, but of course I’m biased. Point is you can’t blow the whistle and it’s supposed to go to VAR That's rich coming from a guy who also got hugely benefitted due to a ref decision against Bayern 😂😂😂😂 based So why not  blew the whistle when the 9 minutes ended? This We don't even know if Bayern would've scored there Why would Bayern be given a goal postgame? They scored the goals several seconds after the whistle was blown and Real Madrid defenders stopped playing after hearing the whistle. They lost out on a chance to score a goal but there is no guarantee they would have scored had the ref played on. hahahaha You're looking at the wrong player- De Ligt does not interfere in the first phase of play- the Bayern player who does is onside. While it was a huge blunder by the lines man:  If you use the same standard for the players, you gotta field a completely new 11 every season at least. I guess Neuer should retire tonight It's a mistake. We all make them. Sure it was a horrible mistake with massive consequences, but asking him to reaign is ridiculous These are the refs that exist, it's a hard job, that doesn't pay much until you're at the very top. It's not like there's a secret group of better refs sitting around.   Abusing them more, making the job worse, isn't going to bring better refs. The poor bastards didn't even get to play us (barca) so they didn't even get their enjoyment this year. That's the perfect answer, I absolutely adore what a warrior DeGoat is and his mentality perfectly captures the Mia San Mia style. That piece of dogshit coach completely shelved him for 2-3 months until everybody either got injured or went to Asia for a mid-year competition. It depends on the error. Raising the flag on a close offside around the box at this level of refereeing is an egregious error. Not all errors are the same… some are more understandable, and thus more forgivable, than others. For better or worse, it’s been decided to rely on technology in these situations, and calling offside is the main role of an AR, so to fuck it up late in a UCL semifinal match is on the unforgivable end of the spectrum. Dude has essentially one job! I don't support either team so don't really have any dog in the fight but surely the new rules are the game keeps going and it gets sorted with an offside or not after the playing phase has finished.      Ref just fucking blew up in the last minute or so of a very contentious offside decision. As a former official myself, I can confidently say that officiating (any sport) is one profession I support being taken over by technology. As a sports fan, it’s more important that the game be fair than almost anything else. Without fairness, the competition loses all meaning and integrity. Sports is one of the closest things we have in society to a meritocracy and it should be protected at all costs. I agree but there also has to be more accountability, it feels like ""shit happens, suck it up"" when you are on the receiving end.   And what's worse is that the winner for real is a carbon scenario, linesman thinks offside, no whistle, var allows it.    Double fáil from the officials that ultimately cost a team a potential final. The inconsistency, the timing and the impact should come with accountability, otherwise the recipient ends up bitter.  Disagree.  With VAR, they are not afforded such leniency, sure, before this technology; what can you do? Referees are human. To blow the whistle and bypass this technology when it is made for such a moment, doing so breaking the rules you are there to enforce. Why have referees at all.  If this continues it wont be long until refereeing is almost fully automated, which I think it already should be. They should be there to enforce the tempo of the game, and that is it. Marciniak is the best referee in the world, by a large margin IMO as well, which should illustrate exactly how poor refereeing actually is and they actually damage the integrity of the game rather than uphold it. >Although it won't comfort any Bayern fans tonight, a referee has to be entitled to make errors and be forgiven if he recognises them.  He didn't even need to make this mistake in the age of VAR, that's the worst part. It's just weird that Real often is on the side that grt an advantage out of these errors. Not the first time, not the first time against Bayern. This and the fact that they earn 100k a year when players pull that in half a week. Who wants to be yelled death threats, abused and get 100k a year? There’s a lot of less stressful jobs for that amount of money. cool story bro Imagine if all Bayern players stood around Neuer and shouted at him what an asshole he is after his mistake. People in a lot of companies get fired for a lot less. Not saying he should be fired of course, but if you make such a huge mistake at this level, I think it makes sense if he gets demoted to a lower level of football for a little while. I agree we should take steps to stop this culture of abusing the refs for everything you see it at games all the time doesn't even matter anymore if there were any egregious mistakes there is just attitude that the refs are shit no matter what.  But also just tackle mistakes head on. Release the calibrated line, let people understand how certain VAR decisions arise communicate openly with the public and help them understand.  But maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part and it just leads to more abuse. Lol, if only we had a device that could eradicate those ref mistakes... They make good money. The rules are not complex. The “mistakes” are impacting the outcome of tournaments, not games alone. In a sport that moves as much money as football, this should have been resolved many years ago.  The only explanation is that investments and bets have to be hedged, and that is what we see at the end.   A finger on the scale! Of course refs can make mistakes and I am sure 95% of fans and players would react completely differentöy to these kind of situations if refs regularly came out and gave interviews and a)explained their reasoning behind certain decisions and b) admitted mistakes when they occurred.  But for whatever reason refereeing bodoes have this assumption that they need to create this aura of infallibilty in everything.  Whether it be with VAR where the focus seems to be more on not ""embarrassing"" the onfield ref instead of getting to the right decision or other parts where any comments by players are allowed except critisizing refs in public.  Goal line technology prove that this is the case, nobody gets upset if the ref gets a goal signal when the ball is just over the line because they realise, oh ball crossed the line, fair enough. I guess most of the refs go regularly to therapy due to the constant abuse they have to take.  Frankly, they are not paid enough for how much they have to go through Horrific take. This isn't a mistake like calling a tight offside pre VAR or missing a foul on the middle of the pitch. This goes directly against the ref's training and the rules. This. I can understand the players after the game with all the emotions, adrenalin and what not but the staff, fans and everyone else being that harsh and often even abuse the refs is not excusable.  It is still a sport that has multiple humans involved and mistakes are humane. Yes in the age of the VAR they shouldn't happen and are even more painful in such games but what de Ligt say is right in this case you shouldn't blame the refs for the result. In overtime in the semi final of the Champions League, with VAR, the assistant referee should never put up his flag unless it's super super obvious offside. He made a huge mistake which is not acceptable. Well yes. But use the VAR how it was intended? Let the play run and then check it. You have the fcking technology. This isn´t 1990 anymore. Seriously.  No fucks given it was a bad call. It was a bad call give he possibilites they had. IN A FCKING SEMIFINAL GAME. The problem, is that the referees only get a slap on the rest, no accountability what so ever, that's why people and players get outraged and lash out on referees.. which is understandable.. meanwhile their errors screw over teams out of titles and or CL final spot.      I don't support abusing the referees, but they need to be held accountable for major fuckups to make sure it doesn't happen again. On the big stage this is a catastrophic error, not a minor one. Nobody raises the flag anymore with VAR. They all let it play out.  Egregious call here and that not so oddly favored real mardid. And huge mistakes have to be penalized, like in any job. This is a fat mistake. There's 0 reasons to stop the game when you know there's a VAR if you are in doubt. This mistake at the 90+ minutes of CL is inexcusable Exactly. None of these kids would be millionaires without these evil refs suiting up for work everyday This is what I keep saying with downvotes following. It's not even about errors only. VAR has brought on the illusion in football viewers that there could be solely objective calls in a football game. There can't be. If midfield 50/50's were viewed with the same scrutiny as incidents in the box, a game would last three hours. And still people wouldn't agree.    Refereeing is subjective, and the referee's authority and decisions should be respected. What the referee decides is the law.    VAR is there to help the REFEREE, not the viewers. The official is the one who makes the calls and we should live with them.    Mistakes will happen until the end of football, because most cases are not binary like is the ball over the line or not. Refs never make mistakes when the call is against Real Madrid only when it is for. Yeah, referees acknowledging mistakes shouldn't be hounded. I've seen a lot of shitty ref decisions this season, but the best thing coming from this would be them admitting mistakes.  They are in an insanely high pressure situation and know that every decision they make are gonna be picked apart by pundits and media.  Creating an envirionment where they can't learn from mistakes is bad.  Shitty call, but it is what it is Sure, turn around and compensate, lets go back to playing the last couple mins with Bayerns goal allowed, the reason referees arent allowed in the eyes of fans to make mistakes its because its easy if you did it on purpose to just say sorry afterward with no compensation whatsoever. The moment technology can take over the job it should. Compensate if you are actually sorry, if you cant compensate then your apology is completely hollow. A player mistake only really hurts their team, you should have trained more, you should put a different player on the pitch, or simply that was your ceiling, but there is no way to protect yourself from the referee [deleted] Never said he didn't. We need a VAR for the VAR This is the way. See what you’re saying but then the issue is in actions where the team with the offside player gets involved and retains possession…when does VAR get a chance to review if play doesn’t stop? I think the rules as is fine when they’re applied, unfortunately lino didn’t apply it Thats a stupid take because linesman do much more than the occassional offside decision. I’m not saying this is the VARs fault. All I’m saying is that we have VAR to check close calls like this yet the referee decided to whistle too early I think he means that VAR should be serving as a cleanup crew for these, so when the linesman is unsure they are asked to let it go, instead this time he called it way too early and without being sure Yeah that's OP's point.   VAR was introduced to help ref with these situations so they don't have to make fast decisions on close call. Lino thought Fuck VAR, we never had VAR when I was young. Honestly it's on the assistant ref for raising the flag too early. Center ref can only react to what other refs tell him. That’s literally what they’re saying Hat er gar nicht gemeint If the ref was looking to favour Madrid in this game, why didn't he just stop the play at 101th min like he had indicated at 99th minute? Why let the play go on for another 2 minutes? Are you saying ""the financial and underlying clout and support of Real Madrid"" forced the ref to give more time to Bayern? Make it make sense. It was so incredibly tight that there was 0 chance the linesman could've called it immediately. Shite decision all around. Even if it turned out to be offside. Because ref already whistled I've been saying this for years. Maybe now people will understand. It's better if refs hesitate and then overturn the action rather than kill it prematurely with a bad call. Definitely, I only ever complain when I see a clear offsides that gets a player injured, I’m specifically referencing Ederson and Stones for City against I think Newcastle and Everton, but for these just let it go, simple as that Fully agreed with this, most of the time they take it way too far the other way and risk injuries of players by letting the play go on despite a clear offside.   However, De Ligt's goal was still an extreme case. He didn't even wait 3-4 seconds to see what happened It can't because ref blew the whistle and RM players stopped playing. So they can't just award goal that maybe would not happen if play continued You cannot give the goal after the Madrid players stopped. It would be more unfair than the original incorrect call. You cannot tell players to “play to the whistle” and then penalize them for stop playing when the whistle blows I think the linesman just needs to use common sense. If he is 250% certain it is offside, give it. Otherwise let it play a little. The higher percentage that he is sure it was offside the less he lets it play unless it is a very clear scoring opportunity. ref should not have whistled even with the flag up. wait for the play to end, then whistle for offside. I wonder how well Matthijs speaks German already, these are the little things that make you use the language very well. What is it in German? it’s my first language but this one’s lost on me right now not dutch but my country also has a similar expression. seems like its basically “cant buy shit with apologies” Pretty much yes The footage is still there, they could just show us, but I bet we would have seen that by now if it was offside. they didn't delete the match footage mate, VAR and anyone with the technology can rewatch it and see both players were off on the long ball. Yeah I see a lot saying it would have been a goal but militao clearly gave up The problem is we don't know, what if they go for it and it deflects and wrong foots the keeper? What if they go for it and block the keepers view? The players should have been able to play - that's the issue It’s because it’s Madrid lol “Real Madrid got favorable decisions in the CL like this all the time. Stop being a baby and get used to it. It’s not that serious.” Yeah, Lunin was not saving that.  Edit: actually yeah, i thought it was right next to the post, but just watched it again, definitely savable How can you be so sure? We have so many images of it and there's still no consensus. Honestly, if my life depended on it I'd say it's offside.  Should've let the play continue anyways. [citation required] And it was a free shot after the whistle was blown. Maybe it wasn’t offside and play should have continued but it also wasn’t a guaranteed goal like people are trying to insinuate just because it was an uncontested volley. Looks that way, but after the ref whistle madrid player stopped the play and lunin didn't dive either. Nacho backed out of the challenge too. Its a big mistake by the linesman but everything is ""if"" and ""buts"" rn Doesn’t matter game should have ended a minute before Bayerns attack Whistle before Muller plays the ball, even Nacho stopped at going him. No they won’t. A lot of people still cry about Madrid - Bayern 2017 and even Barca - Chelsea 2009. 15 years ago The culers will keep every receipt of it, don't worry. People won’t forget. They still talk about our offside goals vs you in 2017 but somehow seem to forget about your offside goal or you guys unfair penalty from the first leg. People remember whatever they want It won’t matter too much if the final in Munich is won People still talk about the Real 3 titels in a row Real won, nobody talks that they would have won 0 with a VAR Something [similar to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk5yJhlAS1Y&ab_channel=GoldScore). This was at 0:1 and RM had absolutely no momentum in the game up to that point. They later ofc went on to win the tournament. Unfortunately Kane and Musiala were injured according to Tuchel. But yeah - he should’ve used Tel instead of EMCM… It's simply because they weren't robbed if we're being honest  This is not some missed pen or a falsely given goal. It was a chance that ended up being a goal because the Madrid defenders + GK stopped defending due to the whistle. In reality there was a very low chance that a chance like this ends up in a goal.  And even if it did, Bayern would have to survive another 30min after subbing off their entire attack. They got immediately conceded 2 goals within 10 minutes after subbing off Kane. They would have to convert a low percentage chance + survive another 30min + win pens, chance for all of to happen would be extremely low like not even 1% Lunin barely moves. I know it’s absolutely an error. But it denies a chance, not a goal. This is assuming it was onside in the first place. To have everyone scream robbery is very frustrating but it is what it is. Ref ruined a great CL win. Yep. But one can only wonder what would have followed. The curse of football is that it always has to end, when all anyone ever wants is the magic to continue. He doesn’t blow his whistle till the ball is going to De Ligt. Lunin yeah, but it was a brilliant finish, debatable if he’d have saved it or not This is why I hate it when people trot out this line in games where a team was playing shit and didn't given a penalty for example. Teams play shit and win, and play well and lose/draw regularly.  At the end of the season, all that matters are points. There's no trophy for 'deserved to win'. Totally agree - you probably would’ve scored at least another one. But we don’t know that for sure and Tuchel terror ball could’ve kept us alive. The not knowing part is the worst > What makes it worse for me is that I am 100% confident we would have won in extra time even if Bayern scored there,  I believe so too but having somebody taking the chance away just sucks for a variety of reasons. Imho bayern beat themselfs (essentially 3 gifted goals plus disasterclass Tuchel)  Oh well, thats football. Not always fun, not always fair. Or the ref would have actually ended the match on time and all of this wouldn’t have happened. Just a thought. Not many Bayern fans think that from what I'm reading, but thank god you just popped by to do all the thinking for them. Madrid dominated the game, and even if Bayern equalised in the end they would gotten destroyed in extra time with all their best players off. What did we rob? an extra 30 minutes without their best players on the field? 🧂🧂? If you think Real Madrid didn’t deserve to win you didn’t watch the game brother When our best attacking player today is called Alfonso Davies it is really hard to argue we deserved to go through man This Are we inventing mistakes now? the ref can extend as long as he wants. if you waste 2min in the 2min he signalled he can add another 2 min. and then another if you continue to waste time. Linesmen make more decisions than just offsides as well I'm not sure why people are saying this. You people act like this is a pre VAR call and he made a slight mistake. All he has to do is do nothing and let VAR handle it and he knows it. He actively went against what they are told to do here.  Your comparison also makes no sense because i strongly assume you don't have VAR on the level you ref and you have to make a call on the field. I understand when refs get it wrong on onside/offside in real time but thats not needed here.   This lineman has no business in professional football. The way people are talking about the issue, you might think he may lose his job altogether. ""Well paid professional"". In terms of percent, he gets <0,1% of what footballers get and peak referee age is at around 40, whilst footballers 20-25. its not easy to get to such lvl of refereeing. The best footballers miss sitters every once in a while do they not?  Referees miss relatively easy decisions every so often.  Both are human and it's a damn shame when it happens in the biggest game of the season. You've clearly never in your life held a flag and had the job of calling offside let alone officiate in any capacity.     It is extremely difficult to not raise the flag once you identify an offside, rightly or wrongly. It is as you've said ""biomechanics."" [deleted] They're talking about fully automated offsides, not the semi-automated offside that VAR uses. It would be like goal line tech, the referee would get a signal on their watch. Neuer cost them one goal but saved them from at least two. He's a net positive. I honestly don’t think so. Something similar was the Real Madrid vs Valencia game this year when the ref blew the whistle as the ball was being crossed in. The consensus was “it was way past the extra time” and “Valencia players stopped play what do you want them to do”. Now that it happened to Real Madrid it’s being blown out of proportion because Real Madrid bad. The difference is pretty obvious and that's that Joselu's goal came immediately after a potential offside. There was no time for anyone to look at a flag raised or a whistle blown. To Bayern's misfortune more time elapsed between the flag and the potential goal. Or found its way into Bayern’s net after counter. Just don’t know 🤨🤨🤨 What do you mean it would never happen to Real? If they really wanted Real to win they wouldn't have disallowed Nacho's goal, or the ref would have ended the game in the 99 minute instead of waiting for the 105th.   It was just a terrible decision by the ref, that is all. This happened just a couple of months ago in La Liga against real. It did this season, in the match against Valencia.  For whatever reason, when Madrid is on the losing end of a bad decision, it's always bad luck. When they are on the winning end, everybody screams ""corruption!"" I mean it happen to us in the league lol and also the game should have ended a minute before so Bayern chance shouldn’t even exist >This would never happen against Real.  Clearly we all imagined the match against Valencia It literally has happened to us and was worse than this as the ball was mid air after a shot but no go on with your narrative Literally a situation even worse than this happened in the league against valencia, but of course people only care about the bad calls if it isn't against real madrid /u/Available-Ad3881 is really bringing up 16/17, where Vidal was sent off for a non-foul, Casemiro wasn't sent off for a clear 2nd yellow card, Lewandowski was called back for a non-offside (which offsets the offside goal), and Ronaldo scored 2 clear offside goals.  > Didn't you score an offside goal vs us in 16/17 that took the game to ET? With Ramos involved? Absolutely pathetic behaviour this. No surprise Bayern is going trophyless. This I got that feeling too. They were panicking as in ""fuck, I should've ended this already, I can't have a goal happening now and get all the unwanted attention"". And then they did even worse. [deleted] Every team does, the team i support do it. I just mean it doesnt feel right, you time waste, defend that lead u got, than the score changes and suddenly you have to attack but luckily you get the long extra time for what you wasted rolling on the ground, taking long time for free kicks, thrown in etc. Its just doesnt sound fair you know. You gave up those mins, wasting away but suddenly you need them and get them It looked on to me as a neutral too. I'm pretty sure Real would have won on extra time anyways. But now it's a tainted result on a match that was looking great honestly. How’s that even relevant? I’m not the referee This is a hypotetical question, I asked this using the situation of the thread as an example. [deleted] Didn't even ship 10 goals past Arsenal in the RO16. Truly a season to be disappointed about He wanted to go to Barca in the year they signed de Jong. Now Barca plays with Araujo. A nothing worthy Barca player in my opinion This might literally be a multimillion Euro error after all Agreed. Fucking absurd decision. Yeah his one job, in that moment, was literally to do nothing. Don't raise a flag...someone would review it. Sit tight. Sorry but your analogy totally fails. The beauty and intrigue of sport is in player mistakes. Not officiating errors. Neuer also has one job and he dropped the ball and cost his team a goal and a final. Tuchel made subs that were questionable at best and I'd say cost his team the final. Is anyone talking about either of them? Not at all.  And the best part is, you don't even know if this error influenced the score. The defenders stopped playing after the whistle. Tuchel and Neuer definitely influenced the score.   Referees are held to an impossible standard, much higher one than players and coaches. They're not getting paid better than players or coaches. It's not right. Goalkeeper dropping the ball at a striker's feet at this level is an egregious error. catching the ball is the main role of the Goalkeeper so to fuck it up late in a UCL semi final is unforgivable. Dude had one job. I'm sure UEFA / FIFA have guidelines to encourage refs and assistants to keep important plays going and only call a potential offence after, so that VAR can recommend a review if needed. But, as far as the rules go, they are absolutely in the right to make as immediate decision. IFAB's VAR Protocol (https://www.theifab.com/laws/latest/video-assistant-referee-var-protocol/#procedures) states the following:  ""The referee and other match officials are not permitted to give ‘no decision’ as this will lead to ‘weak/indecisive’ officiating, too many ‘reviews’ and significant problems if there is a technology failure""  ""Delaying the flag/whistle for an offence is only permissible in a very clear attacking situation when a player is about to score a goal or has a clear run into/towards the opponents’ penalty area""  See how it's phrased as a ""permission"" and not a ""requirement"".  Just to be perfectly clear: Bayern's attack was EXACTLY the kind of play where the flag/whistle should've been delayed. Close offsides / onsides are the most objective case scenario for VAR review and there's even a semi-automatic tech going on nowadays. But neither the ref nor the assistant infringed the rules by making an immediate call, unfortunate as it was. I don’t support either team but Madrid keeps getting through on dumb shit and it sucks for neutrals because they play ugly football. I swear at this point, if I have to watch Toni Kroos hoof the ball up to Vini one more time I might just turn my tv off. And how should the linesman/refereeing team be punished? Name and shame and publish their addresses so that people can show up on their doorstep? Fined? Thrown in jail?   Marciniak likely lost the opening game of the Euros because of this game, an overall good (or even great) performance but with mistakes in three key situations. But what else should happen in terms of accountability? > If this continues it wont be long until refereeing is almost fully automated, which I think it already should be.   Agreed completely. The execution of video refereeing has been shambolic but in the long run it makes so much sense having the on pitch referee do nothing but the basics with the video referee being the one in charge of everything.   It actually blows my mind we make a middle aged bloke run off the pitch to look at a fucking tiny screen. Why the fuck can the video referee not make this decision? Stop giving the cunts on the pitch so much power for no reason. The WC final also wasn't refereed amazingly by him. I don't know why people rate him so highly. The putting the flag up/blowing the whistle early is the mistake being referred to. Like the Dortmund guy said, its often against german teams. IDK why, but in the last seasons Dortmund and Leipzig got fucked hard by refs. Most of the time against city etc. Nobody cares about Leipzig, thats why its often ignored, but its noticeable often. Trust me you are preaching to the choir here, we lost a Champions League final to them with an offside goal.. I have thought the same many times but for my mental health I choose to give the refs the benefit of the doubt most of the time  Just like opponents are subconciously intimidated by their history, so are referees sometimes I think. We literally had one of our goals disallowed until the players complained enough for it to be VAR checked. Idk what you're suggesting here. Bayern had a lead with 3 minutes to go, made some terrible subs then bottled it. Are Tuchel and Neuer on it too ? Real is almost always the best team with more attacking chances, as they were today, so it's more likely a mistake will go in their favour just by the odds. Ironic Never said you were wrong and both controlled by Perez Who VARs the VAR? Refs will still find a way to make this shit happen again Once the VAR for VAR spots that the ref made a mistake he will then be forced to make a pen against the keeper of the team that was faulted, should the ref miss he will be promptly given a red card and will have to leave the field. It's VAR all the way down. Asi gana Madrid If there's a constant top down view tech where you can tell either automatically or very easily if someone is offside by a 1m or more. They should just do the subjective calls in big competitions if they have the technology to automate offsides Loop back to the linesman raising too early Yeah thats the problem.   Why whistle on that close when you have VAR Imo there are very, very few times that the flag should go up without the play finishing out. There is little to no downside. Players can get hurt on any play. Yeah, it's completely a human mistake from the ref team. Nonsense. What's the point of a linesman ever flagging for offside if the referee is the one who has to make the judgement? His German is very good, but he does have a very noticeable Dutch accent Davon kann ich mir nichts kaufen Bayern will definitely demand to get that footage. From the replay of the situation they showed on DAZN, it didn’t look offside at all. Seems like it was extremely close.  https://twitter.com/ArchivoVAR/status/1788323086216896948/photo/1 i don’t think the player who plays the ball is offside, rudiger a foot by de ligts shoulder is playing him on True, I think I should’ve said that we’d have a higher degree of certainty of whether it was offside or not if the play had been allowed to finish and VAR could have used the semi-automated offside system to conclude whether it was offside or not (because that should provide us with a smaller degree of uncertainty than the human drawn lines made by fans that we will be getting now). I know, but people calling it a ‘disallowed goal’ are just wrong. I agree it’s a mistake from the lino, but there’s so much happening after the call that you can’t call it a disallowed goal Why is no one talking about the scene happening in 12:30 overtime tho? There were 9 minutes to play and the ref just let the game go on and on. There weren't 3:30 minutes worth of extra extra time within the first 9 minutes. This scene never happens. Exactly, we don't know. So it's not a robbery, just a bad offside call. Impressive display of illiteracy You underestimate him I’ve seen lunin make that save before. It’s not like it was side netting or upper 90. How do you know? [Citation](https://x.com/archivovar/status/1788323086216896948?s=46&t=e0tjKaN0KmklbDmWtjRq7A) tf_17. “R/Soccer.” Reddit, www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/GoJRVhGLVC. Accessed 8 May 2024. But that's the problem. Nobody claims that this would have been onside and a goal for sure.  But a clear chance was denied for an absolute ridiculous and unnecessary call. The call had the risk of being wrong, a no call would have been overturned by VAR anyway. So it is absolute insane to raise the flag here, when simply doing nothing had 0 risk for the refs. the ball was barely in play during the first 5 minutes of ET lmao Because in 2017 we were at least on par with you, not like some midtable clowns parking the bus. Chelsea 2009 was a dozen mistakes, this one is one by and the linesman and he already apologized. It sucks for bayern but the comparison is off This is not comparable to Barca - Chelsea 2009, there were multiple massive ""mistakes"" in that match.  Here, it's one instance and if referee didn't blow the whistle, there was a chance the Real Madrid players would block the shot. It's still a big mistake, but it's not comparable to 2009 game. Chelsea barca had more and worse calls, i don’t even remember the Bayern madrid 2017 controversy or see people bring it up much at all. Barca - Chelsea was absolutely egregious. And it's not like UEFA is known for its probity in these matters. Comparing this to Chelsea Barca 2009 is comical. That game deserved a government investigation. Well I mean because those goals/decisions Decided the tie. Even if Bayern scores it still goes to extra time and you should know by now that madrid are killers in ET People still cry about the 1966 World Cup final ... Lol this is nothing compared to those matches I still cry about Nani’s red card I love that shit, thanks for feeding us Just like every team does with their rival... Rent free And Bayern would have probably won another since then. lmao Well the 2017 one was something else and is mostly remembered because 2/3 goals from Ronaldo were clearly offisde. It's usually the prime example that people give for why we needed VAR checks for offsides. I agree tho that we had an offside goal in the tie but the offside hattrick is more memorable as a ref fuckup Every Madrid fan also forgets the ref incorrectly calling offside for both Muller and Lewandoksi when they were through on goal in the same game. Funny how that works. Tbh a lot of people do talk about that > In reality there was a very low chance that a chance like this ends up in a goal.  How high was the chance of Neuer fumbling? Very low.   The ball could've been deflected by a defender making it impossible so save. Low chances happen in football, that's why we love it.     I mean how high were the chances of PSG hitting the post that oftne yesterday? Pretty much this. There's no way to know what would have happened or if it was even onside to begin with. But the clarity of the error will cast doubt on the result for sure. If nothing else Bayern were denied a last gasp opportunity to score which may well have happened. Lunin is the only one that really stops. The defenders appear to play on until the shot is taken. Who knows what would've happened if play continued, but there is a very good chance it still would've resulted in a goal. Also why the fuck was the game still going in the 103 minute when there were ""only"" 9 minutes stoppage time and 2 additional minutes signaled by the ref. I think he completely lost the grip on the game at the end. That's just not true, like why lie about something that's verifiable by video. Yes that is the case with the whistle but the flag was raised before that and the Real Madrid defenders were looking straight to the linesman since the ball was in that direction. You can even see the defenders completely relax when the flag was raised.  Unfortunately we will never know what would have happened, a very bad decision by the linesman. What did you expect after 2 minutes of var check, a minute and a half of celebrations, a minute long goal kick and rudigers cramp all happening in the first 5 minutes of the added time Lmfao what an idiot there's no ""on time"". it falls under the refs discretion That The second Madrid goal was offsides, the second Bayern wasn't offsides, and Kane was fouled from behind in the box. Oh and Nacho never got carded for hitting a player in the face. That’s why i said take off the offside calling. People say “obviously they can only call clear calls” but there’s been too many examples that say it’s not that obvious to them. Unnecessary ambiguity. A slight mistake? This scenario is nightmare fuel for linos everywhere.  Every person that has actually held a flag in their life knows how instinctual it is to raise the flag once you think a play is offside. It is like trying to resist flinching. We have VAR. THe problems I did, were without VAR but the problem is because sometimes u officiate on lower levels as well and its not as easy to switch from one to another. its like, you are used to breaking and steering with ABS and then one of a sudden someone takes your ABS away. its easy to say, YES, DONT DO NOTHING but referees also have controllers behind them and u need to make the most correct calls without VAR in order to receive a positive grade. Its easy for you laics to say who was never a referee. What a nonsense comment, he makes <0,1% because his job requires less than 0,1% of the talent and hard work of footballers. Guy just needed to do nothing and not lift the flag and he failed, that’s it Those misses involve something known as ""physics"" and ""biomechanics"". Those errors made are completely different than that of a match official who was trained to not raise their flag during a play raising their flag during a play. Why is a linesman so trigger happy to raise their flag in the age of VAR? They're supposed to raise the flag after the play is dead/out of play. Why is it difficult to go against your training? Well since Var introduced i have never seen a side ref raise a flag in an attack like that anywhere else. Sometimes even when the offside is 3-5m they still let it play out, but Semi Final in UCL and oopsie. Even refs in the bulgarian league dont stop that and let it play out… [deleted] But that was a full time whistle, not an offside call. not saying they rigged it for Real on purpose. Just saying the linesman wouldn‘t have had that reaction if it was Real. He would have let them play on.  Which isn‘t an insane take, i think? Real do play like stone cold killers, but they also have the refs on their side in quite many situations. ah yes, once. Much better. Honestly, that was so crazy that it does feel like a fever dream… Oh yeah, I forgot the penalty they gifted you in the first leg. Oops. ""non foul"" ahahahah [Idk man, its too close. Maybe it is off but you cant say its clear](https://postimg.cc/MvRKwRYt) Real talk: Ref did us a favor. Real would have killed is in overtime. The point is that humans make mistakes, the refs were fine too until the last minute. But the fans saved having to wait 60 seconds, so it's worth it. The chance that was a multimillion euro error is 1% at best. What a stupid opinion. It's a game, the whole reason of why it's popular for people and a huge money industry is that these mistakes can happen. Everyone who gets involved knows about the chance they take, if you get mad at the system when you lose you're objectively stupid. That's the thing, these guys don't want to do nothing. They want to be the hero rather than sticking to basics and letting the game be decided by more than the vision of a middle aged bloke.  Let's be honest now nobody knows or gives a fuck about any linesman. They're nothing special. So why try and be special? Just enjoy having the luxury of a job where you can do fuck all in these positions because that's literally what you've been told to do when it's close. > Sorry but your analogy totally fails.  What analogy? Then fuck off with VAR all together. Then  Real wins even more CL because refs obviously have a hard one for this shit show of a team. As was visible before VAR was implemented. Yeah bud, Tuchel fucked it. Not sure why he wouldn’t sub on Goretzka. Makes no sense Who said punished? What a wild take  The problem with this sort of situation is that the lack of transparency doesn't allow us to know what kind of consequences these poor decisions have.   The situation, when it comes to refereeing at least, looks like this. A referee makes a mistake and the only ones that suffer consequences are the players and the fans.  The most we get is a ""We're sorry"" from some organization. We've gotten to the point that we are seeing A LOT of mistakes week in and week out and we have no idea if they even matter, presumably they take these into account when they decide assignments, but we have no idea. We don't know how the referees are selected even though there obviously must be some criteria they use. We see so many referees that don't do well and I can't help thinking that surely there must be someone that's better, maybe there isn't but they have to show it to us rather than take a ""Trust me bro"" approach. Of course everyone thinks that refs can do whatever the hell they want. The lineman should never be in a professional match ever again. Simple. Yeah...? I feel like it’s mostly Spanish and English teams that get the good end of the stick okay, but do you think there's actually even a tiny chance of a conspiracy there?  Like that UEFA instructed the refs to be harder on German teams, because the Bundesliga doesn't reign in that much money? Forgetting Neuer on Saka and Kane elbow on Gabriel? Victim complex much? We have the Champions League, the US has Wrestlemania. I don’t really care but I have to address this. How in the world, does that referee mistake means that they get intimidated by Madrid’s history? By that metric, the nacho “goal” should’ve stood no?   This “Madrid always gets the referee’s whistle thing “has to stop. Referee made a mistake, I don’t know if the linesmans told De Ligt that (that’s a terrible admission), earlier in the thread you made a good point and now you say this…  Siempre tienes las peores opiniones cuando se trata del club, es increíble. Errors happen all the time, last year the ball went out which led to the KDB goal, would that have changed anything? Not likely. You mean the scene where Kimmich gets a two handed face massage? That's irrelevant. If Bayern had a 6 goal lead and threw it away in 2 minutes, that's irrelevant to this. In the era of VAR, every single possible offside play is allowed to finish before checking. Sometimes it's a 3 meter offside, and it's still allowed to finish. What happened today goes beyond a simple mistake. It's either gross incompetence, or on purpose. If Bayern shit the bed, that's a different issue. Let them shit the bed, but make sure everything that happens happens according to the rules. Like when they played Leipzig? Or when Ronaldo scored twice from an offside position? (Madrid players afteards acknowledging it laughing) It must be nice to have the odds in your favour. You like my VAR, you like it? for the turtle,  by the turtle Lol.   The whole drama is going around in circle  Ref shouldn't have whistled-> Linesman shouldn't have raised -> Ref shouldn't have whistled -> repeat.. Horrible mistake. They fucked up a big time. I think the linesman is only supposed to put the flag up during play if it is clear as day. It's on the lineman here And this is the frustration, or part of it. Zero accountability and not even an explanation of what the officials were thinking.   I agree that hounding a ref is not beneficial, but if you want to improve anything, you have to make people responsible for big decisions accountable, otherwise we're doomed to see this constantly.  And I don’t think it was actually offside. That should have been 2-2. He whistled cos linesman raised the flag, which means ""he thought"" it was pretty sure that it was offside. I guess it's just instints kicking in. Still mega stupid tho, unacceptable I get it I guess, but this type of mistake shouldn’t be happening, it’s not even like the ref didn’t do something, he did something extra in raising the flag when he wasn’t 100% sure nonsense? the point is to always play to the whistle. and with VAR, linesmen are told to not raise their flags prematurely unless they are 100% sure, and refs are told to not blow the whistle unless the play stops.   not as much blame lies in the ref, but he had the executive decision to blow the whistle when he saw the flag, when he knows he should wait. Almost all dutch can speak german. Yes, I agree, to me Rüdiger's foot plays Mazraoui onside by inches, but I mean UEFA won't show the semi-automated analysis with the barrier, like they've shown for the 2-1.   It won't change anything, but if it had been offisde, it would take some of the heat the refs are getting. Jesus that's so fucking close. de ligt's knee is in line with rudiger's elbow, half his fuckign leg is off mate. he interferes with play by virtue of being in that position. Goal and VAR check took a while along with the time wasting. Those aren't mutually exclusive. They weren't robbed the equalizer, but a big chance to score the equalizer Yeah I thought it was in fact next to the post, but just watched it again. Definitely savable. I completely agree. I have no doubt that the ref and the assistant made a blunder. I am more-so commenting against people saying it was a sure thing and bayern got robbed. Sure mate Parking the bus almost worked though Real won several champions being absolutely dominated in some legs Dortmund done it last night and got praised for it. Don’t think it’s anything to be ashamed about you do what you have to do Don’t see how it’s relevant. Stevie Wonder could see Madrid was the better team today but a lot of people are still crying Who are the midtable clowns parking the bus? Plenty of things went in Chelsea’s favour too those games Yeah it's so funny how up in arms people are about the ""goal"" when the keeper and everyone else literally stopped moving because of the whistle. If De Ligt's shot went wide or over nobody at Bayern would have kicked up a fuss. People bring up 2017 because of 2 offside goals from Ronaldo. Which were offside.   But they conveniently forget that they came in extra time, which only happened because of a Lewandowski offside. Game should’ve never went to ET. Barca got a red card for nothing and were also robbed off two blatant penalties if we look at the first game of the two as well. I’m saying this as a Real Madrid fan They don’t care. Madrid won 6-3 on aggregate in 2017 and Bayern also scored an offside goal (Lewandowski offside on Ramos’ own goal) but they still cry Yeah they are What they also fail to remember is that Bayern should have been playing most of second half with 10 men after ref failed to give Vidal 2nd yellow Selective memory when it comes to Madrid and CL refs Yes and if you use extremely unlikely scenarios for your agenda then each team can claim they were robbed 10 times every single game because theoretically even a freekick in your own half or a throw in can lead to a goal.  It's about using your brain and being realistic You can see that both Rüdiger and Militao relaxes when the whistle is blown, sure Militao has a half-assed attempt to block when de Ligt takes the shot, but neither of them goes to close him down which is what defenders would have done in that situation. Cause added time is the minimum extra time, not the total The whistle goes as Muller is heading it to De Ligt? No defender stops? Guess what? The ref gestured the extra two minutes on top of the 9 after all that. Good try, though. Better luck next year, buddy. Did you not see the review for offside for Madrid second goal? Pretty clearly onside but go ahead and cry about a game that’s already over Ok hughmungusjohnson How to recognize a clueless yank: calling offside ”offsides” You have no business reffing in a higher league either if you are to stupid to switch between there is VAR and there isnt just like this lineman. less than 0,1% talent u said hahahaa. Insane. Give every footballer a whisle or a flag. Less than 0,1% of them can actually do it. Thats why referee peaks later because u need brain to be a referee and understand rules which are complicated. Thats why footballers dont even know the rules which THEY SHOULD. Its like, driving a car and not knowing traffic rules. Amazing huh?   The same as Nacho, pushes kimmich with both hands and than yells to the ref. And also, the pressure you need to sustain. Probably you would shit yourself when 10 players would come running directly to you when you whisteled a penalty in sunday league... You are just a typical stereotype fan, zero football knowledge. U probably dont even know why penalty area has arc line at the top of it. You are incorrect about so many things involving officiating.   1) The act of raising the flag for any reason while the ball is in play (such as signaling for offside or a foul) is to inform the referee that the match needs to be stopped. The assistant referee is not going to wait for the ball to go out of play to raise the flag if someone has been punched in the face and the referee misses it for whatever reason. The referee then has to use his judgement of blowing the whistle and when to blow the whistle OR tell the assistant to put his flag down and let play continue. So EVEN IF the assistant's flag is early, the decision to stop the game, when to stop the game, or wave the flag down, falls on the referee.  2) Raising the flag early is a normal reflex. A reflex is defined as an automatic and involuntary bodily action in response to a stimuli. It is no different than blinking when an object gets too close to your eyes. It is incredibly difficult go against a natural bodily reaction. I never mentioned objectivity, it just has to be better than a linesman. Goal line tech has failed less than a handful of times over thousands of matches, but the absence of it easily causes controversies like we've seen in the last clasico. That’s the point lol, The whistle is the whistle. One of the first things your taught in almost any sport is to play until you hear a whistle. Real Madrid players stopped, Lunin didn’t even attempt to save it. It’s not like the shot was upper 90 or side netting. Is ""once"" the same as ""never""? Don't strain yourself on the goalposts. Yes, that was the only decision that ever went unfairly against Madrid.   Must be nice having a scapegoat for Bayern's terrible performance. How's the coach search going? Everybody's lining up? [This is a yellow-card foul?](https://i.imgur.com/Llhj74Q.png) [deleted] Closer to 10 seconds Ok Huso, no need to get all condescending. The reason why we have VAR is for exactly these situations. The whole match was called lopsidedly and this call was the cherry on top. So what do you mean by accountability? I think consequences (in terms of future assignments) are more common in domestic competitions than European ones. 6 months ago, or even a year ago, you could have easily guessed the handful of names who'd end up doing CL semis and final. So it's not a complete mystery how they're chosen. Then of course nationality comes into play depending on the teams that progress. We'll see the same in the Euros.   But then on a domestic level there's also the question of how much you can afford to set your top referees aside because of poor performances. If Taylor has a howler one week, and the next week there are three really important games, he's still likely to get one of those because the option is using far less experienced referees.   There's a clear hierarchy on both of those levels, add to that that PGMOL for instance, and UEFA, have their own favourites (and ""political"" choices like always having refs of a certain nationality picked).   I see a lot of complaints that ""they protect each other too much"", and I guess there has to be a balance to it. Are you going to perform better knowing that if you have a poor game, you're demoted for a few months? Or will you be more  confident when you know that your employer trusts you and will stick up for you? Let's also not forget that there isn't an infinite pool of refs to pick from, replacing the bad ones sounds great until you realize that you'll run out of refs in about a month that way if the r/soccer crowd would get to decide who's good and bad. [deleted] This is funny from a PSG flair. And I obviously could care less about Newcastle but..  https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/186816g/psg_1_1_newcastle_kylian_mbapp%C3%A9_penalty_908/ TV money 99% chance this lino just made a mistake.  It's daft I know, but there is no doubt that the people running clubs like Real and City have influence with UEFA. Could there be a tiny chance that some refs or linos accept bribes in some form? It's probably not uncommon. Especially when you look at the refereeing scandals in Spain or Italy generally, and all the financial irregularities at City. Ironic >I don’t really care but I have to address this. How in the world, does that referee mistake means that they get intimidated by Madrid’s history? By that metric, the nacho “goal” should’ve stood no?  If it wasn't for VAR, Nacho's goal **would've been stood**, you're just contradicting your point with that example, the ref on a pressure situation couldn't see the error, VAR assistance was needed to correct him.  In the offside play, the linesman error is so monumental he even fucks up the chance for VAR to either give him the right call, or overturn it.  You can't be that naive to think playing at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid ia a big part on turning around games in the last minutes like it happened against City in 3 minutes, or yesterday, and at the same time believe the same pressure doesn't apply to the referees who are the guys most criticized by everyone on the stadium. Relax, I just think that it takes a little bit more to give a penalty to the away team at Bernabeu for example than it does in most other stadiums.   And that is something that happens with big teams in every country pretty much, referees know that making a mistake against them will make their life hell so it takes a little more. It just so happens that Madrid are the biggest team in the Champions League so have that dynamic there aswell  It's the same reason why even the biggest teams turn to jelly at the Bernabeu in the final minutes, because the name Real Madrid scares them. Referees are only human of course they can also be affected by things like that  >Siempre tienes las peores opiniones cuando se trata del club, es increíble  Dude, I was literally defending the referee here. You should be directing that at everyone calling it a robbery instead of me lol Joselu second goal. No idea how many games you watched this season but terrible calls happen;  I can give you the example of Bellingham scoring a winner and the ref whistling final time mid-air.  Suggesting a ref who was impartial all game gived Madrid a call on purpose in the dying seconds is beyond ludicrous.  I mean they are failsafes, if the linesman fucks up, the ref can continue the play. But both botching their duties together is so unfortunate and understandably infuriating for bayern and their fans.  I don't know if punishing people will make referees do their job better. It's not like they're trying to fuck up out there. It's not necessarily a goal, real Madrid stopped defending. Lunin didn't even dive. Not necessarily. The Real players stopped when they heard the whistle, so the goal could have not happened if the ref held the whistle as well. The goal was the result of the whistle which interrupted the play. Who knows what would happen without the whistle. The refs made a mistake, but it is an overclaim that it cancelled a goal. It's the linesman job to call the offside, if referees start regularly second-guessing what the linesman has seen as an offside then what's the point of having linesmen in the first place?  Yes, blaming the ref and expecting the ref not to blow for offside when his assistant has flagged for it is nonsense. [deleted] Not like they speak English. It's so weird that people say that De Light can't be offside as the ball didn't go directly to him. His presence means that defenders must react to him and are drawn out of position. de ligt does not interfere at all, he doesn’t go to the ball. otherwise half of the goals scored from corners and crossed would be offside lmao.   it’s rudiger a foot which u can see by de ligts shoulder vs the other bayern players knee, and it looks onside Honestly, nobody can know for sure unless the lines are drawn. Everything else is speculation from you and anyone else. No he doesn't interfere with play. That means playing the ball, preventing an opponent from playing the ball or blocking the goalkeeper's sight that's not how interfering from an offside position works at all. So like I said, they weren't robbed. The first 3 minutes were spent on VAR decision and celebrations. The it was in play for 10 seconds until an injury break for >1 minute. Then it was in play for 20 more seconds. So during the first 5 minutes of ET, the ball was in play for 30 seconds. He's not wrong what? vinicius going down a wing 1 versus 4 for 80 minutes wasn't the slightest bit threatening lol. you just put an extra man on him, and kick it out. stoke could do it. It's pretty obvious if you watched the game today Not sure why you are being downvoted, but as I recall it this really was the case. I dont remember specific situations, but I remember there being terrible decisions both ways. Of course only the ones favouring Barca are remembered as they won And a red to Ballack for several yellow cards in the first game and a red for an blatant tackle with the cleats on Iniesta's calf on the second... Hala Spain. You very conveniently forget that the referee also called a wrong offside when both Muller and lewy were basically 1v1 with the keeper. Like yeah, they scored an offside goal, but they were also wrongfully denied two potential goals by incorrect offside calls. At the end of the day, they played with 10 men for 70 out of the total 150 minutes, when Madrid themselves should've been down to 10 men and weren't. How big of an advantage is that? 11 v 10 for 70 minutes?   Even in extra time, they scored 2 offside goals eventually killing the tie. No one is denying the referee was complete utter shit for both the teams, but in such scenarios, whoever wins ultimately gained the advantage from it. At the end of the day, Bayern took Madrid to ET with 10 men and still had to be scored against illegally ( twice ) to be beaten. If we talk about yellows Casemiro had that howler of a game where he deserved like 4 Casemiro should have been off in the first half. Also penatly for Bayern for Marcelo handball in the first half.   Also offside call when Lewandowksi was 1v1 with the keeper, which turned out to be not offside at all.   The whole football world remembers this game as a robbery, but on reddit the true experts know how it really went down. Wanna really play this game? Cuntsemiro still being on the pitch? Lewandowski 1v1 ""offside"". There have been significantly more crucial decisions RM`s way, thats not a debate thats facts. Both Casemiro and Vidal should've been sent off but only one was and Madrid played 11v10 for 70 out of 150 minutes and still needed 2 offside goals in ET to win it. And before you reply with bayerns offside goal, please try to remember bayern getting wrongfully called offside when through on goal 1v1 against the keeper too. hahahah have you any shame to talk about red catds in that game after Casemiro got away with at least 4 Thank you for being a voice of reason, I feel like ive been in the twilight zone reading all the comments about the situation. And I hoped for a Bayern Munich win. Rüdiger isn't getting the ball regardless. The whistle only goes as Müller heads the ball. An argument can be made that Militao relaxes a bit, but again it doesn't look like he'd be able to do anything other than attempt to block the shot, which he still somewhat tries to do.  Nobody is saying it was a guaranteed goal, but there is a very good chance it still would have resulted in one. [Watch it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1cnf94u/bayern_munich_disallowed_goal_against_real_madrid/)  He whistles before the ball even gets to Müller. Yeah and then more time was wasted every time the ball went out of play. Ref was only okay today but he definitely did a good job keeping time. Happy to explain the game to a newly American Real fan, pal! ""Less than 0,1% of players can do a match official's job.""  The match officials can barely do their own job, mate. There is literally no pressure on the linesman in that instance lol. He's backed up by big brother VAR if he leaves the flag down and VAR will call it offside or not.  Make it less obvious that you're a ref and felt offended. [deleted] The whistle is the whistle. The whistle shouldn't have been blown because the rules and guidelines state so. That's the whole point. DeLigt offside is passive. Yea sure, the lino saw that, makes perfect sense. Ffs offsides are already semi automated, this is just plain incompetence from the lino nd ref Oxford Dictionary  noun: **accountability**  1. the fact or condition of being [accountable](https://www.google.com/search?sa=X&sca_esv=c039891655a7704c&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1GCEU_enES1059ES1059&biw=1920&bih=945&sxsrf=ADLYWIJN_S6KW4ZxMvFL2IZQ6g5Q4YOnNQ:1715243914322&q=accountable&si=ACC90nwKPQWKXvO0LWGU61hOTgoDSdN_chH6hhxj_50-lS5ApfODtwu1V45AnEGtV9B1YoUKVkdl-LOjHB1-2md9W-SFBEUI8sJt8f9tyJE3-X6OxFgYfRw%3D&expnd=1&ved=2ahUKEwjJjN3BlYCGAxVIfKQEHQ6LD7IQyecJegQIJhAO); responsibility.""lack of accountability has corroded public respect for business and political leaders""  This is exactly what the definition implies. In good companies, no one is punished at work for mistakes, but they are held accountable—the more responsibility, the greater the pay and the greater the accountability.  Why shouldn't match officials be held accountable at the level of a CL Semi-final? Sure, I also understand the perception that referees can do whatever they want and they are not held accountable.   Let's say a referee makes a bunch of mistakes in a season, and he's still there next week. Again, presumably it's because there are no better options to replace him, but I would like to know how they reached that conclusion. Just come out and say it, look, they've made this amount of mistakes but any potential replacement from a lower level has made more, this is the best we've got.   As a viewer and I am sure that it's the same as a player or manager it's a hard pill to swallow when you see the same people making mistakes, ruining games and then nobody can tell you why they're still refereeing. Just be transparent, I will accept ""shit"" referees still being around if I could have even the slightest confidence that there are no better options. But it's all silence and the decisions are starting to ruin enjoyment of games even for neutrals. Also, what is the incentive for referees to do a good job? If you can shit the bed constantly and nothing happens, you start ending up with an ego. Okay, maybe we don't hit them with the stick, let's try the carrot then, you don't fuck up, you get more money.  That refereeing pundit I've seen discuss this said the sanction is ""reconsidering them for further assignments"" that is some vague ass bullshit, if you've been burnt by some mistake, that is absolutely no comfort at all because it doesn't mean anything, it could very well be ""We've thought about it and it's fine, he can keep going"" If this is a ""top"" lineman and he raises his flag the moment he sees a possible centimetre offiside decision im not impressed. You could find 50 people of the street in 5 minutes who could do better because all they would need to do is nothing to literally be better. No. I think people always want to remove credit for the mentality the team has to no give up, it’s a skill. Playing at the Bernabéu is a plus as you get the push, but Madrid in the champions league is like Cristiano Ronaldo in the champions league (heh), the players truly believe that they can win every game.   There’s always ways to remove credit, “VARdrid, referees in the pocket of Flo” the reality is that Madrid is the best team in the world consistently when it comes to Champions league. The play went on ,it was reviewed and was given. Whereas Bayern was flagged, the play stopped and nothing was reviewed. Do you see the difference? Main ref doesn't have the angle so he trusted the lineman. He can't even be sure/unsure from that angle No, especially not in such an area. The defending side have a legitimate case against the influence of an observable raised flag. Referee is obligated to whistle once that linesman flagged. It would be messier than it already is in current form. Being held accountable is not punishment.  Yeah true. Yeah that’s true. [deleted] At least where i live, near Maastricht they can. Interference with play has an actual definition though.  Make an attempt to play the ball, physically prevent an opponent from playing the ball or block the goalkeeper's vision. Being robbed of a big chance in the last minute still is being robbed. And even if ""being robbed"" refers to the result of the match, then to say they weren't robbed is just as wrong as to say they were But Bayern didn’t and as a result Madrid dominated them in every conceivable way. You can’t say you watched that and didn’t think Madrid were easily the better team lol Tbf with the mounting injuries I don´t blame Bayern for that particular style today. Still fought valiantly albeit outclassed. Hala being an objective football fan Bayern also had Vidal on the pitch for a lot longer than he should have. Casemiro was nowhere near comparable to Vidal who committed enough fouls for 5 Yellows by the end of the game. In the first leg of that tie Bayern also got a pen when the ball hit carvajal’s shoulder not arm Ohhh yes and the ref also gave Bayern an absolutely bogus penalty in the first game for a non-existent handball on Carvajal. And failed to send off Vidal in the second half for absolutely bodying Casemiro while already on a yellow. And Madrid still destroyed Bayern 6-3 on aggregate  You see how we can go back and fourth? But not before Vidal. And you guys also scored an offside goal in the first leg didn't you? That tie is always mentioned, but I remember watching it and thinking that Bayern were very lucky with the ref. Only in the absolute end it was turned around and everybody only talked about Ronaldo's offside goal. But it was a well deserved tie imo, and Bayern wouldn't be in the position to compete if the ref's decision up to that point hadn't helped them. Reddit knows! What a shitshow that tie was. What’s your opinion on the penalty from the first leg? The vidal pen tho. More impactful then 1v1 vs the keeper imo It goes before Müller heads the ball. Even if neither Militao or Rüdiger could get the ball, I am fairly certain both of them would have essentially thrown themselves attempting to block it, but neither really put anything in it because they heard the whistle. Hell, look at Mendy and see how long before the goal is scored he just casually walks forward because of the whistle.  Considering the link on Reddit says ""Bayern München disallowed goal"" plenty of people are saying it would have been a guaranteed goal. Fair enough, my memory was wrong about the whistle. Still no defender stops though. Lunin does but no one knows if he have saved it or not. All we know is that the linesman wrongly put his flag up Not American, but would love to participate in laughing at them. Linesmen would still have a job, but it wouldn't involve flagging for offside.  Lines are drawn for the sake of refs and viewers, a computer does not need to render a line or any kind of image at all. It gets the coordinate data for all players from multiple Hawk-eye and broadcast cameras. This is not difficult to automate and is in many ways easier than tracking the ball since players move at a much slower speed, especially for obvious calls where a margin of 0.3m (or however little or much you want) is set and anything below that triggers a VAR check if a goal is scored. [deleted] It doesn't describe how they are held accountable? He can use his judgement though, he doesn't have to whistle (which is why they sometimes ignore the flag). That time of the game, that movement and with what is at stake, a referee selected for that occasion should be able to make that decision.  That is why he must not whistle Teams know the new rules, they know that the instruction are to play to the whistle as the MO is to play on as it'll be checked afterwards.  True, Germans speak mostly German, even if they go on vacation. In italy where tourist come specialy in north italy in the horeca sector italians speak German. Even the menus are in German. Lol Running at the direction of the ball in an offside position draws the defender in and is thus an attempt to play the ball. You do realise it actually was offside? Casemiro himself deserved 3-4 yellows. Sure Vidal was shit. Do you give out cards relatively to whoever was worse? Both should've been gone and only one was sent off. Madrid played 11v10 for 70 of the 150 minutes and still needed offside goals in ET to win. I do see how we can go back and forth, which is my entire point. In the end one team benefitted more from the shit refereeing. Bit rich to claim you destroyed us after needing 2 offside goals in ET while 11v10 but whatever floats your boat buddy. Why did Casemiro get to be on the pitch when ET started at all is also a mystery, should've been off just like Vidal. Not a pen, but Vidal also missed. 2 1v1s*. Yes. It goes milliseconds before Müller heads the ball. Yes, they might have acted differently had the whistle not gone, but they didn't obviously give up either. They were limited in what they could do anyway given their positions.  Fair enough about the other thread's title. I'm not arguing that it would have been a guaranteed goal, but just that it had a good chance of resulting in one. What is this gaslighting? Nacho doesn't attempt at the ball at all and Militao stops and does 0 reaction, like wth.  Edit:word. >All we know is that the linesman wrongly put his flag up  For someone who incorrectly described the video in like four ways, that is all you know. Honestly think goalkeepers at that level should save that shot 9/10. Had the finish been harder or closer to the post then I would agree that there is a good chance it would have been a goal. But you should expect a goalkeeper at this level to save a finish like that. Then British or Indian or whatever. Definitely not Spanish [deleted] You obviously don't know the rules.  If active/passive offside was judged the way you do it every single freekick from outfield into the box would be offside since the ball travels for 3/4 of the way before its clear who goes for it and yet thats exactly how its done by teams and the goals stand. I am saying there should be visible accountability for referees for errors like these. Are you asking me what exactly that should be? It's a bit unfair to answer on a message board without having had time for testing and focus groups. I'll give you a shot at answering it, but if you respond to this, before you critique it, can outline first if you think there should be visible accountability for officals?  I would be for officials giving rationale accounts of why they took the decision they took and then indicating if they felt they were correct or not. They don't need to do this in front of the press, but the clubs should be able to request this account after the game for certain instances (details on amount, medium and reflection time to be ironed out).  I also think that if there is a decision behind a closed door that these refs are excluded from the final, there should be transparency on this. Carragher said last night, ""They probably lost their chance at the final with that decision."" I think it's good for UEFA/FIFA and whoever else to publicise these decisions. Without transparency, there's frustration and anger—clubs who have lost a chance at significant silverware should be able to see a clear reaction to that.  That's what accountability is. The player doesn't train well or misses two penalties; they come to get dropped, or a new pen taker is appointed. If the manager screams at the ref or says something inappropriate after the game, they get a yellow or a fine. They all have a responsibility and a shared level of accountability to go with it. Officials have a considerable responsibility, and they should be attributed to appropriate accountability to go with it. That's a much tougher call for the official than the linesman. The linesman I have absolutely no idea what the fuck he's doing, but the ref I can at least understand trusting his guy to raise the flag in an obvious situation.  Shitty though it is it's also true that players stopped playing once the whistle is blown and who knows what would have happened. Trying to pretend it was a sure goal if not for the fuck ups isn't accurate* either.  But Bayern were definitely denied the chance to equalize. What's the use of lineman then? Then remove lineman ref from the game It's not though. You can't make up rules.  It's just a bad decision. Even the linesman apologised for the mistake How can you be so sure? Vidal was significantly worse. Seeing how many fouls it ended up taking for Vidal to be finally sent off the ref was at least consistent with his line to not give Casemiro a 2nd yellow since he didnt do as much as Vidal. Game was never even going to ET without the Lewandowski offside goal lol. Bayern got so lucky there him missing is irrelevant when talking about the referee decisions favouring one team over the other though (that the other user was suggesting) Four ways? Name them Even worse, friend. An Arab. Yes, currently the cameras for the semi-automated offside are tracking 29 points on the body of each player and extrapolating from that. A nice visual explanation is here if you're interested:   https://inside.fifa.com/technical/football-technology/football-technologies-and-innovations-at-the-fifa-world-cup-2022/semi-automated-offside-technology [deleted] I would assume they do already review those decisions and also as I understand the referee explicitly admitted he was wrong and apologised to de Ligt in this situation.    In this case it's clear the referee understands he made the wrong decision and he probably feels a lot of shame for it. He will also probably fall out of favour on picks in some more important games in the future compared to other refs.    So your suggestion is to just add more transparency to that? So that there would be clear ruling that is communicated to public? Or what should exactly be done in terms of more accountability in this situation?   You were saying ""no punishment"", but keeping them away from more important games is punishment.   Do you think there should be some sort of public ""mistakes"" score for referees? E.g. they get awarded public penalty points for each missed decision and then for most important games the refs with least mistakes would be picked? I am not saying I would be against that. It could be interesting, I'm not sure how it would exactly affect the game or what the impact on decisions would be.   I suppose this could even be implemented by public itself. Public keeping track of errors by refs, published on a website.   What I'm afraid of is that ultimately we are all human, and we make mistakes, so even if we do this accountability system, this was clearly a spur of the moment error from nerves on the ref. Would the accountability system increase or decrease the nerves that were likely to lead to this error?   Because here linesman clearly apologizes, admits they fucked up, but obviously it won't undo all of that for Bayern Munich, so people will be left unsatisfied no matter what. It wouldn't even be enough to axe the hand that brought up the flag of the linesman, it's not going to win Bayern the CL. How is it tough, knowing, as a ref, that VAR would be there to check if they score, or even if they didn’t? It’s not tough to wait on a whistle knowing there are checks for exactly that To flag incidences that the ref might have missed. But with var, goal line and offside tech, they should have a reduced role.  You understand nothing about soccer , logic, and rules. Because I have eyes and know the rules. Don't agree. Casemiro had no business at all being on the pitch, regardless of Vidal. You're biased into believing one was worse, I'm not even arguing for Vidal, I know both of them deserved it. At the end of the day, one team benefitted from it. Yeah it shouldn't have gone to ET because bayern would've scored the 2 1v1s against the keeper the ref wrongfully called offside. Only one team got lucky Why is it irrelevant he missed? Ref made a mistake, but that didn't influence the game. The same cannot be said about Ramos' own goal, Casemiro not being sent off and Ronaldo's goals. (Maybe I missed more mistakes, I don't remember the game that well anymore) Whistle timing, all the defenders. Cheers! No it isnt for the purpose of the offside rule. There is no freekick exception to the offside rule. >You were saying ""no punishment"", but keeping them away from more important games is punishment.  It's not punishment, though; it's transparency and accountability. If Carragher is saying that they are not going to ref the final as a result, but it's behind closed doors, then why not make it transparent and public?   >Do you think there should be some sort of public ""mistakes"" score for referees? E.g. they get awarded public penalty points for each missed decision and then for most important games the refs with least mistakes would be picked? I am not saying I would be against that. It could be interesting, I'm not sure how it would exactly affect the game or what the impact on decisions would be.  I don't think they are something as granular as that (but I wouldn't be against it). For things to improve, in anything, you need three things - clear accountability, transparency and measurability.   Why is this referee picked over this other one? How are we measuring the performance of referees? And what is the process when errors are made? These are all legitimate questions that all of us have to answer in our roles if we want improvement.   >I suppose this could even be implemented by public itself. Public keeping track of errors by refs, published on a website.  It's not official, though - it's a hobby and is ignorable. Those running it should have it. By having no transparency, accountability and measurability, the stakeholders, in this case, clubs, players, managers, fans, etc., lose faith in the system as they can't understand its workings.   And it's not novel - Tuchel can't come out and say the referee is a donkey and should never ref again. As a manager, he is responsible for representing his club, the spirit of the game and good behaviour. If he does say that, he'll be held accountable because he's not fulfilling his duties in accordance with his responsibilities.   As a manager of Bayern, he's already been held accountable for his time in the league - he was **responsible** for Bayern's campaign this year, his performance was **measured** against peers and previous years, and now he is **accountable** for poor performance.   Every part of football operates like this because it's trying to improve, why would officiating be immune to it?  >What I'm afraid of is that ultimately we are all human, and we make mistakes, so even if we do this accountability system, this was clearly a spur of the moment error from nerves on the ref. Would the accountability system increase or decrease the nerves that were likely to lead to this error?  Then we can work on helping the referees in these scenarios - but to avoid the whole approach in isolation from the rest of the sport makes no sense. It's saying things are good enough and these mistakes are fine.   >Because here linesman clearly apologizes, admits they fucked up, but obviously it won't undo all of that for Bayern Munich, so people will be left unsatisfied no matter what. It wouldn't even be enough to axe the hand that brought up the flag of the linesman, it's not going to win Bayern the CL.  Apologising to De Ligt is not a transparent acknowledgement of the error and what it means. And it's not about apologising to players - it's about reflection, transparency and accountability. Apologising is separate from this. If they play on in a situation that's obviously offside and a player gets injured the ref would also be crucified for allowing play to continue when the linesman had flagged it. The referee has to be able to trust his linesman to raise the flag on obvious offsides for player safety he doesn't have the angle and has other elements of play to focus on. I don't think pinning any blame on the referee is fair in this situation. Lol I guess Bayern didnt benefit from not being down to 10 man in the first half I guess We can go back and forth. Till this day I’m not even sure Casemiro made contact with Robben on that penalty but ohh well  Fact of this matter is that Bayern got a free offside goal, one bogus penalty in the first game, Vidal got away without being sent off for bodying Casemiro and they lost 6-3 on aggregate AND STILL CRY lol Holy fuck you are getting destroyed and keep yapping the narrative from others when it comes to those referee decisions that went against us is that they were just mistakes, but somehow the ones that favoured us were part of an agenda and that’s just dishonest. i agree that the mistakes overall benefited us however…and if the tie ended bc of our own goal i would feel how you feel So two things then? [deleted] So you just put it on the linesman himself because of a very specific example you’ve decided to conjure? “Only” Trusting your linesman is how mistakes are made as a lead ref, we have VAR for a reason. ""Lol"" https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/86F5jRXJR8 Not as much as Madrid did for not being downt to 10 at all for the entire 150, getting to play 11v10 in the entire ET when it should've been 10v10, and then scoring 2 offside goals after that, and also getting their asses saved by the ref twice by Muller and Lewandoski being called wrongfully offside when 1v1 with your keeper.   Yes you guessed correct. There were more than one defender lol  But yes, you're wrong in every way that matters, wonderful argument. What does that have to do with whether he was offside or not? The offside is passive. The rules are no different from open play vs a freekick. Sorry you fail to see any nuance in the situation. 2 offside goals only happen because the referee allowed Bayern to make it to extra time with a soft pen and an offside goal. I’m wrong in saying the linesman shouldn’t have put his flag up? [deleted] As a (very very small league) referee, we’re trained not to.  As I hope, they are First of all, the soft pen didn't even result in a goal, so how did that help bayern get to ET? Did you even watch the match. And then secondly, the ref stopped 2 potential bayern goals from being scored by giving wrong offside calls too. You understand that? He gave them a goal by missing an offside, yes, but he took away potentially 2 by calling bayern offside when they weren't, both times from 1v1 against the keeper positions. Is it that hard to grasp ? That's the only correct thing you said Thats not the point of this debate. Stop moving the goalposts. Cheers! [deleted] You are a fucking idiot boy."
"[Official] We are delighted to announce the signing of Matthijs de Ligt from Bayern Munich","2024-08-13T19:10:39+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ergdpd/official_we_are_delighted_to_announce_the_signing/","[No textual content]","4103","TrenAt14","https://twitter.com/ManUtd/status/1823436887677153398","In the summer of 2022 Bayern signed De Ligt, Mazraoui, Gravenberch, Mané and Tel. 2 years later, only Tel remains, disappointing how things turned for what was an exciting window.  Good luck in England Mathijs and happy belated birthday. Matta x Licha when Operation 'assembling Ajax' continues I'm gonna miss him so much. I was heartbroken when he joined Juve instead of Bayern a few years ago and it was like a dream coming true when he joined us 2 years ago. It's a shame it ended this way as I was convinced he'd become a Bayern legend. May he finds success wherever he goes. Enjoy him United fans. Bad Day. We have some fucking clowns at decision making. Instead of building up on our best defender, we got rid of him cause of  wages. Even though half of the squad is on high wages and does not perform well. Great fucking idea. INEOS absolutely locked in on transfers this summer holy shit Holy shit, United are cooking this summer Looking forward to this. Will be sad not to see Johnny Evans every week even if he's past his best because everybody else is injured tho. Sad day as a Bayern fan, this transfer window has been a total let down. For the last 2 years I've been scratching my head why Upamecano is the starter and when they wanted to sell a player they chose to sell a far better defender than Upa. i really hate this direction the football is taking, where a defender is judge more on the ability on the ball than the actual defending. Not that Upa has been that reliable on the ball either, he makes plenty of stupid passes. I'll miss De ligt. Amazing sign in, the defense with Licha and De Ligt is formidable Missed opportunity to say “we are de ligted” I am heartbroken, devastated, depressed, dissapointed and feeling empty af. Our board gets a big F U from me for letting him go. Damn this hurts, especially reading his farewell message. Just seems like he didn‘t want to move so quick either. All the very best de Ligt and hopefully united have a good season ahead Afternoon de Ligt. Still can't believe bayern forced him out.. man u got a steal Okay INEOS can we now have 1 new Nice signing, ideally another midfielder and a Todibo replacement 🫶🏼🫶🏼 Having Licha and Matta as your cb's is a world class defense for any team.  You're going to love this one Manchester United fans, sincerely an Ajax fan. delighted, nice Possibly contender for best CB in the world under nagelsmann.  Sold at a loss 2 years later  Just bayern things For some reason I feel the same way for when Kroos and Schweinsteiger left. This one really hurts, we did him dirty. Love the fact the trefoil is back Please can someone bring back that soccer court post of the guy who pretended to be an itk. I think even the united fans can chuckle about it now that they have him I seriously, seriously don't understand why München was so hell-bent on getting rid of not only a promising player, but one who wanted to remain and prove himself.  If I was in de Ligt's shoes, I would probably treat Bayern with utter contempt from now on. I'm looking forward to watching Ajax United this season. *Cries in Bayern* United has gone down to the shitters. Come on, how can you not say ""We are deLigted to announce...."" There We Land Where are Daley Blind and Lasse Schone? Missed opportunity to say deligted Despaaaacito time. Very nice. Time for a DM/CM Time will tell on this one. He looked a world-beater at Ajax, but I think even he himself would admit those stints at Juve and Bayen haven't exactly proven fruitful. Safe gamble for United and a good deal on paper, but I wouldn't say it is a guaranteed success. After years of Eric Dier being linked with Man United instead he goes to Bayern and takes de Ligt's job; sending him to Manchester. As soon as the Julian Alvarez to Atletico rumor started, I had this feeling that Manu could pull a miracle. City will be uninspired, Arsenal fatigued, Liverpool just lost Klopp and Tottenham is Tottenham.   Easy 50 bucks on Manu to win since it's barely enough for one takeout dinner with an appetizer anyway. De Ligt ed Jonny Evans > M. de Ligt Odds on getting injured the next 3 days ? so reassembleing 2018 Ajax? Just more injury prone? For the first few minutes the link in their tweet went nowhere because they hadn’t published the announcement article yet. Great planning lol Glorified journeyman he keep falling upwards... wait a second Can't wait for another season of United fans crying about how Ten Hag needs more signings/support when they lose to Crystal Palace I don't think De Ligt is elite, but this is a very good signing for them.  He immediately improves their back line depth and has to be worth 3-6 points over a season compared to someone like Evans.  That puts United much closer to a European spot. Well, there goes another career down the shitter at ManUtd. I get that this hurts because he’s a fan favorite, but a lot of Bayern fans have to show more faith in our board. Besides the Kroos mistake we have been excellent at identifying who we should sell/let go over the last 10-15 years Do we know his wage at all? He might be the first player in forever to of taken a wage cut to join. Must be decent if Juve and Bayern let him go. United have now spent £600M under ten hag surely a title challenge is a must now . Anything less than top 4 is a failure Let's be real, they signed to play with the GOAT Antony And which parts of the scouting and club staff remain from that window lmao I never understood why Bayern wanted to go for Mane. He's not an out and out striker to replace Lewandowski's goals. He had a few games as a ST but he was mainly a winger. He moved from right wing to left after Salah joined Liverpool  Man United 🤝 Bayern. Thanks for the reinforcements guys, I for one have wanted De Ligt forever. Only time can Tel Cheers mate, it’s been a good birthday so far. Mané being a Pedophile did not help things ontop of that I'd imagine. Nor does it make me feel better about 2019. Gah I'm still bitter. What does Tel’s future look like? He seems a really exciting player! At least you kept the best one That's crazy. Just 2 years ago Did a Mane-Kane-Sane front three ever happen or did Mane leave before Kane came? I absolutely forgot he was on Bayern lol [deleted] Friday hopefully 🤞 Almost certainly Friday x Maz x Onana. Any special Ajax fullbacks or so we can complete the backline like Exodia? Otherwise we’d just have to play Antony at LB and Eriksen in midfield DeLicha combo just dropped. Did they ever play together or will this be the first time? Schone where you at babygirl Their number 6 looked handy in that CL run. Should see what he's at these days... Tagliafico being called as we speak Can United still cancel that Donny van de Beek deal with Girona? Bring back the Ajax ‘18-‘19 gang! Hey maybe Tadic even has one more magic season in him? Let’s call Fenerbaçe! Would be really funny if they all play terribly together and then Donny Van De Beek has a late career resurgence at Girona. Operation assembling the confederation of the Rhine to attack Austria is going poorly for me rn. I hope it goes better for United. I want General Mack's army encircled dammit I know people are taking the piss but the types of players we've needed are technically secure footballers. Ajax (and Barca) are famous for producing this style of player. We've been playing with people like AWB, McTominay, Maguire, and De Gea, who I love each and every one of, but are weak in possession and passing the football. Our new signing are all of a much more technical archetype. It makes sense that so many of these players are coming from Ajax Younger Tadic could’ve been great for United. United to the Eredivisie confirmed? Why's he leaving? I was under the impression he was good for Bayern and was happy there.   I'm not following player or the club so I'm probably missing something, care to explain? Thanks 🙏🏻 The fact that youve struggled to offload is really hurting you tbh. Seems like all of Gnabry, Goretzka, Coman and such are willing to just chill on fat contracts on the bench rather than move.   Add struggling to get 1st, 2nd, 3rd or even 4th choice manager and losing out on targets like Simons and Doué so publically and Im sure it'll raise some tensions from Hoeness etc. Will be interesting to see how things develop. You may not like to hear it, but DeLigt was overpaid. The fact that other player are also doesnt negate that. And sadly DeLigt was the only one with a real market, thats why he was sold Previous management fucked up the wage structure and new management is now doing their best to reestablish it. Zirkzee, Yoro, De Ligt and Mazraoui, with at least another midfielder to come. Really couldn't have hoped for a better window. Proof will be in the pudding Very annoying to see United being well run. Doesn't help I'm living in Boehly world. 12 months ago we would still be ""monitoring"" and ""expressing interest"" in Zirkzee, while spending the entire transfer window to try and get him bellow release clause.   Then in the last day, since we focused only on one player, our wankers and bankers would offer Varane a 3+1 contract, because we didn't reinforce anything else and we were desperate. It's still Ten haag and united, they gonna continue being shit. [deleted] GEKOLONISEERD Empirically, 19/20 United signings become worse the instant they sign. It's onto them to finally unleash the potential of their squad Buying another injury-prone big name on outlandish wages—what could possibly go wrong? I mean.... don't be so sure about it. We will see case x evans at some point im sure of it Maldini himself would be trembling at the thought of dislodging Evans, especially as he’s only now really entering his prime (full disclosure I am a big Johnny Evans fan) That’s rather presumptuous of you, Pete He's ill apparently. But who knows, with our luck we might see him play Honestly past his best or not he only had maybe 2 bad games last season off the top of my head? He was surprisingly solid for us even if it caused issues with our system. > Will be sad not to see Jonny Evans every week even if he’s past his best because everyone else is injured though   Ah you sweet summer child [deleted] How has Martinez been actually? We are delicked? Mazzzzraoui on the right…afternoon de liiigtttt Scott McTominay & Victor Lindelof to Nice for 90m combined incoming. Can I interest you in one antony And I think if we ever go to for three at the back, Yoro, Martinez and MDL is something really nice. All three are very comfortable on the ball, all three can hold a high line and all three can put in serious tackles when required. Dalot and Shaw are very good at going foward as well, which in theory should give Rashford/Garnacho/Amad loads of opportunities to attack. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/s/ACxCujohPW) is the link to the thread if you’re interested. It’s funny to see how many people from 5 years ago are still active from that period Spoofex has popped up in the r/reddevils sub don't you worry 😂 Spoofex, the mods of r/reddevils invited him to post the announcement from ornstein the other day, he didn’t see it until later but then he made a post.  And he didn’t pretend, say what you want about the guy but he did have a source it just deteriorated Had a different manager every season of his career, not surprised he's stalled [removed] There is an interview with ESPN when he came to Bayern where he felt like at Juve he had to defend very differently to what he was used to and that he felt Nagelsmann would fit him well. He was right, his best ever season was under Nagelsmann. I'm sure ETH can use him to the best of his abilities. There is so much objectively false info about de Ligt in the media. I heard gab marcotti and atleast one other journalist say he was benched by Dier last season. De Ligt was paired with Dier almost every game that Dier played last season so obviously that’s impossible. Can’t wait for media to start talking about his turn around at United as if his level was trash before. Hope EtH can bring him to the next level Its only a ""safe gamble"" if he actually took a real paycut, like down to 150-170k range. De Ligt hasn't played well consistently enough in his career so far to earn 200k and above IMO. That's the real reason Bayern are binning him. If he was on 150k or less, they would have kept him. Unite have ten hag though Palace is a trap. We ALL know this. Me when I lie Hasn't really been reported by anyone except 1 German source saying he's willing to take a cut. Nothing from English sources yet. Sure it'll be leaked after his first bad game There's rounding up and then there's adding £80m to what we've actually spent Even INEOS haven't set Ten Hag a target. That Scouse maths? 🤣🤣 The higher-ups in management are gone, idk about staff. The technical director, chief scout and sporting director are all gone I think profiling has been a problem at Bayern for a while now, and still is based on who they were pursuing this summer To be fair in his last season, until Christmas playing left wing he was awful. Klopp moved him through the middle when Diaz joined and he had a great second half of the season. He was already finished as a wide player when he left. But still a strange choice to replace Lewandwoski I have a big feeling that we'll see him reunited with De Jong again sometime in their careers, I could see it being United. +1 Matthis be De Ligt time.  (i tried) Tbf Mané was definitely the least exciting of the bunch, he was old and he was brought in to play as false 9,so the Lewa replacement, and many people weren't convinced and it turned out they were right. The whole thing about him being a pedo came out after he already left for Saudi right? They even made a profit on him in transfer fees I nearly forgot about that, on top of the weird narrative that ""oh this is how things are in Africa"" that some people had in here.   As a native African, no this isnt normal. And he had such a good reputation prior to that too. What a trip. Mane a pedo? What have I missed? Sadio Mane? Wait what. Didn’t he marry some 18 year old or something Kissinger was honoured and mourned by this club and Germans are overwhelmingly supporting a genocide, don't think they care much about morality.   Edit: what an expected outcome. Maybe I should have just stuck to criticizing, ME countries and China. You westerners are nothing but hypocrites. Yeah and he's on a long contract, hopefully he gets more minutes this season, he's looked good whenever he was given the chance. Well, we have a great record with keeping our players healthy...Yikes we'll probably play Martinez at left back, and then have De ligt and Maguire at centerback and dalot at right back. But I hope Mazraoui plays left back instead but I just have a gut feeling he won't right away ETH doesnt have a track record of throwing new signings right in the mix, but we'll see 🤞 Just go buy tagliafico, he's the one missing lol. Tagliafico In terms of a “Ten Hag Links XI” we’re getting close:   Onana   Mazraoui - de Ligt - Martinez - Malacia  Eriksen - CM  Antony - Mount - LW  Zirkzee Bring back Blind. United should seriously buy Tagliafico. That guy is a warrior and will never disappoint. Nope, Mathijs left in summer 2019, Licha joined in summer 2019. It's time for Dolberg to finally achieve his FM wonder kid potential🥲 Probably calling Laporta: [Where is my money man?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjX1ITzuJ_k) Well at the very least you can be sure he will give it his all. Davinson Sanchez return to PL when? Wouldn't be a bad backup All jokes aside its actually crazy how badly things worked out for him since joining United. First Ole was manager and didn't want to play him. Which ok, it can happen. But then an ex Ajax manager joins, who seems to have a fetish for only signing ex Ajax players... and then Donny still doesn't get any minutes!  Would be even funnier if he was the missing piece for Ajchester United to gel perfectly together. Everyone hopes DVB does well elsewhere, rotten luck, political signing and that’s before he was never a player for the PL. Bayern have been making lots of dumb decisions over the last few years It seems to be a mix of him having high wages while also not fitting in the player profile they are looking for in CB under Kompany (being able to pass better, plus a bit quicker), ±injury issues.  For me it feels like a short-sighted decision.  There are other players who got big contracts at the same time who didn't get shoved out the door. Müller is soon retiring (big wages off the books), and the club has a wave/revenue ratio in the low 50% (as far as I remember) and a healthy club should be somewhere in the high 50s to low 60s. Being persnickety about ""high wages"" with this background feels like they were just looking for an excuse.  In short (about that 50+% ratio): it implies the club is getting transfers into the club that have a player value fitting their revenue. If you are higher than the mid 60s (or even in your 70s) you end up with issues of potentially lacking funding for future transfers (bad for the future) and if you are too low then you are not aiming to sustain your revenue and level of play with the quality of players you are getting (being unnecessary frugal and potential bad for success and thus also revenue).  His injury issues also seem a bit overblown. He got rushed back during a time when Bayern was lacking players and promptly got injured. I wouldn't assume that he'd get injured at the same rate going forward. Bayern also has had quite a few players who they kept for a long time despite demonstrable injury issues.  And it's not as if he couldn't still improve his passing. He's in his early 20s, not late 30s and close to retirement. He's also a good defender and has good positioning to help him with that. Some of his defensive issues also showed up when Bayern as a whole was having issues defending. If you don't have a midfield that can protect the defence a bit, your weak press is bypassed easily, and your whole team misplaces passes then you can't just blame defender and the keeper for not doing their job.   He seems passionate about the club and it felt to me like he would be able to grow into a leader and future captain. I'm just a bit sad about the whole situation :( His performances didn't justify his high wages and they're trying to reduce the wage bill. He was an easy one to let go. Bayern* had to sell someone to ease their wage budget. He's the only good player, in other words sellable, with high wages.  * Accidentally wrote Juve, meant Bayern. Although it also applies to his exit from Juve. Eberl is at the wheel. also, he's not your best defender and only three of them have Dutch affiliations! we’re getting better! Getting rid of Greenwood is still the highlight for me I kinda hope that somehow FDJ goes to united now. Finances and Barcelona bullshit aside it’d be cool to see De Jong and De Ligt playing together again. Pls Ugarte and not Berge wait weren’t milan rumored with Zirkzee? And striker We have had so many summer windows where people have said this just before the season starts. Let's wait and see how it turns out before we start talking about being well run. >Boehly world  Life in plastic is fantastic? *Eghbali I assure you, if there's a team that can turn him into shit, it's United. Dont know if it counts as being well run just buying loads of players. Agree on top 4 as a goal this season, but idk about striking distance to the title. However, I want to see a more dominant play style against the mid table teams and at least equal footing against the top teams. The results might not be on our side, but play style matters more to me. Don't be too hasty. We already have 3 key players out lol. Hope the injury bug stops here Striking distance to the title is like 85+ points. That’s an unreasonable expectation, although possible Top4 at least has always been the goal since Moyes time. This is no different there are some strong teams, top 4 will be a blood bath  City, Arsenal, Liverpool, United, Villa, Newcastle, Tottenham all vying for it, Chelsea have an outside chance too They were interviewing other candidates recently and his job was up in the air. He'll be sacked if they don't get top 4. It should’ve been top 4 regardless of all these signings since it’s his third year De Ligt is less injury prone than Stones is mate. He agreed to a wage reduction  Probably in midfield. 😂 Everybody should be a big Johnny Evans fan! So big a fan you misspelled his first name. Jonathan or Jonny is the name of the legend. That's understatement. How the hell does Upa get his fourth seasons here after the rhe horrific performances in the last 2 seasons... He is great, now that he is healthy I know you're joking but I'm just wondering if that would be allowed or prevented under the same restrictions as Todibo I would take McSauce for even just a loan. He has a player profile that is very similar to Thuram (in physicality only). I can't say I want Lindelof, would much prefer Danso from Haise coached Lens. 5 years ago. Jeez Yea that's actually incredible when you think about it. Having a different boss with a different way of doing things every year has got to be detrimental to your development and performance.  I remember when I first saw him live and he had a real presence at 18. He is very good, I think he will do well for you. He needs confidence and he needs time, which he didn't get at Bayern and Juventus. Oh yeah, I totally agree. It seems that Bayern fans really like him, too. I'm not sure if you've seen that Scholes interview (which is very over the top), but the core of his argument is valid, I think, in that De Ligt isn't exactly in the best moment of his career. United really needs stability, and it's a notoriously difficult club to play when things don't go well, so those early games will be important. De Ligt needs to hit the ground running. It's wild - Scholes and Souness were sounding off that he had shit seasons at Juve and Bayern and is a bench player - talk about demonstrating that you have no idea about your club. > De Ligt was paired with Dier almost every game that Dier played last season so obviously that’s impossible.  That's not completely true either to say he played in almost every game. Of the 15 games that Dier played in, De Ligt completely didn't play in 4 and played less than 45 minutes in 2 others. Most, certainly, but almost every is also a stretch. There is zero chance he's taken that big of a pay cut. He has literally no reason to do so. We hear this all the time with player transfers and it almost never turns out to be true. I'm pretty sure it was even rumoured when De Ligt joined Bayern, and then it turned out he was on €300k per week. Which player should we not have sold/let go besides Kroos in 2014? https://www.transfermarkt.us/erik-ten-hag/spielertransfers/trainer/3816/plus/0/galerie/0?station_id=368838 https://www.transfermarkt.us/erik-ten-hag/spielertransfers/trainer/3816/plus/0/galerie/0?station_id=368838 Why? We've been looking for a left footed center back and we got Ito, we've been looking for a CDM and we got Palhinha, we've had doubts about Gnabry and Sane's fitness and consistency so we got Olise (who can also play in the middle if Musiala gets played wide) was kinda surprised he dropped off so suddenly. I expected him to do well into his early 30s. He didn't seem to have lost a lot of pace. Honestly think bayern just wasn't the right club for him. I do wonder how he would've been if he joined Roma when Mourinho was in charge. Mourinho does like his players to track back and Mane was no slouch. Also, Roma had Dybala and Lukaku or Tammy Abraham there. Could've been a great attack Erik ten Hag moving heaven and earth to bring his boys back into the fold, so yeah, definitely can see him pushing upper management hard to get Frenkie at some point. He was 30, not exactly ancient. Realistically he was the most proven player out of the bunch at the time. if the offside rule didn't exist, Mane would've broken the Lewandowski record by Christmas That's hindsight though, him and De Ligt were definitely the ones people were most excited about The only exciting thing about Mané was the ""Sane, Mané, Kane"" meme. Mane was for sure the most exciting one. Your memory is wrong. Tbf he wasn't Bundesliga proven so it was a big risk coming from the prem yes, but he also punched Leroy Sane for some reason [deleted] He’s not a pedophile. A pedophile sexually abuses minors. He married an 18 year old, who was betrothed to him when she was 16 years old. He paid for her schooling and provided monetary support to her family but it is incredibly doubtful that he, as a vocal and devout Muslim man, was flying home to molest this devout Muslim girl.   Do I believe that this type of arranged marriage is outdated? Yes.   Would I be horrified to hear that a Western player did the same thing? Absolutely.   The age difference is weird and off putting but he’s not a pedophile. It did, but it really is annoying still. He married his longtime girlfriend after she turned 18 I think it’s more to do with him talking to her from when she was younger or something and waiting to get married until she was 18.  I could be wrong on the above so feel free to correct me. Ig u can say only time will Tel Maz had a full preseason. Higher chance he starts compared to MDL so likely Maz, Martinez, Maguire, Dalot At most for a game ten hag will want Martinez for his build up ability he is also too slow as a fb, dalot was already shown he can do an ok job at lb and has a lot more game time there then anyone at the club that's not a lb no point putting Martinez out there who can also do an ok job instead of a good to great one at cb Martinez didn't look comfortable at LB against City. I reckon Maz will play LB. Nobody else is available to play left back. Mazraoui will be straight in I reckon. MdL to come on late for Maguire. The only one I can think of is Antony Noo noo they need rensch for 25 million Or Daley Blind lol We already bought two duds, that's enough haha Donny 🥲 Amrabat could've been the other CM too Donny wore 6 in that team. Being a back-up to Bruno, who is a literal machine, means no major minutes. Plus his lengthy injury. Plus he played like Liam Miller (may he rest in peace) whenever he had the chance, didn’t help. ETH is many things but not a miracle worker. Yeah it baffles me also that his Ajax form completely famished once in Manchester. But let’s see what Donny can do in Spain. I always believed his style of play is better suited for La Liga. Even Daley Blind, who was in heavy decline at Ajax and didn’t play much in Munich, apparently found a second youth at Girona. So maybe that Mediterranean lifestyle will do wonders. And who knows where he ends up? A tandem with Mbappe? While Donny was still at Ajax there was heavy interest from Real Madrid… Don't forget Rangnick.  3 different coaches watched him in training and concluded he wasn't good enough. Donny van Deek? This is the sort of comment that ages horribly when a ‘look back’ thread in 2030 happens nd De Ligt suddenly turns into a permanently crocked CB that plays ten games a season.  I truly hope I’m wrong. Isn't he one of the best ball playing cb already? He is pretty much the only player, with very high wages, who actually had a market for selling him. Goretzka and Gnabry earn even more and possibly were higher on the list of players to sell. But I don’t believe any club really wants either one of them, especially if they’re not willing to accept much lower wages. According to another thread he was the best CB for Bayern for the 2 seasons he was there(acc to Bayern flairs as well) so I don't get where this is coming from. [deleted] Don’t forget Ruud and Rene as well. If Sancho goes too we MOSTLY dropped the luggage. I don’t think Case will go sadly Not this Euros but don't they play together for Holland He’s signed with United for about 3 weeks now Yeah, and you guys refused the agent fees, whereas we happily paid them. I personally think there's a strong chance we make a late move for Toney or similiar. Fingers crossed. Yeah the Ronaldo summer was crazy. So many people thought United would be going for the title after that.  ""Winning"" the transfer window seems to be a curse more often than not. Yeah we've had quite a few false dawns where we've signed  great players on paper and it's gone to shit. It feels a bit different this time though where the Glazers aren't running this side of things anymore. I mean if I can jinx it I will lol 100%. De Ligt in particular feels like a great signing but I'm still remembering how disappointing that Ronaldo transfer window was where everyone thought we'd be challenging for the league. I'm cautiously optimistic but I'm not going to be singing the owner's praises (or Ten Hags) until there's results Yeah getting the players is the first step. What are your expectations then?  This is his third year and there's been some heavy investment. If he fails to get CL it will be a disappointment, especially playing dreadful football like last season. Winning the league isn't a realistic option right now, but CL should be the goal, even moreso given they already achieved it. You mean Stones the six-time league winner? Prevented since they’re both in Europa no we cant sell due to owning both clubs and playing in europa but its fine for city to do it by buying a player for a french 2nd division team for a record fee loaning him to another team they own that qualify for the CL and i fully sure theres a 2 year agreement in place we wont buy anyone from Nice lol yes our fans are world renowned for their patience and ability to build up player confidence. This guy might be doomed. In context though that basically just Dier transfering in. Getting tried out in different ways and then eventually Tuchel stuck with him and de Ligt for like every game for the rest of the season where both could play. Then it isn't a ""safe gamble"". I have no idea what you are trying to convey here. But there have been reports saying INEOS havent set a Top4 target for TenHag. Doesn't matter if he spent a bazillion pounds. If the owners don't set a target, there is nothing really to aim for. Because of the pursuits of Doué and Simons, why get this kind of player that isn't an out and out winger, both like to roam in the area behind the striker and drift centrally, Musiala and Olise already do this, so why did they go after them? They are obviously very talented, but I don't think they are what Bayern need. he says ""for a while now"" and your only counter-argument is the current transfer window...feels like you are proving his point.  so asking why makes no sense at all in the context you have provided. Because of the pursuits of Doué and Simons, why get this kind of player that isn't an out and out winger, both like to roam in the area behind the striker and drift centrally, Musiala and Olise already do this, so why did they go after them? They are obviously very talented, but I don't think they are what Bayern need. Barca's always treated De Jong a little oddly too, so I could see him being easily convinced to move away. But he played in Klopp's Liverpool for 6 years. That's like 12 regular years. He was definitely slowing down a bit at that point, physically  He was definitely the most proven, but the fact that he was the Lewa replacement is what made people apprehensive I wasn't, so maybe my memory is wrong My memory is biased because I wasn't excited To be fair, the more I watch Sané play the more sympathetic I am to Mané. Maybe Sane called him a pedo too lol Didn't he accuse him off racism? [deleted] > vocal and devout Muslim man  Because someone being of strong faith is always a great sign of their character! You just described grooming (him holding the monetary power over her and her family) A pedophile is sexually attracted to children. Doesnt mean they actually have sex with them. Apparantly Mane was sexually attracted enough to her at 14 years old to want to marry her. So to some extent he is exhibiting some pedophile tendencies yes.  Going to Saudi made a lot of sense for him. There such behaviour is I guess socially acceptable. Yea that’s a pass from me dog. Super sus What?? How long were they together?? Christ I'm not saying it's any better, but wasn't more a case of an arranged marriage? Shawn’s not hurt so if he’s match fit after his vacation he should start.  Edit: apparently he is hurt. I thought they didn’t want to play him in the last game was he wasn’t match fit or didn’t want to risk him. They didn’t have on the injury list until today. He even scored against Arsenal. Time files He even scored against Arsenal. Time files I miss that beautiful bastard he left already At United, it's a story that happens far too often The fact that it was so easy to get him and no one else was fighting for him makes me feel a bit uneasy.  We'll see what happens I guess. Not sure. There were some complaints/interpretation of him lacking the type of passing range Bayern wants and not being too pressing resistant.  But for me the defensive performance of Bayern (including all CBs and keepers) over the last two years was overall rather wobbly and evaluating a player on that time alone doesn't feel like it paints the whole picture.   I also  think he was a really good fit and was a player for the next decade (at least). But the club seems to disagrees with me on that point :/ It's not that he was bad, but he's earning €300k per week. How many defenders in world football earn that?  Plus Bayern needs to reduce their wage bill, and nobody wants to buy their other overpaid players. De Ligt is a good player so he was actually able to find a club who would buy him and pay his wages. Not consistently, with Tuchel this season he became the best in the 2nd half of the season, and the season before with Nagelsmann he was good, but idk if he was the best, Pavard and Lucas were still there and were doing well. Not consistently, with Tuchel this season he became the best in the 2nd half of the season, and the season before with Nagelsmann he was good, but idk if he was the best, Pavard and Lucas were still there and were doing well, and Upamecano was having a great season and was our best defender until that City game.  So De Ligt was undisputedly Bayern's best defender only in the latter part of the last season.  I'm not trying to say he's not good though. If that's true it's extremely marginal. He hasn't consistently been our best CB That's what we said some 20 years ago. I think we’ll end up doing a swap of Sancho for Ugarte, basically helping for FFP/PSR. Also seems like Lindelof might join Jose. That then gives us depth of:   Onana/Bayindir   Dalot/Mazraoui - Yoro/de Ligt/Evans - Martinez/Maguire - Shaw/Malacia/Amass   Ugarte/Casemiro/Collyer - Mainoo/Eriksen   Amad/Antony - Bruno/Mount - Garnacho/Rashford   Hojlund/Zirkzee We took out the main trash, which is the most important thing. Sancho and Case are expensive underperformers, Greenwood is a scumbag. Saudi please It's probably too much to get rid of Case. Needing a decent sized fee to offset his PSR hit and someone wiling to at least take on his wages only leaves Saudi as an option.   You never know though, If you have defenders willing to actually move up the field so your midfield don't have to cover land the size of Pangea by themselves, maybe Case turns out ok for another season or 2 until he's easier to shift. Sancho can still play. I hope they actually sorted things out, I still have hopes for him at United That is if de Ligt plays really. He is a bench player at the NT Hope so, even DCL and never play him unless both are injured idc, I just don't want to always be one injury away from being toothless. Sancho, Ronaldo, and Varane after finishing 2nd the year before. Wasn’t at all delusional to dream big after that :/ Yep. Getting Varane, Sancho and Ronaldo in the same window after coming off an already strong season seemed like it would take us to the next level. But the squad just imploded with drama and being dysfunctional. It didn't help that for anyone who didn't follow the transfer window at the time - and might have missed the Ronaldo-back-to-Manu news - the opening match was a kind of fluke with Ronaldo scoring a brace. It's still a crazy ""what if"" situation all things considered but Ronaldo was 36 and simply not as good as he once was (he wasn't terrible, but definitely many steps below his usual alien standard). RemindMe! 9 months Yeah I agree he should get top 4 but the reason for our dreadful football was poor squad depth. We were missing many important players. Injuries will be a major factor this season. If we have a season with very little injuries still playing shit then sure he should be on the chopping block but just wait and see how the first half goes 70 points, that's my expectation Yeah that one. Why Chelsea and Strasbourgh or City and Girona can do that? That's not what you initially said. That’s the sad part how can a club be 3 years into a project and with £600M spent and not have targets. top 4 is a must and anything else should have United fans scared ""still is based on who they were pursuing this summer"" There was an incredible amount of coverage, and while one could have predicted how things would turn out if you followed his last PL season, it was still the first time in a while that a big name from another top club went to Bayern, the first out of Liverpool's front three to make a move, scored 4 goals in his first 4 games etc. And even if that hadn't been the case, there would have been more excitement around a world-class player that might have lost a step than 16-18 y.o.s most hadn't even heard of beforr Agreed he looked shit in his last season at Liverpool I remember thinking it wouldn't work out. [removed] Vocal devout men of god 🤝 Grooming 14 year olds More importantly it marks what the community will tolerate.   Becoming engaged to a high schooler? Yes.   Premarital sex? No. I think you’re thinking I’m disagreeing that it’s not weird. I’m not. I only said he’s not a pedophile - because he absolutely is not. Grooming is the perfect way to phrase it - but like a community approved groom.   It’s more of an issue of culture and valuation of children. And here Mane is the sum and continuation of the offense. 4 years He arranged the marriage I thought You mean Shaw? The club literally posted today he's out for 3 weeks with a calf injury he's [injured again](https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/injury-update-on-man-utd-defender-luke-shaw-on-13-august-2024) He scored in each of his first three games and then disappeared We ain’t escaping from pogba’s witch doctor 🥲 Upa was easily our best CB in Nagelsmanns second season. His drop in performances was also easily the biggest one off all players after Tuchel joined. Especially with the 3ATB he looked like a top 5 CB in the world. Unfortunately nobody remembers how he played for like 80% of that season because of the 2 games against City. McTominay, Pellistri, Hannibal, etc. not even listed. We’re decent in terms of quantity, hope quality for depth gradually improves too. Amass at LB is lowkey one of the most important LOL Honestly, seeing last year, I still worry about the backline - even though I think on many levels, Lindelof going to Jose makes a ton of sense, having another CB would put my mind at ease. I'd argue that someone who publicly causes unrest can also be classified as trash. And just after having this conversation, Toney is apparently linked to a move to Saudi on insane wages ;_; Second is extremely misleading though. United finished 12 points below City (not too bad) but only 5 points higher than Liverpool who ended the season with 0 senior CBs (Nat Phillips, Rhys Williams, Fabinho sometimes playing there), lost 6 home games in a row etc etc. 74 points in the last 10 years has only finished second twice, 3rd-5th extremely common, and 6th once.   It's the notion that United were never in a position to challenge for the title despite being 2nd which is the misleading part. This is obviously a huge fault of the Glazers, but that should be known by now. Had a feeling we would implode because they forgot that we need a midfield reinforcement. If we added two CM/DMs alongside them, we probably would be in much better situation. I'm expecting a bit of a goal drought, lots of close results. Hojlund and Zirkzee have not shown to be prolific goalscorers, at least not yet. Rashford's not on good terms with the manager (+ bad form), and you can't place your goal scoring expectations on Garnacho. I’d say he’s been a bit more successful than Varane was for United. Savinho was on loan to Girona from Troyes. Troyes is not in the CL so the transfer is okay. As long as you’re not in the same competition it’s okay. CL to Europa is fine. ECL to EL is fine. What if fans have run out of fucks to give? At this stage fans just want to see some decent football from United. I highly doubt United can get top4 this year. I was referring to Doué and Simons, I think Olise and Musiala are the same profile of players who start on the flanks but drift centrally, so Bayern already has that, I don't know what was the strategy in trying to get them, they could have went after a more ""traditional"" winger. That’s true. Mane was a huge signing for them. He was linked with Real the year before for like 120m I do wonder if people like you sit there all smugly like “I’ll sure show those people on the soccer subreddit who knows best with my logic 🤓” only to say the most absurd shit You think they didn’t have any relations before her turning 18? relevant username [removed] No I’m explicitly saying he’s a pedophile That's sick. There's plenty of young 20 year olds out there for anyone to be doing that shit. I'll never understand pedos. I know a Sangoma (South African traditional healer/which doctor). I can fly him to Old Trafford so he can perform a cleansing ritual on the whole stadium.  Even the leaks will stop. It doesn't really matter, Bayern's aim year in year out is Champions League, so if he's crumbling under pressure he needs either mental help from the staff or let go If you play for Bayern and want to be their best CB you can’t perform like that in the CL. Almost doesn’t matter what you do 80 % of the season. Living up to the pressure is part of the job and Dayot didn’t live up to it. He is 16, we cant expect him to play at all this season, he will get bullied. World of a difference between that and what Greenwood did. One shitstirred at work, the other is a criminal who by all means should be serving a lengthy sentence right now. The main problem was that our attack had been pretty fluid and worked great towards the end of the season with Rashford - Martial - Greenwood. And signing Sancho was supposed to let us play Greenwood up top instead of Martial and Sancho on the right. Then Ronaldo came as well and took that spot and Sancho never showed up. So our attack became dysfunctional and static. Then the Greenwood case happened as well leaving us with no good RW. Our entire attack collapsed within half a year. Bro who told you Rashford is not on good terms with the manager? Hojlund passed the eye test for me. He got a severe lack of service from his wingers and was clinical when given the actual chance. The boy needs to be fed this season. Yeah and? Ah I thought it's europe in general, thanks for the info I dont think its impossible no? The grooming by itself is bad enough. No need to invent stuff. [removed] You are factually incorrect. 17 but your point is correct. By all accounts he seems a step above the youth teams but is not there yet for the first team. Sure. Nobody disputes Greenwood is a horrible human being. Doesn't mean Sancho can't be called trash. Attack was one of the problem we had with that season, yeah, but our midfield also struggled, losing battles in most games. As a result, we were forced to sit back deeper than before and couldn't counter properly, putting our defense under more pressure. Is that wrong? I thought that was the case ever since the Wales incident. I think the goal drought will stop once he starts to rack up the goals. He was very good for short bursts, scoring many goals at once. If he can keep up those for a bit longer he could put up some scary numbers. You tell me. Do you seriously think a six-time league champion was a bad transfer? Or are you just lost? She was his ""long time"" girlfriend before getting married. I don't believe im inventing anything. He wanted her when she was 14, the dude is a pedo All the more reason to move him to first team to gain experience. He’ll be ready next season. I hope we get Ferdi tho. I have no confidence in Shaw and Malacia’s fitness. Rashford apologized and they moved on. The one thing Sancho could never do. But luckily for us he likely will fuck off to PSG where he will fit like a glove. If Ronaldo got benched by Ten Hag because they fell out.... why would he start Rashford if there was an issue? Over in form Garnacho? He honestly scored quite a few goals for a player his age, but they did seem to come in bunches. I think it's tied to the teams inconsistency more than Hojlund. It was an arranged marriage. I don't think they spent much time together, let alone time alone together, before the marriage Guess there is a lack of cultural understanding here. You realize not every person on earth fucks their girlfriend before the age of 18/marriage right? Humans exist on earth that wait till marriage.  So, yes definitely inventing. Just because its normal in Western society doesnt mean its the case across the world. Hell some people in Western countries wait till marriage. Yeah 16 goals in all comps at 21 is very good. If he can get 15 goals in the prem instead of 10 he's all of a sudden one of the top ten strikers in the league, easily. Arranged by who? Mané? Asking because I genuinly don't know Him and her parents, yes. Traditionally, there is very little contact and zero sexual contact pre marriage in an arranged marriage."

Hope we don't increase the bid. was letzte preis? He""ll go for Schone from NEC and Tadic from Fenerbahce next. Don’t forget to invite Haller and Tadic back to the reunion gang. Without them in-front, almost impossible to re-enact Ajax’s success Bro is adamant on rebuilding Ajax We Ajax now, next: WESLEY SNEIJDER /s 2 from 1 club, same summer is crazy They really trying to get our squad back, huh? I buy 2 you give me discount heh? zirkzee, yoro, obi martin, mazraoui, de ligt, (ugarte maybe) this is a great transfer window for united Why don't more clubs use the manager's LinkedIn as their scouting network? Cut their phone lines, break their fax machines, put the entire city in a Faraday cage! Stay away! Ten hag is never beating the allegations Every single transfer window we are hearing that premier league club X is having troubles with PSR or what is this called and then they are going into transfer window spending 200m euro just like that , it doesnt make any sense at all xD Has the Ugarte deal died? Have a feeling the final figures will be one i am not happy with which im not surprised. We have no leverage now I guess the 70m should do the trick, right? oh? i assume that means wan bissaka deal must be about to be agreed then. but de ligt aswell? is that mctominay money, does that mean no ugarte, guess it does seem likely that casemiro is staying now It's actually mental to me how many ex Ajax players they are signing lol Oh hell yeah baby you still need Ziyech! he is in a good form now in preseason, please do it! Why, are we opening a new sick bay wing or what? United looking scary lowkey Greedy bas***ds  Preferred it when Utd were the meme team. At this point, i really cant tell if he's doing this because he's clueless or he sees a bigger picture that regular people cant see. Would be additions that hugely raises the floor of our defence     First choice back line for me is still Shaw, Martinez, Yoro and Dalot, but having this strength in depth would be a big upgrade Operation ETH's Ajaxians Assemble United have been trying to spend a stupid amount of money lately. Let's see if it ends up okay....kinda doubt it will tbh I just want de ligt. West ham offer for awb is insulting, I'd renew his contract but I'm in the minority. Allow it fam Is Mazraoui that good? Always so it was okay but not Man Utd okay more like Fulham okay… Actually same for de Ligt who has a hard time living up to the hype I thought United were laying of the Erik Ajax former player lameness under Ashworth and Co.  Such uninspiring signings. Did they assume that if they combined the same offers then it’d look higher and Bayern would accept or something. Genuinely what is the point in doing a joint bid lol This is turning into a Gaitán/Sneijder saga. Any day now.. WE ARE BARACK [deleted] Why are Bayern selling De Ligt if he's any good? I don’t think these are bad players obviously but I feel like the right back situation they have is fine and I know Yoro is injured but I still feel like they need to address the midfield and attack more than the defence at this stage. You can't have de Ligt, but you can get Upamecano, Sane and Mazraoui if you want... Well, have to give credits to ETH for bringing almost all of that band back together. If he gets FDJ too, it's completed. ETH scouting is almost exclusively Ajax and former Ajax players. I’ve never seen anything quite like it at a big club! Well a good offer might make Barca to sell him to United due to his astronomical current wages. we have Frenkie at home. Issue is that Frenkie was the only one that's actually turned out to be a good player. VdBeek was a disaster, De Ligt is okay but has never been worth hier salary or transfer fee, Mazraoui shows promise but still needs a great season at the top level. no Lasse no party But we already created a Frenkie Sold VdV :( get sneijder out of retirement and fulfill the prophecy Bayern might have bumped the De Ligt price up after the Ito injury Let's wait for the fee, but I would've expected this to accelerate quickly since we are looking to sell aswell Likely you guys didn’t reach the €50 mil plus add ons Pletti has been mentioning non stop for De Ligt This almost sounds like the agent was told what Bayern would need to get to sell the players but Bayern are now charging either a ""Utd are shit in the transfer market""or a Yoro's injury premium.    I'd imagine the joint bid might become two separate bids for accounting purposes depending on what suits Bayern best. I wouldn't be surprised if the final details were negotiated in person or via phone as opposed to being written down/anywhere that leaves a record. Need the players to put pressure on Bayern here then. Says they were told they could leave and the club would compromise to make it happen so hopefully the players can help us out a little here ETH money laundering connoisseur A lot of people who watch him regularly now tell me that his development has hit a roadblock and he isn't as good as he was when he was a kid. Me, I haven't seen him since he was at Ajax. Had a lot of time during college those days so watched plenty of football. I'll die on the hill that MdL was the best teenage CB I've ever seen in my 2 decades of watching football. Always gonna have a soft spot for him and FdJ. He's still just 24 so hopefully he can reach his potential with us Following the same rhetoric of him being the only sellable asset   He is a good defender but nowhere near worldclass No he’ll retire at United I know what you mean but from our perspective it really does not matter. Mazraoui is worth 0 in our books and De Ligt \~40. It doesn't matter how you distribute the fee, the result will be the same.     E.g. sell Maz for 20 and De Ligt for 50, that's +20 profit on  and +10 profit on De Ligt which means +30 (taxable) profit for both. If we sell Maz for 50 and De Ligt for 20, it's +50 profit on Maz and -20 on De Ligt, but in total it's still +30 (taxable) profit.  It might make a difference for you guys though, especially if they get different contract lengths or if you sell one of them before the other. Time for her to emulate raiola and throw some chairs Be interesting to know what the bid is and what Bayern want.  It might be better to pay something extra to get the deals done in the next week. Trying to penny pinch til last week of window won’t be smart.  Though ultimately depends on how far apart the two clubs are.  I imagine it will get done given we have a selling club and a buying club and no other suitors. The price we are asking - 50+ add-ons for de Ligt and ~20m€ for Maz - is already a big compromise on their actual value, so unless Ornstein reports actual numbers and they meet that I dont give a fuck what Pimenta thinks. Maybe the bid has a structure issue but it seems odd if they have told the agent a price and to look for deals and then reject it. 40€ mein kuseng kommt holen Would take Tadic at this stage ngl don't forget the amount Bayern already received from us this summer for Zirkzee's sell-on clause This is Manchester United. They are a huge club in terms of revenue. They'll always have money to spend even when limited by PSR.    This window has been pretty dead as clubs aren't getting the offers they became accustomed to receiving. Victor Osimhen is still sitting in Napoli because of this. Lots of other similar cases. No leverage?? We can simply walk away , no ? We say this every season tho - has been said every year for the last decade without fail Early to not say we still are. I feel like this has been said a bit too often You say that as if United haven’t been making these huge signings the entire time lol United making a ton of expensive signings of players represented by super agents is as predictable as the ""hottest summer ever"" every year. Current de ligt def better than current yoro imo, plus too many matches at his age won't be good for him Yoro is for rotation and development. No top club is signing an 18 year old as their first choice CB. If your manager wants De ligt and De ligt wants United, he’s not coming there to be a rotation player lol. Because, and this is a crazy concept, we want both players.  It also lets Bayern list the fees as whatever way is most beneficial for them. If you buy two items at a supermarket, do you go to the checkout counter twice? its not rocket science, we want both players. Bayern want to sell/are willing to sell both players.   United: ”Hey, Bayern! We can make that easy for you and buy both those players for a little discount, makes it easy for you!”  Doesn’t seem that pointless? Obamna They wanted 70m total, no? They definitely need a cb but after they sell Lindelof Definitely need another CB more than an attacker.   Agree we need a midfielder but if we went into this season without another CB, it’d be a disaster. Whilst we’re not winning anything major with that attack, I’m happy enough with it because you can’t do everything in one window. Maybe a cheeky Neres as well..? Thought i heard he’s doing okay at Benfica. But the real bomba would be Lasse Schöne 🔥 If he gets Ziyech too I’ll start supporting United That’s probably going to be the plan in the January window lol Needs to bring back Davinson Sanchez Pulls Dan Ashworth into his office first day on the job.   ""I know you've got plans Dan but just watch this""  *Ajax 2018/19 Champions League Run Highlights & Tekkers* > ETH scouting is almost exclusively FC Utrecht and former FC Utrecht players. I’ve never seen anything quite like it at a big club!  2018-2020 (Haller, Labyad and Klaiber)   the cycle continues Antony still is an incredibly stupid transfer as he never really showed anything that warrants such a high price, but especially de Ligt is just a great deal imo for a player who is still fairly young and has performed on the highest level in multiple leagues. Would have made more sense to steal some of the scouts working at Ajax who discovered these players in the first place, to find younger similar players not requiring high fees.  The difference would be United could afford to keep them long term instead of having them poached by bigger clubs.  (Don't tell ETH, but this is more or less the strategy Edu and Arteta have implemented to position them to challenge City.) Either this is genuine sarcasm or you must not be familiar with Louis van Gaal’s time at Barcelona. Dutch arrogance is quite a drug. Although MDL is still a big name transfer for ManU. Makes Bayern look stupid after how they invested in a future leader.  [deleted] The thing is that our fanbase ignore this bid red flag and also he struggles with his relationships with any other player. He has had issues with Sancho, Ronaldo, Varane, Case, DDG even at one point started pointing fingers at Garnacho.  I pray we dont start doing this shit and let Edwards/Hughes do their job. This deal actually doesn't seem too bad but its just so...uninspired. The problem has never been convincing Barca to sell though, just convincing Frenkie to join them It would need to be a stupidly high offer because it doesn’t make too much sense for Barca to sell FdJ Nah, it is Barca who have Mainoo at home. Relatively, i don't think frenkie is worth his humungous wages either I think most of them were great, Onana did very well at Inter, Neres and Blind were doing well at Benfica and Girona, De Ligt did quite well, even Veltman was solid, the biggest disappointments were Ziyech and Van de Beek Football fan standards are _absurd._  Only Frenkie turned out to be a good player?  Mazraoui is obviously very good. Maybe not one of the few absolute elites, but he’s a good player for sure. Donny van de Beek didn’t turn out, which is a shame.  But the idea that _Matthijs de Ligt_ didn’t turn out to be a good player is fucking mental. How your comment is sitting on 55 upvotes, I have no idea.  This feels like one of those ‘if they’re not Messi they’re shit’ comments. De Ligt is the best CB at Bayern. They would get rid because of his wages,  same thing with Frenkie and Barca. De Ligt was Juve's best defender when he left and is arguably also Bayern's best defender (and one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga in the 2022/23 season, which he could've also been last season if he wasn't injured for a fairly large part of it). People just seem to write him off just because he isn't an undisputed top 3 defender in the world after the hype he got at Ajax. I dont think any of them have been worth the transfer fee and the wages paid in total except Mazraoui, not that he has been very good but more in terms of him being a free agent and no monstrous salary.  For all the promise they showed when they were in Ajax their career has been a bit disappointing so far imo Who is VdV?  Do you mean van de Beek? van der Vaart never played for Yanited though? And the Yoro one Upamecano, Dier, Kim, Stanisic should be enough even if no one new is coming Yesterday’s price isn’t today’s price probably will..orny does mention talks are continuing in order to agree a deal so shouldnt be too long as we need a cb in after Yoro injury and as soon as AWB leaves Maz and Bayern will want to buy Tah so win win Maybe. But the players camps both felt like Utd met what it would take to allow them to leave. It also mentioned that the players were informed by Bayern that the club would be willing to compromise to help the process. And Ito got injured so Bayern have one less CB for the start of the season and there were reports that they are considering not selling De Ligt in response to that What pressure do you expect lol, this is no charity especially after you paid up for Yoro Ajax now the wealthiest team in the world, ahead of the Saudi club. De Ligt is really good, just maybe not what a modern posession team is looking for  I'll be gutted to see him leave as he's our best pure defender, but he's rather slow and doesn't have elite passing A lot of great defenders bloomed a bit later. Defenders need more experience to learn how to be better and how to handle different situations, than attackers do. But even then most players peak later.  The problem is that he was amazing looking when younger and hasn’t taken the step yet. But he has also been judged harshly due to his transfer fees and that has nothing to do with him. His only questionable season was the last, where he had injuries and Tuchel wasn't convinced by him. He still ended up the best CB paired up with Dier at the end of the season. He was immense during his first season with Bayern, defending on the halfway line to put pressure on opponents and taking out players one on one.  At Juve he had some issues adjusting to a different country and playstyle and he had some bad luck. His handballs were posted on this sub and everyone decided that he was overrated and a failure based on that alone. In fact he ended up carrying Juve, he was their entire defense at some point. The team was basically De Ligt in the back, Ronaldo up front and 8 traffic cones.  That isn't to say there aren't issues with him though. He has become more well rounded and developed his leadership qualities while at Juve, but on the ball he has clearly regressed. His passing and distribution has become shocking after leaving Italy, especially compared to how confident he used to be. Slightly pedantic but he's 25 in 10 days, definitely not a 'potential' CB anymore the main problem is not his skill but his wage and injuries. Juve gave a 20 yo a monster contract and bayern one upped the contract. He is one of the best earning CBs but misses like 10-20 games per season. If he stays fit he might be worth the contract but it makes valuing the overall package very hard. [deleted] Ah, I see. Seems we're offering the same contract to both so guess it won't really matter People used to ask for Raiola instead of her because she’s the brutal one lmao How much would you say is their actual value? Interested to see Bayern fan's perspective on this because I feel like €70m + add-ons for 2 players you want to get rid of is a bit steep. But I don't watch them play and idk how good they actually are.  Entschuldige sie bitte ich warte noch auf auto von kuseng ist ok wenn ich hole morgen????? Maybe maz but no chance we can just walk on this de ligt deal. Any cb we get after him will he a substantial fall off in quality and we need a good cb as much as we need A centreback at all. Yeah but that’s when we were ran by bankers and glazers This time it’s different. Trust me. Sure, let's just ignore how the entire football operations side of the club is changed from last summer, and now there are actual competent people working there rather than bankers  That is the reason why there is optimism of Utd improving in the coming years - not just because they're spending money I for sure see this comment every transfer season, I'm convinced it's karma farming. Innit. Could turn out to be good signings or could end up with Gary Neville saying ""The Glazers signed the wrong players"" in two years time on the Overlap. They’ve signed two players… Please list the ton of players we signed this summer Agreed, De Ligt is not coming to sit on the bench.  He will rotate some but he will rightfully expect to start the biggest games with ETH as coach. True, but maybe Utd does. Tbf while de Ligt is definitely in our strongest pair with Licha, I’d imagine the reason we wanted two is to rotate when the schedule gets hectic to keep them all fit.   Until Yoro got wrecked in his second game… When has a joint bid ever worked? Genuine question. And why would Bayern give a discount for that? Because it saves 30 seconds of admin? United were 9th in goals scored and 5th for least conceded I think the attack is a bigger issue. Might need Veltman, Tagliafico, Blind, Huntelaar and Pasveer too What's Van de Beek up to these days The only man in history that was cold enough to score a free kick at the Bernabeu winning 4-1 yet couldn’t handle a packed National Arena missing a penalty to send us through If garnacho leaves (very less probability though) next season, then the target might be neres lo *Despacito* *""You blew a 3-0 lead to Spurs.""* United will bend over backwards for a run like that. Yeah both of these deals make sense. If you want to critique one it would be the Mazraoui one but he is a very good player Agreed. However had we not massively overpaid his £25 million valuation, I don't think we would be having this conversation. For 25 Mil, you get a young player with potential and who has exciting moments and it's easier to forgive his lack of consistency and lapses in concentration. But at £85 million, we shot ourselves in the foot. At that price you expect a finished product and it puts a lot of pressure on a player to live up to that price tag. De Ligt made Juve and Bayern worse. No idea what the hell you're talking about here but if he performed at the highest level why the fuck did they both sell him?  Unreal comment. De Ligt clearly made both teams worse and that's why they don't want him.  Another fucking idiotic decision from our clueless manager. He won't last til Xmas. Mark my words. His signings are an absolute joke. > famous Ajax players  >Eriksen   Well, yeah! Well eriksen did actually play for ajax fyi  «Eriksen began his senior club career at age 18 in 2010, playing for Ajax, where he won three Eredivisie titles» Who’s gonna tell him that Eriksen is a famous former Ajax player?  Edit: love that they removed Eriksen from the list but not before a wall of people called him out over it! Taking Eriksen out is shameless. Own it. Tbf Eriksen was an Ajax player at one point, but look at the likes of Martinez, Onana, Antony and then now Mazraoui and de ligt. And remember that casemiro was plan b after de jong fell through. These were the stars of his best squads it makes sense but it's interesting that united give him so much say over their transfers. Then again they would buy the likes of Maguire so there is that Eriksen actually is a former Ajax player... For me his 3 pillars are Dutch, ex Ajax or ex Eredivisie. That leaves Casemiro, Hojlund, Reguillon and Yoro. His major signings have been Onana, Martinez, Mount, Malacia, Casemiro, Hojlund and Antony.  Onana, Martinez and Antony all Ajax. He clearly wanted De Jong over Casemiro as well. Malacia another eredivisie signing. Now he wants Marazouri and De Ligt. That would make at least 6 of his starting 11 the Ajax side from 18/19 if he got his wish. Don’t edit it coward Eriksen is a former Ajax player tho we ALL know what you said about Eriksen! then you edited the comment. Even among those name it’s clear there’s a massive Dutch/erdivisie bias in the recruitment Eriksen played for Ajax, Mount and Malacia played in the Dutch league and zirkzee is Dutch. Also Reguillon was got rid of very quickly Well two of those are Dutch and one is ex-Ajax so the rest of that list doesn't do a lot to counter the general trend Can't really blame Ten Hag on Sancho and Ronaldo. He's a bit blunt and he can be strict but those two's outbursts are on them personally. We are clearly not doing this. Kokcu. Geertruida. Giménez.   Just some predictions but no worries :) This deal could go either way. De Ligt was benched by Dier in a year Bayern failed to win the league despite Kane scoring a gillion goals (his trophy curse didn’t help tbh). PL is a tough league to be a CB in - the range of threats you face is frankly unpleasant, good players have been exposed and unable to settle. He could prove an inspired signing or fall short.   If he was a dead cert for success, Bayern wouldn’t be so willing to part with him - ask them for a price for  Musiala and the negotiations won’t be so amicable. It also has a bit to do with the lifestyle. You can tell from his instagram that himself and his partner love Spain and don’t want to leave. Seems his partner has a fair bit of away in the decision from what I’ve seen. That man is getting a crap ton of money atm because he deferred his wages a few years back and now is the time where they have to pay the Piper lmao 🤣 It was more that he wanted his wages that were reduced during covid backpaid.  They took a massive cut in their wages to balance the books for them, and these then would be added to their wages in later Years of the contract, basically deferred his wages.   Barca wanted to sell Frenkie before these backdated wages kicked in, without paying out the difference. Frenkie rightfully said I'll only go if you pay it out.  His wages now look insane but it's becsuse he's now receiving his normal pay plus the deferred covid wages. It could be different now but it’s irrelevant since Mainoo is already there That's also kind of weird though. Every year United comes with an offer, barca accept (reportedly) and FDJ rejects. There is a point when FDJ should know right. Barca wants to sell him really badly though That kid has the talent to be as good as Frankie tbh. Super hyped for him. No-one does. His wages were huge and signed during peak pre-pandemic football wage madness. The deferrals sent them into the stratosphere. He knows no-one is matching them on top of a big transfer fee and he knows Barca aren’t about to match close to his initial contract on renewal. He’ll probably be a free transfer in a couple seasons with a big signing on fee and then a salary in the more normal range. He is being paid for 2 seasons at once now, still on high wages tho Onana did do well for Inter but man does he look very suspect for us. Just a PSV fan hating on Ajax players. Thanks for calling the insanity out. The hype around that Ajax team though, the players certainly didn't live up to the hype. de Ligt was wanted by everybody at the time and now I don't think he makes it into most top sides. He obviously means MDL hasn’t lived up to his potential. You’d think when watching him back then he’d be one of the very best, but since then he’s been sold for a loss by 2 massive clubs and he’s made no progress internationally mazraoui plays well for bayern but he doesn't play much at all. He is often injured or at the africa cup.   footballing wise i think he is a joy to watch. can play both LB and RB at a high level. so many pace merchants hunting down attackers on the wings but he can dribble, he can pass, cross and combine with other players really well. The minutes he played for bayern in the bundesliga reveal his big downside, availability.   also rumour is that bayern officials don't like his beard. he spread some anti israel video etc I think they’re more meaning relatively? Is de Ligt a good player? Obviously, but whether he’s ended up being good enough to justify is salary and ~150m in transfer fees is a different matter You must admit that MDL’s hype was sky high after that UCL run. I broadly agree with you but yeah. I think I was fair. Frenkie is great, De Ligt has always underperformed and is really error prone. He'd be amazing for half the transfer fee and a low salary, but he's played below expectations at the highest level. I'd rate his succes higher if he were a 20 million player at a mid-table team. And as I said, Mazraoui could get there but I'm waiting for a great season at the top. Eric Dier exists  I cant believe I mean this (almost) unironically That's what they said at Juve as well. If he was Van Dijk at his prime, they would pay the salary whatever it took. De Ligt has underperformed compared to what Juve and Bayern expected of him. For a 20 million fee and 500k a year he'd be a steal, but as of now he hasn't been worth it for any team since his Ajax spell. >People just seem to write him off just because he isn't an undisputed top 3 defender in the world after the hype he got at Ajax.  Well that and the fact that his two recent teams treated him like he was surplus to requirements. People who don't watch the matches and just base their opinions on headlines and optics might come to the conclusion that he's not good enough or even a flop. You have to remember that this sub is very premier league centric so take any “observations” about players outside of the premier league with a grain of salt. They’ve only witnessed these players in Champions league matches. They haven’t seen them play in league matches week in and week out He's too error prone to be good enough for world class teams. A decent defender for sure but he brings his a-game 75% of the time. That's why he was the third option at the world cup and that's why he'll often end up being third choice at top teams. He'd be an amazing starter for a subtop team like United, or maybe Atalanta, Sevilla, Lyon or Leverkusen. Yep stupid autocorrect haha I wish Stanisic is also needed as a right back with Mazraoui gone. So not ideal to only have 3 CBs 4 CBs is as thin as possible for a champions league team They’re wanting Tah to come in following a De Ligt exit. They’ve been after him all summer. Also Tarek Buchmann if he can stay healthy I could be wrong but I don’t think Bayern will buy Tah. If they are firm on 40 mil. It’s double what Bayern want to pay for him and can get him on a free next summer The article says it was reiterated to them that Bayern are still open to selling those two And Bayern just lost Ito for months Well they don't want MDL and want Tah, and cant sign Tah without selling MDL, so there's the pressure bit.  Think that's obvious for everyone, except you apparently. Yes every transfer is the same and the situation of the buying club and the players isn't a factor at all. Yoro was also being forced out of Lille like these two and had eyes for no other club That just sounds like Harry Maguire He hasn't taken the step to the absolute top yet, but he has been one of the best defenders in both the Bundesliga and Serie A in most seasons he's played (even when Juventus was an absolute dumpster fire). 25 is still rather young for a defender, no? He's 24 until he's 25 He's 24 before he is 25? Tbf 25 is quite young for a cb We signed Dier because we wanted to buy a CB in the summer window anyway and didn't manage to do that, and because in the first half of the season at least half of our 4 CB were injured at any time. It was not about the quality of the position, but about the quantity. Maz flexibility and base quality should normally price him at around 30-35m€, around what has been paid for Zinchenko, Hall, Livramento, Reguilon, Digne etc.  And De Ligt is the same player he was at Juve, and we paid 67+10m€ for that. That's not what I'd expect, I'd say an offer of all in including easy to get add-ons of 65m€ should be a normal demand.  And what I expect we demand is 20m€ all in for Maz and like 50+7 for de Ligt. Bayern needs to get rid of De Ligt more than we need him. Its a case of who blinks first. The Yoro injury should not change much for our stance on DeLigt. I really don't understand why people keep saying this though, we are not gonna be good over night but we are not sitting and waiting for Joel Glazer's approval to raise 1GBP on a bid. It'll take 2-3 summers to get there but there is a clear difference in how we operate. They paid 60m for a teenager to be their starter. That is prime United behaviour.     Yes I know Madrid wanted him but they didn't want him for 60m. Yet its still Eths old buddies we are bringing again isnt it? No one can blame the glazers for any signings this summer He will do his classic routine inspired by Mac, playing on both sides so he comes out on top either way its about to work,then your question will be answered. Because it makes the sale of both players a sure thing rather than hoping that another club comes in and pays what Bayern want. Lmao 🤣 I don’t think people realize that bogo doesn’t work for player transfers. This is why a joint bid is very confusing since Bayern likely have specific price points ie €50 mil plus add ons for De Ligt and around €20-25 mil for maz We’ve bought a striker and Amad is fit now. Thats two additions to the attack. Between that and hopefully Garnacho continuing to improve, there’s room to improve there.   Solidifying the defence might actually allow us to play a little higher than when we had Evans and Casemiro at the back… While de Ligt isn’t quick, he has plenty of experience in a higher line. ten Hag wants to be more aggressive so we need defenders who can do it. We can’t keep hoping Licha is going to be fit and fall off a cliff when he isn’t. Our attack will continue to develop since it’s very young; I would say the biggest need is DM. If you watched us last season teams were running through our midfield like it didn’t exist. Feeding the attack was a bigger problem than the attack itself. Amad has looked very sharp this pre season and the end of last season. Zirkzee is bolstering the number 9 position. Reports are Rashford is back fit and his head seems with it again (Mitten who has a lot of contacts in the club say they think he looks like 2022 Rashford in his approach). And Sancho is back in the fold  Rashford/Sancho Zirkzee/Hojlund Garnacho/Amad Bruno/Mount  Is a lot of depth. Garnacho can also be played off the left if both rashford and Sancho aren’t performing and Amad looks like he’s improved.  We basically need what every top team wants. A CDM who can pass progressively. Check avg shot(and on goal) allowed by United last season… Also VDB who we just sold 2 Blind 2 Unite, or something. He already was van Gaals Dutch bud years ago. Recently sold to Girona He is the next icon for united he ain't leaving for next 5yrs [In this house we are only about Aly Cissokho - Fever for the Flava](https://vimeo.com/92846254) Danza Kuduro https://youtu.be/dnlWXRNZAD4?si=ipvEPitcIkPlkmPc in 45 minutes Which is why he was so highly rated by Chiellini and first in the running of becoming Juve captain. But yeah he made Juve worse. He was also awful at Bayern which is why he made the team of the season in 2022/23 for his bad performances. Sorry, but what? He did not make us worse. He is still our best CB. The only reason we are selling him is because he is very expensive and selling him would give us a lot of budget to play with. Not to mention people reference the Eredivisie connection in general not just Ajax. He left the Eredivisie and immediately signed one of his rival’s left backs in Malacia. Zirkzee is also Dutch. > but it's interesting that united give him so much say over their transfers  Most polite way to explain the Glazers Yeah if you introduce enough criteria it covers all players.   Besides, it isn't that weird. Almost all managers like players they have seen play regularly. On top of that the eredivisie is a development league, a lot of players start their careers there. Since Ajax is the biggest club in the league chances are players have come trough there at some point.  But it is beating a dead horse at this point anyway. Ten Hag is shit at picking transfer targets, something Ajax fans warned about when he first joined Man U. That is why he doesn't have the power to decide on transfers on his own anymore. You make good points, but I’d like to point out that FDJ almost certainly would have been a better investment than Case, can’t really fault him for that one. [deleted] Sure, Sancho and Ronaldo are cunts indeed. But the being bad man manager is not something to brag about really. Geertruida I can totally see. one is okay, but thats enough I can't imagine how depressing Manchester would be after living in Barcelona. Earning millions and leaving in Barcelona.   If I were pro footballer I would aim for Madrid, Mediolan, Paris or Barca.  No matter what money I would never choose England. They’d still have to pay that back pay if they sold him now. But his girlfriend/wife doesn’t want to leave Barcelona unless they really have to. > His wages now look insane but it's becsuse  ...Barcelona is really bad at managing their finances. Not really. End of the day, a transfer is between 3 parties, the buying club, the selling club, and the player themselves. If any of them don't want to do it, they can stop the entire thing. Sure, the player is usually the easiest party to agree with, but they aren't forced to accept uprooting their family and lives because two other parties agreed to do it why would he leave? he lives in a great city with beautiful weather, his family is happy there, plays for one of the best clubs in the world and he's getting paid extremely well. And honestly i think after his current deal is over he can get a new one at Barca at reasonable but still very good wages if he wants to, its not like they want him out because he's shit. ""Every year""? It was once. Lmao, FDJ is a good player, but using him as a threshold talent on how mainoo can be good is outrageous.  FDJ is on Jong Ajax and Sitting on the bench on Netherlands U-20 when he was on Mainoo age.  Not to mention he hasn't prove shit ever since he come to barca. He got lucky Pedri and Gavi took turn on being injured. He was benched when they were healthy. It's not pre-pandemic wage madness. It's peak bartonomics so he can fuck the next president Are they actually still paying him or do they still owe him wages? But my point is that hype is arbitrary and made up. It’s not a valid way of judging someone.  It’s unfair to say ‘I think this teenager will be the best ever’ and if they go on to have a better career than 90% of footballers still say they underachieved or didn’t live up to their hype/potential.  Judge players by what they are, not what you decided you wanted them to be. When people tell me that Neymar and Rooney didn’t live up to their potential it makes me want to tear my hair out. The players certainly lived up to the hype while still at Ajax, knocking out Real Madrid and making it to Champions League semi final. Hes not near the prime age for a center back Feel like de Ligt just needs stability. He’s turned out to be a very good player but he keeps moving around top teams, & even when he found his footing at Bayern, injuries suddenly started becoming an issue.   I still think he’ll achieve his potential, his play is still really good. Don’t judge a person on what you expect them to be. Judge them on what they are. I still don’t think that’s a fair assessment of him. And the guy went on to start for Juve and Bayern ever since.  Just because random people on the internet go ‘this is the best teenager I’ve ever seen’ doesn’t negate the fact that he’s been an elite centre back since he was 18 years old.  I’m genuinely so bored of internet rhetoric around ‘hype’ and ‘potential.’ Oh, he didn’t live up to his potential. _There’s literally no way of knowing that, you just made it up!_ He wasn't really at Juve though, he was poised to become their new captain after Chiellini left, but they needed money and he was one of the only players who was highly valued while also being on high wages. why would he often end up third choice at top teams when he has been a first choice for majority of times so far at top teams. Sure, de Ligt isnt as good as expected, but that was also because the expectations were of him to become a generational defender. He would be a starter for most teams apart from Real, Liverpool, City and Arsenal, but so far indeed he hasnt been worth his wages and transferfee which is the reason hes being sold while being a starter. Another reason is that he is one of the few players that can actually bring in some big funds for these teams Hahaha I got you We have Boey and Kimmich for RB as well. They'd have four though with Tah if they got this deal done no? But doesn’t selling de ligt unlock tah for you? Ito isn't dead, and we have youth CBs. (Laughs/cries in Real Madrid) 🤣😭 probably but Fab does keep on saying Tah is your guy's priority apparently Kompany is obssessed with the idea of Tah so lets see..i just hope we sign MDL and Maz before season starts Yeah correct That still makes no sense to just start unreasonable business lmao  ManU is just as desperate for a CB after Yoro's big injury, this is a 2 sided sword Yoro was absolutely forced out of Lille, that's the only reason he's at United. tbf to Maguire his passing ability is outstanding, he’s just reaaaalllly slow. Harry is an elite passer. It's his defending that's shit at times. Yeah but less shit you know I honestly haven’t seen much of him in a while so haven’t a clue how he has been. Just stating that people are always quick to jump on players before they reach their potential because of transfer fees I think when you're 8 top-flight seasons into your career you can't be considered to have untapped potential You are right! >Maz flexibility and base quality should normally price him at around 30-35m€,  A player who is injury prone, isn't in the club's plan and already had a deal agreed for significantly less. Sure  >De Ligt is the same player he was at Juve, and we paid 67+10m€  He is also now 2 years older, on larger wages which is why bayern want to get rid of him, hasn't fulfilled his potential at 2 clubs now and has had injuries the past year I mean us buying de ligt kinda proves he wasnt planned to be guaranteed starter at 18 Well I mean you guys did the same with Archie Gray no? Florentino Perez would not pay that even for a defender in his prime, he doesn't like spending on defense. De Ligt would be our starter Yoro has obviously never played for Ten Hag and I don't believe Zirkzee has either.  Name a better centre back available for similar money to De Ligt.  Mazroui is the only one I'm not massively hot on. G Nev always finds a way. The attackers don’t create chances that is part of the reason Forgot Antony ? well bring him back in then, simple Van Der Back From Pogback to BlindAgain I might get downvoted for this but what if he wants to follow the Ronaldo formula ;⁠-⁠) The only times I opened Vimeo in the last 10 years are the ~100 times I've watched this video While that is obviously the clear winner, you’ve surely got to make a little room to appreciate Welbz the way Wenger did https://youtu.be/F_ll92cXxOA?si=b6ZTiMR3eUxYeJsH I click on this damn link every time I see it and I always will. This is peak At home Let's wait for EtH to re-assemble Ajax at United and then simply bring back Lucas just to ruin their window/season. Hmmm Arteta can fix him > He was also awful at Bayern which is why he made the team of the season in 2022/23 for his bad performances.  Yet they're selling him. Why is it hard for you to understand? If you, and they, think he is so good then WHY are they selling him?  It doesn't matter what you say. You can't explain that without acknowledging they don't think he's good enough. It really is that simple. Juve fans were calling him a disaster in their last season with them. Bayern now want to sell him after a couple of season too. Why are you just ignoring these red flags? Bit weird tbh.  Bayern and Juve were both walking away with their leagues year after year. They both signed De Ligt and both stopped walking away with their respective leagues. Do the maths, pal.  You think he's good because the standard of Dutch football is in the bin and he's poking out of the lid a bit. He is NOT even close to the level we need for the Premier League. Wait and see. Yea i guess but these 3 criteria are literally his previous circle. It’s the only 3 things he knows from work experience so far. It’s like his linkedin contacts and that just makes me laugh everytime.   But yea other coaches have their vices as well. How often did Mourinho drag Matic with him. Wolverhampton became fc Portugal. Etc. Yeah, De Jong would've been a better signing but also indicative of Ten Hag just going after players without seeing what his squad needs. His midfield signings would've been Mount and De Jong to go along with Bruno. Was he wanting to fit all three of them in the team at once and how the hell was he wanting to do that?  If you wanted De Jong he should've been targeted instead of Mount with a water carrier next to him and Bruno as a 10 and if he wanted Mount and Bruno as two 8's then you should've been after an out an out 6. It's like he knew you were light in midfield and didn't care about the profile, just wanted de Jong as he worked with him before. That's true. Spending 60M on a 30 year old case was over valued. But no one would have thought he would regress this much in two years also.  But FDJ also asks for another player who can act as a pivot  to complement him or he is gonna be that good player but not great type in a lot of matches. arent you the guy that forgot that eriksen played for ajax then edited the comment? Mount is a good player but I absolutely do think it’s a factor in why he was signed there’s too many examples now of this bias to be a co incidence for me. Being blunt and strict does not equate bad man manager.  Your examples are stupid as well. What issues with Varane, Case, DDG and Garnacho?  Varane was often injured and still demanded a starting spot. Case has been absolute shit last season, so he absolutely has no reason to be mad about not being selected for the FA Cup final. What about DDG?  He called Garnacho out because he was making mistakes that he shouldn't. They are also on good terms. Remember the FA Cup final? Also a horrible example. Somehow i can totally see Kokcu. Was captain for Slot the year Feyenoord won the Eredivisie. He left for Benfica and it started out a little troublesome for him there.. And i think i read some articles of how he had some talks with Slot, they have a strong bond I think. Bro Manchester is depressing compared to London let alone Spain. I moved from Manny to London for Uni and can’t go back I wouldn’t worry too much about a Chelsea fans understanding of the situation. They’re still upset about a match 15 years ago that they can’t remember or weren’t alive for, but still let it influence their daily thinking when it comes to the sport. The mismanagement happened when they signed those high baseline contracts to begin with. The wage payment deferral is a financially brilliant move if you can't convince the players to outright reduce their wages.  It gives you time to balance your books during a crisis, a chance for the player to want to leave before the deferred wages end in which case you can probably negotiate them down if not just write them off, and the deferral is very likely not inflation adjusted so you basically ""get"" money by doing anyway. Ya, that's agreed. But if a club accepts an offer every transfer, it means you are not that much valued also, right. I said on that basis. Yeah, agree that. I am saying on the basis that since barca is accepting offers every year, it means he isn't that valued that much, right.  But yeah, the concern is not his sporting but mostly his wages. > And honestly i think after his current deal is over he can get a new one at Barca   I dont see that happening tbh. When Barça sorts their finances the first thing they will do is to get rid off him and find someone better. Also a lot of Barça fans have turned on him a bit and his signing is seen a bit like a failure. He has not improved in 5 years, the fact that his season his wages are monstrous doesnt help, he has a ton of injuries and he is currently in Ibiza on holidays despite not having played the  Euros but the rest of the injured Barça players like Araújo are all in Barcelona recovering which doesnt look good of Frenkie tbh.  >  its not like they want him out because he's shit.  He isnt shit, but he isnt mega elite level either. Haha ok And it was beautiful! He's being paid his deferred wage now, apparently he's the top earner in La Liga. (If you don't count Mbappe's 'bonus' payments) I do get where you're coming from. People do tend to take it to ridiculous extremes, especially with Rooney. Any suggestion that being one of England's greatest ever players is disappointing is simply absurd.   However, I still think there is merit in the discussion when considering a player's improvement (or lack thereof). It's a shame that some of De Ligt's best football has come as a teenager, purely because players tend to improve as they get older.   Similarly, it would be disappointing if Yamal turned out for Stockport for the rest of his career. That's still phenomenally good at football, a level miles above 99% of footballers. That isn't living up to the hype, that was what gave them the hype. Writing should have been on the wall when they bottled it to Tottenham of all teams. That’s a pretty terrible philosophy in football given massive transfer fees are forked out on players based on their potential Feel's like you are just angry because he is linked to your club and people don't rate him that highly. If he were rated that highly surely City, Madrid etc would have been interested. He wont be even in the top 5 CB's in the Prem if he comes. I didn’t say he wasn’t?🤣🤣🤣🤣  But have your moment, seems like you need to vent👏🏾👏🏾 Boey hasn't shown anything yet which makes relying on  him a major risk. Kimmich seems to be available for sale as well and also does not prefer that position so I wouldn't count him either The Tah deal is close to collapsing apparently so. Yeah but they have to buy Tah.  Could just reject your offer and keep De Ligt. There's types of passing. Maguire can hit long diagonals and play accurate through balls if you give him time, but compared to someone like Martinez it's night and day. Martinez can play the ball on the ground to feet through a press like and he can do it under pressure. Pep attributed City's FA Cup loss specifically to his passing ability and how it nullifies a press. Harry can't really do anything remotely like that. He's also actually pretty good at dribbling for a CB.  He's just as you say. Absolutely glacial. His defending itself is solid, his issue is that he really does turn like a truck.   Maguire would thrive in a low-block system but both Ole & now Erik love playing really high lines, a player like Maguire simply can’t make that work. So was harry before we signed him lol what. Then how can you claim he hasn’t “taken a step yet” when you haven’t even watched him play. What a ridiculous thing to comment when you haven’t even seen this player in years. Like, weren't Rudiger's best years in his last 20s and early 30s? Feel that happens a lot for defenders. Virgil was a late bloomer too. Not that it’s any guarantee, but with CBs I can see experience and age playing a big factor in growth except for a lot of defenders? Guys like van Dijk, Alderweireld, Rudiger and even way back a player like Stam only went to the absolute top in their mid 20's I don't disagree? The user asked me what I think the players would be normally worth after I said that we are already compromising on their value exactly because of the factors you laid out. If we didn't want to sell them then I think they would be valued around what I said, but we want to sell them which is why Maz goes for 10-15m€ less, and de Ligt for 15m€. No, our first choice is still Bissouma. Calafiori? Though that’s based on what I’m hearing of de ligt’s decline, the de ligt of a few years ago was a de light Well, it has been their fault until now for not installing the right football set up. INEOS turning up and deciding to build football management infrastructure with some very experienced as historically successful people like Ashworth and Berrada is a far cry from “yeah do your thing Mr Woodward”. Fully remembered him, just don’t care. We'll claim the 50% of the profit aswell! Just saying..: Depay is a free agent 👀 If he achieved what Ronaldo did at United before he goes then fine by me. ""Strength"" ""Power"" ""Determination"" ""Loan Deal""  Dead 😂 > If you, and they, think he is so good then WHY are they selling him?  For financial reasons.  > It really is that simple.  For simpletons, sure it is.  > Bayern and Juve were both walking away with their leagues year after year.  Correlation != causation. Because he's on incredibly high wages and he probably doesn't fit the way Kompany wants to play enough to warrant those wages. In my honest opinion he's still the best and most consistent CB and Bayern from the times I've seen him, but you just want to hate him for some reason even when I give you counterarguments, so I'll just leave you be. Yet Bayern fans were all relieved when they thought he was staying. He deleted Eriksen from his comment without acknowledging his mistake smh...  When you say every year, it was only once, right? Ten Hag's first summer at United. oh he's absolutely not worth his current wages, or anything near it. But he's still good enough to play at Barca and if he's happy there i'm just saying he may accept a contract extension at seriously reduced wages because i dont think he can get anywhere close to his current wages at any serious club Wow, Barcanomics are crazy, thanks. I think he’s the top earner in all of Europe Now ‘I don’t think he’s developed all that much since he was 19’ is a perfectly valid thing to have a discussion about.  It’s far removed from ‘didn’t live up to the hype,’ or ‘he’s just okay’ like this original comment suggests. Those transfer fees have nothing to do with me, _and_, a transfer fee is a measurable quantity. Potential is not.  Saying ‘Antony didn’t live up to the £80 million fee’ is _very_ different to saying ‘Antony didn’t live up to his potential.’  One is an actual thing. One is not. No, I’m ‘angry’ at football rhetoric online. You can see me saying this same thing about Neymar if you go to old Neymar posts. It wasn’t directed at you, Mr. Emoji. It was a general comment in the same vein as the rest of the conversation. it’s only gonna collapse if de ligt doesn’t leave otherwise it’s gonna happen I honestly haven't read enough about the Tah deal to know but I assumed that was just due to the deal dragging out a bit?   So with a genuine offer (maybe) for De Ligt I would've thought it would have been done even just to get De Ligt's wages off the books. MDL is the same, he is overrated by Bayern fans for basically doing nothing. It hurts because it's so true Van Dijk had just joined Southampton at the same age as De Ligt are now. Defenders and keepers get better as they age. It’s all about experience in those positions Rudiger was great at roma when he was 22. They arent saying De Ligt cant/wont improve, only that its unlikely he improves enough I don't think United would like to wait 4-5 years for him to get to a top level Yeah, van Dijk had just moved to Southampton when he was 25. Joined Liverpool at 27. they want deligt to be sold for 40m while we buy tah for 35 mil. so the entire sub can meme bayern executives for the worst deal in football history And Uniteds first choice was always planned to be De Ligt Fair enough Nope, we don't run a record label. Fairs. One UCL can completely turn the tides to United's favour. > For financial reasons.  So you sell your ""best player"" who gives you higher league positions, and better ECL runs, which gives you more money?  Makes sense.  The thing is, he doesn't give them those things, and that's why they're selling him, because he's not good enough in two leagues that are far worse than the Premier League. So what does EtH do? Chases him even though he wasn't good enough in two less competitive leagues.  Fucking genius.  > Correlation != causation.  Sure. If this had happened once, I agree, but it has happened twice and that's just not a coincidence. I don't hate him.  I think he's not Premier League quality.  Big difference. thats poor show. Saw some reports last season too (but mostly Spanish ones). And catalan media puts up articles which say FDJ will be sold off and things like that (and Barca will definitely have a small say in that). Is it really that absurd? I think he's good, but bringing up Rooney and de Ligt in the same conversation for not reaching higher standards? Rooney carried an average team to success, hugely different.  I think it's Maguire that gets shit on to an absurd degree given he's decent, de Ligt has a high reputation for what he does, you have to be kinda vague to pretend de Ligt is actually super successful given his talent. Like he's won the league everywhere he's played, those are great teach accomplishments, dude is also getting sold at a loss from those teams. I mean I appreciate how philosophical you’re getting but even if potential isn’t real in like, an actual sense, the transfer fee paid for a young player is as close a representation as possible of it. It’s what footballing experts whose job it is to assess potential have evaluated it as. The fact two different clubs thought that de Ligt was worth a lot and have subsequently been willing to sell him for a loss is fairly indicative the industry does not perceive him to have lived up to it. Maybe you don’t think potential personally exists but football as a sport is kind of required to Well Neymar is levels above De Ligt though, I can see why you'd say that about him but De Ligt has reached nowhere near Neymar levels.  De Ligt hasn't won a Champions League, he has played for 2 big teams in Juve and Bayern and neither have done anything major during his time there other than win the league but that isn't impressive at Bayern its more impressive that they managed to not win it whilst he was there. Both teams have actually looked worse during his time there (not saying its his fault). He doesn't even start for the Netherlands anymore, its not a reach to say hes nowhere near lived up to the potential he had at one point, it feels weird to be going all out for him as your main target. Relax my guy, it ain’t all that serious. Emojis won’t kill you.  Have a good day🫡 And considering united really don't want to pay what you want for him it doesn't look like it'll happen It's not gonna happen if Leverkusen demands the same price as before, that's the issue, not the de Ligt transfer.  I really hope Tah stays in Leverkusen. They may just wait a year for tah since they can get him on a free next summer United don't want to pay bayern's asking price for de ligt and bayern aren't budging which kind of makes it hard to have a deal go through I would argue that player physicality and technical ability won't improve past certain age, and these are two main weaknesses (speed, range of passing) that people point out in his game de Ligt was great at Ajax when he was 19 But he was already world class at Southampton, and Celtic fans say he was about that good at them as well. Don't think he's a case of drastic development as a player so much as taking a slightly more circuitous route to one of the European giants. > So you sell your ""best player"" who gives you higher league positions  Who said anything about best player?  > I agree, but it has happened twice and that's just not a coincidence.  If it happened twice, that's still statistically insignificant. And Lindelof and Johnny Evans is?   Brother… if you rate MDL that low you need to get your head checked. Again. My entire point is that ‘potential’ is made up.  Yes, I personally think it _is_ a reach to say he’s nowhere near lived up to his potential, precisely because people made up a career for him in their heads when he was 18 and he gets criticised for not meeting it. Y’all gotta stop assuming that because people have opinions that they think it’s serious. would be fine by me, i don’t consider tah to be an enormous upgrade on de ligt And I don’t believe de Ligt is this guy that has to suddenly prove he’s elite, either.  De Ligt is obviously one of the best centre backs in the world. Whether you want to debate if that’s top 10, top 20, it doesn’t matter. He’s clearly elite.  People acting like he’s running out of time to prove his worth is just mad to me. We're not talking about two mid teams here. We're talking about teams who absolutely dominated their respective leagues until he came along.   Don't worry. I'll remind you when it happens a third time. We aren't dominating but we'll see how low we can go before Xmas. Lol. No. Ofc they're not. EtH is a fucking idiot there too.   We're supposed to be improving the team though, not replacing players with others at the same level.  They're all not good enough. That's why we keep leaking goals left and right. Well that and the dog shit goalkeeper we have.  EtH is to blame for all of this. I said that in my first comment. I blame him.  I think its fucking laughable you guys are trying to claim they're selling him for financial reasons. The biggest team in Germany can't afford to keep a player that apparently improves them?  Dude, give me a fucking break. If he's good you keep him. They offered him those wages to start with. What sort of a ludicrous argument is that? I genuinely can't believe people think that shit is going to fly. Its embarrassing anyone thinks that is the reason as if Bayern can't afford to keep the player they offered those wages.  Just get a grip. Please. All of you. You think you know what you're talking about and I feel like I'm arguing with Trump fans who can clearly see the answer in front of their faces but refuse to accept they're wrong. It's ridiculous any of you think it's financial. If he was good enough they'd pay him that wage and gladly keep him. Uh…..okay? He's a major downgrade Is he even a minor upgrade? Disregarding the economic aspect. I like Tah but like isn't he equal to De Ligt at best? Happy to be corrected. Sure. Wanna make a bet? De Ligt (assuming he transfers to United) will be here at least for the duration of his first contract.  If he does, you will wear the Dutch flair for a year. How is ETH at fault for Lindelof when he was signed under Mourinho? Same with Maguire who was signed under Ole.  MDL is better than both. So really again, you have 0 idea of what you’re talking about. Dude just go support city. What?  Why would I take that bet? At no point did I say we'd sell him. I said he'd make us worse.   We won't sell him. Of course we won't. That's the United way. Buy these overrated shit players. Offer them far too much in wages. Make them impossible to sell.  I'll gladly take that bet if it's us finishing with less points than last season or EtH being sacked before Xmas. Two statements I'll gladly stand by. For keeping them. Again, an obvious answer.  Same reason he's keeping Rashford and Sancho and Anthony and Onana.  Because he's a fucking clueless idiot.  ""Financially"" we can't afford to keep any of these players. Let's play the financially game. Let's take a look at why EtH and United aren't getting rid of players for financial reasons when we're struggling because these players are shit and are stealing a living.  Why is it okay to say Bayern are getting rid of players for financial reasons but we've got to praise EtH for keeping ours?   No. I'm not having it. The man is an idiot. >I'll gladly take that bet if it's us finishing with less points than last season  Against this I'd bet on. You clearly have some really really weird hatred towards ETH.   You need to talk to a therapist or get some help. Some man you don’t even know is making you this angry I wouldn’t even want to interact with you in real life.  Hope your friends and family feel the same way Lol. A Reddit psychiatrist with serious delusions of grandeur.  I've never seen that before.  It's an opinion about football, lol. You seriously need to get a grip. There are far more important things in life. Why do you think I care about any of this so much that you think I ""hate"" these people, lol? I don't even hate Liverpool and City because that would be incredibly childish and I regularly laugh at idiot fans who act like the other team is an enemy. I couldn't care less about any of them, lol. It's a sport, you gimp.   Get outside more, please."
