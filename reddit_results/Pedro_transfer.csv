Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* I was starting to get worried, it‚Äôs past 3:00pm, and Chelsea still hadn‚Äôt made their daily signing. Now I can relax. How are they gonna give everyone minutes This one actually makes sense in that we play Wolves away in our second game this season, and we have just made that a more favorable matchup by buying their player. I see the vision, only 18 more signings to go. Another day, another Chelsea transfer. Just incredible at this point. good for chelsea, squad was getting too thin Do they really need another super injury-prone player? Suits Maresca‚Äôs style of play as he likes direct wingers.   The problem is that he can‚Äôt stay fit, missed 23 games last season and 27 the season before. Maresca everyday in training: Oi mate who the fuck are you?!! Might actually be the best club for him with all the options they'll have Since this image came out 4 days ago apparently Chelsea have signed 3 more players: https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1elm6zs/chelsea_squad_202425/ Damn 24 almost seems old by Chelsea standards these days Genuinely how are they affording this The first semi-solid player they signed this transfer window I'm happy we're targeting a senior player, but that much for an injury-prone player, ugh... Fuck football. Seriously. How are Chelsea still spending? This is ridiculous This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Chelsea have an illness lol Mendes cooking Chelsea are a human trafficking organisation I think Neto is a great player. But looking at this Chelsea team, I have no idea what the plan is. None of these players have similar profiles I don‚Äôt know why everyone‚Äôs making fun of our transfer strategy, it‚Äôs obviously genius: if no one else has any players then we‚Äôll win all of our games by default If you sign for Chelsea and never show up for training, block the staff and the manager on social media, then they'd never know you actually belong to the club. You can just sit at home and earn easy money for 7 years. Infinite money glitch. What's even the planned frontline at this point? Signings will be made until morale improves That's not a bad fee for Neto provided he can stay fit. omg ew a 24 year old , what a shit transfer   jk i am hyped How do they convince these players to sign for them is my question. If I was a player and a saw a team with 70 players no way in hell I sign for them. Genuine question, how are Chelsea not being absolutely pummeled by FFP? HOW.  ANSWER ME It's all fun and games until they actually sign a first teamer. The year is 2050 every player is signed with Chelsea, and loaned out to other clubs Chelsea are absolutely cooking the system but a lot of people don't seem to understand that the fees aren't just going into the book as red for this season. A ¬£60m player whos on a 5 years contract would be a ¬£12m a year cost on the books, some of their players were amortized over 8 years before that loophole was plugged but I think the ones they got through are grandfathered in.  I still don't get how they're doing it because of the shear amount of business/incomings they're getting and because of how massive their wage bill must be but the the amounts against each year for transfer fees are probably less than people think.   At the very least I have to imagine they'll be needing to continue bringing in ¬£100m+ PSR money to keep it all moving every year, which isn't a guarantee, if they have one money where they can't make a lot of profit I feel they could quickly run into trouble. Huh? Out of no where Tbf, unlike about 90% of transfers they make atm, this one does actually improve Chelsea. He‚Äôs better than Mudryk and Madueke, and some would argue he‚Äôs better than Sterling aswell. Only negative about the deal for Chelsea is his injury record. But if he can stay, it could end up being a good signing. Who needs to rotate and manage minuted for players when you can have 500 players and just play the 11 that are fit at the same time. Going to be super tough to make it into the Chelsea 2025 Calendar this year. On the plus, everyone can buy their players back cheaper when this all blows up in their faces. Time to sell another hotel Isn't his main position RW? A position where Palmer will play because Nkunku will be at 10 and they have Madueke on the bench? Who are they buying tomorrow? Chelsea about to be renamed ""Frustrated with lack of playing time"" FC Gunna have to find a few more hotels to sell to themselves Yeah I heard Chelsea were lacking good right wingers We need and deserve a transfer ban. Seriously, lol. There‚Äôs ZERO chance Chelsea won‚Äôt get massive point deductions and/or other sanctions in the near future. This must backfire sooner than later¬† This is actually a decent signing for them tbh, assuming he stays fit. With how good Rodrigo Gomes and chiquinho have looked I‚Äôm not fussed about this sale. Such an incredible player for us but way too many injury issues.   Hope to invest it in  a solid left winger and maybe a midfielder and cb.   Wolves gonna surprise people this year. Chelsea really need another injury prone player .. at least he's good I guess When Chelsea go bankrupt I‚Äôll be crying tears of joy Wow amazing actual quality 1st team player....   In the same position as their star player from last season, marvellous! Sad, but think it‚Äôs probably best to cash in now given his injury record. I also wonder how he‚Äôll do in a more possession based side, considering he‚Äôs at his best counterattacking and running at players. If you told me a few years ago I would be praying for my own club to get a transfer ban, I‚Äôd call you a lunatic. But here we are‚Ä¶ The memes keep writing themselves Is the plan for sales to just peddle enough bullshit in the media that eventually rumours just become true? There's surely no way they can either afford to spend like this without breaking rules or give these players even half the playing time they would want or expect? I watch a lot of football.  Couldn‚Äôt name Chelsea‚Äôs starting XI if my life depended on it.   Just a casual ¬£300M+ summer transfer window from them. Is this the Mudryk experiment over? 70m down the drain there, good stuff Can‚Äôt wait for the 7 bullshit reports per day of ‚ÄúNEWCASTLE WANT MADUEKE‚Äù as the Chelsea media shills actively try to drive him out of the club Actual disgusting club Okay that was fucking fast That was fast Seen this described as reckless and I think that is quite accurate. Surely must be better options than another injury prone player. Just Osimhen left to sign and Chelsea are done this window They‚Äôve made the premier league, and their punishments of Everton and Forest, look like absolute fools. An actual decent player who can slot in first team? Instead of a 19 year old brazilian? Is clearlake going sane? üò≤ Chelsea locker room gonna be hella crowded Under 25, so he just barely makes the cut One starting 11 for each competition. People don‚Äôt hate Chelsea enough because they‚Äòre shit but Shady Finances FC have been a cancer to football for too long now. Why are they still buying players, theyre just digging a deeper hole for themselves, they already owe about 200m in amortisation costs every season He'd be worth the money if it wasn't for the fact he stays injured for half a season. Means wolves are signing someone/people from Chelsea for 50 million chelsea are a disgrace Chelsea deserve whatever is coming to them, rarely seen ownership so clueless. It's not even that this is a bad signing, he's a good player but these fuckers are all over the place signing anything that moves every year, no consistency no continuity just throwing shit and hoping it sticks. This is actually a signing for Chelsea that will improve their current 11 for once.  Maybe after pissing away another ‚Ç¨80+ million on young players with 20 appearances combined they'll sign a striker that's good or a CB that's half decent. 63 million for a player who has 11 league goals in 5 seasons at wolves and is super injury prone Where are we getting all this money out of Hey FFP wanna do something about this? I know everyone is joking here, but on a serious note, what is their strategy here? How is that legal, sustainable, or fair in any way? They spend billions and still have no sporting success, so they spend even more and more, throwing dozens of players at a wall, hoping that one or two stick. This ruins this sport so much, and all people do is joke about it. Gonna spend a season crocked there. Redundant signing. Squad is a mess [deleted] What a laughable football club.¬† That was quick. Fucking  helll This week on Londons biggest hoarders‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ How are they not breaking any rules with all these signings? Wow that's a surprising move I am not sure if I understand what Chelsea is doing but I am very intrigued. X-fer window used to be my favorite time of the year, wondering which player we were gonna (over)pay for. Now I'm just numb... Sodom was smited for displaying less greed than this Bruh what  How  Where does this money keep coming from  Also, why would he even want to go there at this point  They really are buying a player a day aren't they Oh thank god. was genuinely extremely concerned for chelsea‚Äôs winger situation until I heard this üò≠ Chelsea‚Äôs transfer strategy reminds me of someone who buys things from an infomercial for 5 installments of $20, saying it‚Äôs a bargain but eventually all that money has to be paid What the fuck! This came out of nowhere! When can we start expecting chelsea to challenge for the title considering they‚Äôre spending the gdp of Malawi every year on transfers? PSR does not exist? I‚Äôm not sure on how I feel about this tbh The Chelsea clown-tourbus keeps on going Good player but oh boy this club has no idea üòÇ 60m on a player who's injured as much as Reece James. Blimey. Surely wingers are the last place they need coverage right? How do you get any cohesion here. Do chelsea know that you cant make 11 subs at halftime like you can in friendlies? What a signing. superb talent if he remains injury free Chelsea fans, how does it feel when you sign players now? It‚Äôs such a common occurrence, I‚Äôd imagine it gets boring, no? someone take their hotels away to protect them from themselves I have to say good Signing Our left Wing is sorted now. Only Need Victor Osimhen needed 63 is heavy Ok seriously what are we doing guys Their wage bill must be fucking insane. I hope this ends in a massive disaster for them It's funny how the owners/directors have managed to unify pretty much every football fan in complete confusion and contempt towards what they're doing, including Chelsea fans. It's probably safe to say that even Chelsea fans are hoping to be hit with FFP soon just so the madness can end and we might be forced into focusing on the many players we do have. What a dumb signing for both parties lol.  Chelsea don‚Äôt need to spend that much on another forward and Neto struggles with minutes due to injuries anyway so will barely play What the fuck. Russian oligarchs and petrol states take notes, this is how you conduct transfer business HehehehehwHAHAHAHAHAHA Chelsea's purchasing reminds me of the housing situation in 07-08 We need a Boeing 737 to fit our squad Another $200m window what the fuck Now they'll try to sell Chalobah to balance the book, after the book is balanced they'll try to spend even more money PSR seems like a totally legit thing  30 signings, 0 trophies In the seven deadly sins, Chelsea definitely represent gluttony Dumb af signing. Why the fuck would he want to join that shitshow of a club I'm gonna go cry real quick What is Chelsea's amortized spending at now? Must be close to 150 mil no? I dont understand these guys. Wut I ask again‚Ä¶.why not spend this money on a top striker (osimhen, Alvarez, Isak etc).   Signing another winger is moving mad Must be nice not having PSR apply to you.  Gonna need to sell themselves another womans team and a hotel before the end of the year. There is no plan at this club.  Just keep signing players and managers until something bubbles up to the surface. As a Chelsea fan I don‚Äôt understand anymore someone please help me understand. How many signings have Chelsea made this window? My god Place your bets for who's coming or going tomorrow right here Just out of curiosity, how many wingers do they have now? What exactly is Chelsea's long term squad building plan? It's funny that Chelsea seems to be taking Dortmund's approach of buy young, sell high. But instead are going buy high while they're young, fuck up their careers, then sell them for the same price or cheaper.  But I'll let a Chelsea fan tell me how they're definitely recouping over a billion spent on a few loan players that no one knows and never got a chance. If he stays healthy, he is quality Why is it in ‚Ç¨? Two English teams. Seems like even a top tier journalist like Orny wants to inflate fees for clicks. Wtf is Chelsea‚Äôs starting 11 gonna be when they sign this many players lol. First ever soccer club who play starting 22 in history.  Starting 11 is not for chelsea Fuck off this shit is stupid Surely we have to be witnessing some of the worst business ever in the prem by chelsea over the last few years. This new manager signing everyone to 7+ year contracts is crazy and they have 8 goalies wtf What the hell is wrong with this football club Shit. That's an actually good signing. Jackson will have to return back to playing whatever other sport he used to play because it sure wasn't football. Aaaaaaand injured Squad is now [44](https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/men) & counting. Talk about squad depth! When are they going to get charged Hospital FC Noooooo fuck. Why'd they have to get this baller? Chelsea's transfer policy is to sign everyone so that each player kills one another for their position and only the strongest survives. Lmao you can't make this shit up As an Arsenal fan, srsly annoyed at how slow we get players over the line when you see other clubs moving quick like this FFS would 3m addons really be a deal breaker if they're getting 60m up front? i dont get this structure of payment. its like being able to afford a house in cash but still locking yourself into a tiny loan agreement to cover the final 5% of the fee just because If I have understood Chelsea correctly, some of their player will be going to Wolves for inflated price.  I am guessing Broja for 25m, which would be like 15m inflated Would seriously not be surprised if Boehly was unaware of registration limits 24yo is gonna be a like a grandpa on this squad. let me guess its a 7 year contract? ""PL money doesn't exist"" Absolute fraudulence What the hell. Chelsea with infinite money glitch. HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?!?!?!?!?!? Paper hamstrings Step 1. Buy as many players as you can Step 2. Loan them back to their home clubs Step 3. Profit? We laugh and are confused, but there are actual qualified people making these decisions aren't there? I don't mean the owners, I mean the scouts, the staff, whoever is in charge of transfer policy. Nearly every day it feels like for years, during summer and January it's like Chelsea have signed another player no one has any idea where they fit in. It really feels like now someone from the club should be explaining the logic. They make the job impossible for any manager. Please a transfer ban is all I need I'm available Chelsea, sign me. lmao Absolutely ridiculous I'm starting to think that Todd Boehly and co. Are trying to bankrupt Chelsea for some kind of compensation package; none of this makes sense any more... So that's why he was called up to the NT. Makes sense now! Money laundering machine let's go!!! Good, Chelsea made a signing today Are Chelsea moving to NFL or something with the squad they are accumulating? Collecting players like Pokemon, gotta catch‚Äôem all The same Chelsea that‚Äôs buying all the kindergarten kids? I like him but I don‚Äôt know how Chelsea justify that price with all his injuries and all the attacking options they already have Someone tell Chelsea to buy an Engineer from India. They're trained to warm benches anyway. Player wins, Chelsea enters a new market. It's a win - win. Is that not how this works? Do Chelsea Fans even know the names from all their players? üßÇüßÇüßÇ Loving these tears Chelsea have spent all this money and yet I‚Äôm somehow more concerned about West Ham being a threat. Shows just how terrible Boehly has been. Boehly probably does a line of coke and decides to make a new transfer just for the fun of it, then once he comes to his senses later on, decides to  buy a parking lot or a hotel that Chelsea owns to balance the books. At this rate they'll have more first team  players than fans So glad Poch was able to get out of this situation. what are they going to do with all those extra players they have amassed? Someone needs to take the credit card off Todd.  I‚Äôm happy to get Neto, he‚Äôs great but I don‚Äôt understand how we fit all these lads into the system.  It‚Äôs like Potter 2.0, overloaded with players. He‚Äôs an upgrade on the winger options we have now but he‚Äôs got an injury record as bad as Reece James. This is a panic buy. Challenging City for the 115 score Chelsea are like a dog who every time you turn your back it's trying to eat something it shouldn't be, but instead every time you look away they are spaffing millions up the wall on yet another new signing Are you fucking kitten me?! Roughly 35 league games missed in two seasons and only two league goals in the same period.   Plenty of red flags but if his hamstrings can last he‚Äôll be one of their better signings. Screw Chelsea. Abhorrent management running the club. This is an absolute farce.  How is this legal and legit? God I hate them so much Sure ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§° Letting these idiots spend a billion every year without punishment while Everton and Nottingham get point deductions left, right and center. Why? Why? These clueless clowns Good signing. Bit much for my liking but he's a quality LW who makes the team better. Just surprised Is it just me or do Wolves look like they're about to drop like a hammer? Finally a good transfer!! Great signing for them Genuinely feels like we're signing at least a player a day recently.   The club said they wanted the majority of their incomings to be done before pre-season started. Yet they're going absolutely insane after we've finished our tour. (Maybe not surprising given what a disaster it has been) A signing I've heard of, with little to no drama that isn't dragged out for weeks, that's over the age of 21 and, actually makes our team better. All for a reasonable price? Impossible. Can't be us.   Hopefully he can play on the left though, because I'm not sure how else he gets in. And his injury record does concern me, although it'll help him fit right in at Chelsea unfortunately... with Richarlison staying at Spurs, you can see why Neto has chosen Chelsea.   - now, not a guaranteed starter because he sees Kulu and Johnson there. - perceived notion the Kulu plays RW (when in fact Ange is pushing him into a shadow striker) - therefore, I get paid more at Chelsea to be a probable starter, rather than get paid less for a probable starter at Spurs.(most likely)   Spurs get stumped on these targets a lot. I think he's a quality player and Spurs have made a mistake. He is a really good player suited for a 3-4-3 as an inside winger. If he stays fit Chelsea can challenge for top 4. I DONT HAVE ANY MORE DOPAMINE MAKE IT STOP Hello, can any Wolves fan or anyone in the know tell me what to expect and if this is good. Because I haven't watched him closely and from sats of 5/6 games per goal and 3.5 games per assist, it doesn't look that great. Genuinely asking. Thanks. That was quick lol üòÇ maybe we sell them Broja the other way lol üòÇ they have been interested for time Not past 3 pm in the UK! They're right on time My watch has ended. For today Relax? We are buying players past their prime. A 24yo with no resale value? SMH my head I wonder who they will sign tomorrow How many players have the signed??? Half the squad will be injured by November no worries¬† They are gonna divide the starting 11 by 3 teams and alternate them every 3 games. Strasbourg is about to get a whole new starting 11 Point of this signing is most likely that they don't have to give Mudryk and Sterling too many minutes lol Yes [removed] People are exaggerating with Chelseas transfers, their actual line-up would be:  Nkunku(Jackson/Omorodion/Guiu)   Sterling(Mudryk)  Palmer  Neto(Madueke)  Lavia(Caicedo)  Enzo(Dewsberry-Hall)  Cucurella(Gusto)  Colwill(Badiashille)  Fofana(Disasi/Tosin)   James(Gusto)  Jorgensen(Sanchez)  Ideally loan out one of Guiu/Omorodion, because they have 3 strikers.   Ideally offload Chalobah because right now they have 5 CB's for 2 spots. But what could also happen is we see Enzo playing a CB as FB in the middle of the season (similar to Pep and Arteta). They already build with 3 at the back with one of the FB playing as a CB.  The rest of the players fill up squad places or are not part of their plans and will be sold/loaned by the end of the market. He‚Äôll be fit for like 15 games anyway. Play 10 wingers and a goalkeeper. In fact just put a winger in goal too. Loan them to us (Manchester United). mudryk or sterling gotta be on the way out Everyone gets a minute each. They been conceding goals like fuck and they buy a winger hahahaha‚Ä¶.put your bets on for Maresca to be first manager sacked before Xmas‚Ä¶ Many players they currently have will be loaned/sold. This signing was actually important because they had no rotation option for Madueke as RW except an out of position Mudryk. That's the neat part.... Loans, loans, and more loans. They won't/can't and when the manager leaves after 9 months there will be even more players stuck in the Chelsea Limbo. Yes Using the infamous loan army Easy: Jackson gets zero minutes. The bigger question is:  What kind of counseling are these players receiving? These kids are moving to squads with at least 2 to 3 young signings at every position. Why do any think it's a good idea? League and cup squads. 24+palmer each. I don‚Äôt think Boehly realizes you can use the same players each.   Why the conference league will have Cold Palmer but the prem squad will have Cole Palmer. Bro what in the fuck are they gonna do??? Are they gonna start a second club and play their way up through the ranks to the Prem?? They can't even register all the players for PL! My guess is that BlueCo is about to buy another club and they're purchasing some of these players in anticipation of ""stocking the shelves."" They've already tried to expand and buy teams in other countries. It's not *just* Strasbourg;  last year, from what I remember, there were rumours of attempted acquisitions for teams in the Eredivisie and South America. They won't lmao.   Actually insane how much they've already spent. They have one outgoing which it T Silva, they already signed 3 players for about 80 mil, now between this and the keeper we are looking at 150 already. Each player gets another player to hop on their shoulders. Bottom player uses his feet and  top player uses his head, so it's not against the rules. No need to look it up. They'll sell players to Saudi You forget - Chelsea aren't a football club anymore, they're an investment fund. If you think of each player signing as an investment from someone who doesn't care about football, it makes more sense.  Couldn't have happened to a more deserving, piss weak, racist club with no real history to speak of. Kevin de Bruyne (back) to Chelsea, here we go! Damn good strategy, buying good player from other clubs so these players wont destroy us anymore, this is what we have done with Cucurella, Caicedo and now Pedro Neto. Also never sell out players to EPL club and just sell to Aletico Madrid, now the strategy makes sense lmao We've got them first game of the season so thanks for that haha Cunha questionable for that game too, so yeah it‚Äôll be quite hard for us to get something out of the game. Although Rodrigo Gomes is looking quite good in pre season. When do we play?  Just wondering if you‚Äôre going to wait until January window to sign Antony Scott McTominay to Chelsea here we go Why does Chelsea, the largest team, not simply buy the other teams? Are you forgetting there's a January window? Everyone else is proper shitting themselves over wages/ffp but Chelsea just continue as normal.   Proper weird setup. My sources say Boehly first came to Strasbourg with an offer to buy some players, but they said ""double it and give it to the next club"" Absolutely. Especially left footed attackers who like to play off the right. Real gap there Squad‚Äôs been thin ever since the Hazard transfer.  :drumroll: They almost dropped below 45 players, they had to get him in ASAP. I don't know, still feel like there is not enough depth But they will never field 11 keepers if this way. Boehly got confused and has been trying to field enough players for an American football team. Saw that starting 11 and thought they still needed to sign defense and special teams. Serious question, how many players do they currently have?? Good thing they have depth to cover for him Yes we do! So we can sign another injury prone player as his replacement I want to know what going through their mind. 63 mil for a player with his injury record is crazy Injury prone because we need him for the full 90 mins every game when he is fit and he gives his all every game. With Chelsea he will be able to rest which should reduce his injuries. One player will play from Aug-Nov, next will play Nov-Feb and the last will play from Feb-May Maybe the injury prone part is part of their plan to ensure everyone gets minutes?¬† The plan is simple. Have a squad of 60 super injury prone players and your odds of being able to actually field a team become a lot better. Way fewer performance bonuses paid out as well if every player only plays 120 minutes each The have like 8 players who can play RW, and they‚Äôll all play 4-5 games Don‚Äôt worry, only paying him 60m üòÇ That sounds even worse than not being able to stay fit, that's more like occasionally taking a break from the physio to kick the ball a bit. Missed over 100 games in the last 4 seasons. Lol what are Chelsea thinking You even missed out the season before. He's played 3000 minutes in the last 3 seasons with just 36 starts from the last 114 PL games.  And that doesn't include the end of the 20/21 season where he missed the last 7 games as well. Just pulled the stats in the five years he‚Äôs played in the Prem. Featured in 60% of games in those five seasons. Featured in just 45% of games in the last three seasons.   He was so desperately needed as Wolves struggled to generate an attack so often in those seasons. If he was healthy, he would have played. is he not a right winger? Chelsea best player is also a rw Wait wolves didn't have european football last season  right? So he missed 23 out of 38 league games + cup?   Not able to stay fit is an understatement lol Ha!  Boehly would see that as an opportunity to buy player for low fees and lower salary for 7 years. There is a win somewhere there, which we mere mortals can‚Äôt see *""I've just turned up this morning and there are 12 new players. Help.""* Malang Sarr: ""Here we go again"" poch with malang sarr Plus if he's injured he'll have plenty of pals to hang out with in the medical centre! Where did this Neto deal come from? Seemed to materialize out of thin air. Chelsea are about to create 19 more teams and form their own league at this point Rb looking a bit light¬† How is enzo vice captain of that team lmao 24 players in that image will be first team players this season, adding 3 more players and getting rid of one is a good squad size for a team that could easily play 70 games in the 12 months. 15 of those players will be sold or loaned Mate by Chelsea'a standards he's standing on the edge of the grave And Drake‚Äôs standards‚Ä¶.allegedly The Dicaprio test [They've sold 100m in transfers so far, and that doesn't include Conor, and only 129m in incomings (that have been officially signed). I'm sure there are 3 or 4 that haven't been added to that total yet.](https://www.transfermarkt.us/fc-chelsea/transfers/verein/631/saison_id/2024)  Plus, the had those sketchy sales of hotels and training grounds and the women's team.    They're probably flying very close to the sun right now. Maatsen, Hutchison, Hall, Gallagher are close to 150M in sales. I need to know this too. They‚Äôre already like -¬£100m in the red playing Conference league this season. This whole system seems so stupid to me. Because they are good at selling.  They offed Mount and Havertz for 100m last year.  This year they've offed hall and Gallagher for 70m and im sure they've made other sales that I can't remember off the top of my head to get them over 100m again. Boehly is worth billions. My question is, how do they comply with FFP? I assume it's because of the length of the contracts and amortization and all that, but who knows? ¬£1.5 billion debt was wiped when the takeover happened which gave them an unfair advantage in PSR compared to everyone else. That and accounting loopholes. The rules are resetting for next season no? If that‚Äôs the case I think they‚Äôre just saying fuck psr for this season and taking the hit. Those Conference League riches Up until the last few signings (of which it's hard to keep track) we were actually making money this window on sales/signings. And that's not including the Gallagher deal, plus hopefully ones for Chalobah, Broja, Kepa, Lukaku etc. say what you want about us spunking money up the wall, but we sell high too.   Well it's that, and also all the dodgy shit we do with hotels that help ...   (Plus the financial fair play rules being awfully implemented to begin with) Selling Chelsea real estate to boley, they can do what they want. He's good, but that injury history for 60m? Big big risk Who‚Äôs injured more often than not Dewsbury Hall is a good player. I think Jorgensen is OK too Oh don't worry, they'll fuck his career up too Every time I watch Wolves he's the danger man. He's got absolutely no desire to use his right foot but it doesn't seem to matter, his left is magic. (Classic left footed player) Not good enough to actually make a change. We have like a dozen of decent wingers already, and we buy ANOTHER instead of actually being a player in a position we need (that isn't a 16-year-old) Just be happy they've gone back to the ""overpaying for promising U-25 player"" strategy. If these clowns spent this 54 million on 3 new Brazilian children with 20 senior apps between them I would've lost it Agreed but 60m is still a very good deal for you guys, especially for an inury prone player Honestly I'm happy with it.   I love Neto, but he's injury prone and ¬£50m is ¬£50m. Hobbs reinvested the Nunes money very well last season, and I'm looking forward to seeing how he can reinvest this money too. They'll basically start every season massively in the red and in need of selling. I'm guessing their plan is that in the short term, their academy keeps producing talents they can sell for pure profit, and in the long term they hope some of these youngsters they bought become world beaters.  It's an insane strategy though and turns a football club into a glorified VC firm rather than something the fans can be proud of. Every single day there is a new player, its beyond ridiculous. You have to ask why players are coming still as well: walking into this bloated sqaud, new manager, conference league European football. From the outside looking in its a mad house Because PSR is a joke. Sell a hotel to yourself and bam, you can buy more players.  Wanting academy talents to stay and develop at their clubs? Nah fuck that, who cares about identity. Sell one academy player and buy 10 foreign youngsters instead!  Or why not sell a player to another club for a made up number while they do the same. Pure profit! Nothing to see here.  There are so many loopholes it might as well not exist for some clubs. Thanks Gwen Stefani. Y'all got any more of those expensive injury-prone wingers It's prime day everyday for chels I don‚Äôt recall him having such a big summer window, insane really. Mans going to buy a new yacht when he's done. Not a bad strategy, to be honest. Buy all the players. All of them. Then, when in 6 months you hire your new manager, they can just pick the players that fit their style and play those! No more worries about the manager having to adjust their style to players available to them, or about having to bring new faces in, they'll already be there! LW probably cos Sterling is so far over the hill and Mudryk is Mudryk I swear the manager has no say in the transfers. I thought this a year ago but it's absolutely apparent now: they are run by a private equity fund and they are borrowing their transfer strategy from the type of ""diversification"" thats preached in finance  The idea is you don't rely too heavily on getting every single decision right. Instead, you make many bets to maximize your chances of hitting on a few of them (and so that no single investment is crucial to your success)  They're also banking on the fact that there's so much money in football that they can offload failed transfers without incurring total losses.  It might be nuts, but this is the kind of shit I saw in my investment banking days. Finance bros with MBAs trying to apply their theories to everything. i think the plan is this; just buy a load of random players, incurring massive losses, and hope that somehow your championship manager can miraculously make them compete in the worlds most competitive league before being sacked in 10 months I thought your lot were in for him, what happened to that? Palmer will probably play more central so we only have Noni as a RW That is the plan apparently, to get different profiles of players to give the manager a lot of flexibility and options. Yeah wish that was how it worked. All new 4-4-9 formation. Random number generator¬† Neto on the left, Palmer on the right, Nkunku in the middle and Jackson/Osimhen upfront depending on how this transfer shapes up I guess.¬†             Jackson     Neto - Nkunku - Enzo - Palmer        Caicedo/Lavia - Gusto      Cucurella Colwill Fofana  First game of the season since Reece is banned. Yes Huge if given his history That‚Äôs a big big if. Wolves making a tidy profit along with their Killman sale, their PSR should be very healthy now.   A win for Wolves but seriously Chelsea how the fuck you going to play ALL these wingers? You needed a striker right? Save that money for Oshimen? Just a thought. 24 year winger with 2 goals and 9 assists last season and big injury record for 60 mil is not bad? You give that money to Beppe Marotta and he makes a squad competing for the title in a year. This guy is not even guaranteed to bench the bastion of players they have already. That seems unlikely: https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/pedro-neto/verletzungen/spieler/487465   According to that he has missed 126 games in the last 6 years Narrator: he can‚Äôt Well I don't know about that, but I read from multiple sources that he was available for around 45 pounds (because of the injury record) . Wouldn't surprise me Chelsea offered 60 as the opening bid. Better wages + you don‚Äôt become a top tier professional athlete without a bit of an ego so you‚Äôre not worried about squad size because you believe you‚Äôll show your good enough to play every week Because many of those players will be gone in a few weeks. Amazing to me how people actually fall for clickbait posts that have Lukaku, Anjorin, and a bunch of academy players in a 24/25 squad. There will be a lot of games to go around. Deep cup runs, conference league, and club world cup. If you‚Äôre being offered triple or even quadruple your wages on a 7 year deal, you‚Äôd probably be a lot easier to convince With lots of zeros behind the first number on the cheque. I guess Mendes is the one deciding and his players  (except the superstars) have absolutely no say in where they go‚Ä¶ Money! ¬†They pay great wages¬† - Premier League  - London  - Big club  - Long contracts  - club will let players leave if they want to for the right price, we talent horde but we dont hold on too long.  - odds are professional footballers back themselves to think they can make the first team or at the very least get minutes. They'll run out of hotels and training grounds to sell soon. [They've sold 100m in transfers so far, and that doesn't include Conor, and only 128m in incomings (that have been officially signed). I'm sure there are 3 or 4 that haven't been added to that total yet.](https://www.transfermarkt.us/fc-chelsea/transfers/verein/631/saison_id/2024)  Plus, the had those sketchy sales of hotels and training grounds and the women's team.    They're probably flying very close to the sun right now. Amortisation and selling hotels! selling academy products is huge for FFP. FFP is a very dumb system You see we also sell players What‚Äôs your manager done? You know that shiny new LB you guys recently bought? > A ¬£60m player whos on a 5 years contract would be a ¬£12m a year cost on the books,   but 5 ¬£60 million players over 5 years is 60 mil a year for 5 years :D Ornstein hitting us like an RKO. A unique player for every week üòÇüòÇ Yes. He plays both sides if my googling is right. Clearlake are selling academy players for 100% profit. They know what they‚Äôre doing, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be sanctioned but I think the PL will rewrite the laws on this sort of spending loophole [deleted] That would be true if PSR wasn't an absolute joke that makes no sense. All the young players they routinely buying are not cheap. They cost at least 20 million per player. I don't know if those young players they bought don't live up to their potential and they can't get much money from them. If there's anything you can count on for an American super corporation it's knowing financial loopholes. The fact people go to university for 4 years just to learn one part of the tax code is all you need to know. Even after they graduate they still gotta get their license to do taxes [deleted] I'm convinced that every year like 30 players just spawn out of nowhere in their squad. They have 7 goalkeepers, 14 black defenders, 18 wonderkid midfielders and like 7 attackers, 4 of which are either constantly injured or on loan in Strasbourg. Looks like it, wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if we loan him maybe not this season but he has been a flop unfortunately Maybe they'll use villa for a bit to give you guys a break Half a season would be a blessing for him. Apparently he's only been available for 27% of the games while at Wolves. Problem is his injury history. Lot of money for someone who‚Äôs only available like 30% of your games Have you taken into consideration his football ability That's insane. Didn't know he was so unproductive. Now watch us offer him 150k+ salary and then say, we walked away from Olise bacuse he was too expensive. I'd have absolutely loved Neto with us,  hopefully it doesn't work out for them haha. A little jealous ngl. It's definitely a risk but when fit Neto would probably start for any Prem team on that left hand side. Also he'd go for more than 60m if his fitness wasn't in question. He‚Äôs unreal you‚Äôre smoking craic Sold 100mil worth of players (just Maatsen, Hall, and Hutchinson). Plus the sale of hotel/training grounds with whatever years they are added to. > what is their strategy here?  That implies they have one People talk about Oil clubs but Chelsea is causing way more damage to the sport than PSG or City ever did. They snap up every talented youngster, have zero plans for their development except sending them on loan to Strasbourg, and do not have any plans to give them consistent minutes to improve because they‚Äôll sign someone else in the same position.   They‚Äôre literally destroying the next generation of football players.  This is a signing that doesn‚Äôt come into that category but like you said, someone needs to intervene and stop this. I say send him to any bundesliga team. Maybe Dortmund and see if someone bites after a (hopefully) decent season there It does. Chelsea's sold like 100mil worth already (Hall, Maatsen, Hutchinson). This doesn't even include Gallagher or Chalobah or Broja. Plus any others they might do (like Lukaku off the wage book or potentially Chilwell).  Ziyech, Sarr, and Silva are also off the squad with their wages too. IF he stays healthy, I think it‚Äôs a fantastic signing. But it‚Äôs a massive ‚ÄòIf‚Äô Chelsea's wage bill is actually not that bad. Sterling/Chilwell are the two anomalies before the new wage structure was in place (Lukaku too, but very heavily being pushed to leave). The wage build has been cut by 25-30% yearly ""We need a Boehly 737 to fit our squad.""  Fixed it for you. 250 a year or so  If you are talking about player amortization Chelsea is profitable and is generating cash flow with their sales needed a chaperone Boehly has nothing to do with transfers or contracts and hasn‚Äôt for some time. Try to keep up. What are all the lads for winger? Currently we have Sterling, Mudryk, Madueke.  Then we have Palmer and Nkunku that can be wingers or attacking mids. Neto makes 6 for 2 wing spots and an attacking mid.   Then Jackson can cover wing (if needed). KdH and Carney can cover attacking mid. 5 subs. Euro conference. And prior seasons of dealing with a lot of injuries. he scored 8 goals in the past 4 years, that's pretty bad Everton and Forest should simply just make more money. 60 million for a player that is starting less than half the games every season is a lot of money. There's a reason Arsenal and Spurs didn't pursuit it. His talent is undeniable. As much as his unavailability. He would have started above kulu and johnson without a doubt I think he has chosen Chelsea because Levy is cheap and never actually was in for Neto seriously With what defense And also they have made 2 today. Signed another GK right before this. Shake my head my head Gabriel Mec Yes And the rest will be at Strasbourg. And Neto will be one of them sadly Neto certainly will be. Love the player, wanted him at Arsenal once upon a time, but not his injury record. Tbf having the most amount of injuries is quite likely when you also have easily the most number of players >Half the squad will be injured by November no worries¬†   Which begs the question why Man Utd ain't doing the same. Wouldn‚Äôt Neto fit right in then? The other 2 teams can play each other. Problem solved. Aaah, so my FIFA manager mode strategy. Alter eating every game would be better, then they play 1, miss 2nd and 3rd game and play 4th. /s My Dream League Soccer tactic Strasbourg board celebrating everytime Chelsea sign another player What's happening to Strasbourg, is it the new Vitesse? ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs buy a 60m player so we don‚Äôt have to play two other players that cost 110m‚Äù Imagine spending 150m on 2 player and needing to buy new players because you don't want them to play too many minutes. I have a feeling this means one of those two will be sold. My guess it‚Äôs Sterling since his wages are so high. Neto also missed half the season‚Ä¶ Neto gets a lot of assists though.  Ok so from this you've left out  Lukaku  Broja  Angelo  Fofana  Deivid  Moreira  Casadei  Chukwuemeka  Ugochokwu  Veiga  Kepa  Petrovic  Bergstrom  Bettinelli Operation talent drain [it's working](https://i.imgur.com/rpnuBC1.png) I feel like we can always be a bit confident playing Chelsea these days. We've lost only once in our last 8 games against them (4 wins), won the last 3 with Hwang/Neto missing     We've beat them twice with Diego Costa and Fabio Silva upfront for  fuck's sake    The football gods have given us their number, to keep indefinitely based on that personally i cannot wait for full time wolves 4-0 chelsea after we draw against city playing good in the first game     as is tradition at this point I've just been told by the board that we will only move for Antony in the January window if our game in November results in a draw or loss, no chance of signing the Brazilian during this window as things stand. It actually doesn't make sense. How are they doing this?? to be fair they have been selling A LOT and their debt was completely wiped prior to the takeover, which goes a long long way... plus FFP only really kicks in after 3 seasons and this is Chelsea's 3rd full season under new management  I think we MIGHT be seeing a regression to mean from next summer going forward but at this point who knows Boom. Roasted. Who are also injury prone Infinite player glitch Cocaine Reece James wanted a friend. Mad bastards will be in for Naby Keita at this rate Maybe if he's a luxury player, they just want the upside while he's healthy.  I hate that idea though. > He was so desperately needed as Wolves struggled to generate an attack so often in those seasons. If he was healthy, he would have played.  I think that was part of the issue though. He's an incredible player so we'd get him back into the squad as quickly as we could and play him as regularly as we could.   Chelsea will be able to manage his minutes a little more, hopefully keeping him fit. Neto has played more games on the left than he's played on the right. Palmer will play as the 10 in Enzo's system, the wingers stay wide and hes much better playing centrally. No rumours at all. Very weird transfer. Right? I opened reddit and thought it was a joke Wolves are really good at keeping things under wraps, generally we get no rumors Its nice getting a truly out of nowhere transfer BOMBA for once! I've gotten so sick of seeing hourly updates from Here We Go Man and the rest Chelsea probably made a decision quickly, came in with a fair offer and Wolves accepted straight away. Todd got him on career mode and pulled the trigger. The first squad picture of the season will have to be an Arial shot with a drone. Cobham Cup Their AAA affiliate team is about to boss the Minor Leagues this year League gets canceled cause all of them are injured at the same time. Let's not kid ourselves. By Chelsea's standards, and Neto's injury history, he's not standing. He's in a wheelchair. Can you even fly if you're carrying so much baggage? These incomings doesn't count players like Estevan and Paez, both being fairly expensive The wage bill must be absolutely astronomical at this stage. That‚Äôs just transfer fees, what about wages for their 72 players Personally I think the plan is to fly close to the sun. This [comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1enxonl/comment/lh9usdk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)expanded on my point with more detail than I had What this doesn‚Äôt account for is the amortized fees from the last two seasons are continuous‚Ä¶ and after all they‚Äôve spent it‚Äôs like 150 million every year they have to make up for in sales‚Ä¶ that number will increase as they only sell academy players‚Ä¶ next summer it will be like 190 million in amortized fees they have to dig themselves out of‚Ä¶ Yeh but how many millions of installements do they owe every year from previous transfers?   Literally all chelsea fans ever say is ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôve spent X millions but we‚Äôre only paying X/5 million per year‚Äù. Well now is that year where they should all add up. Yes but it‚Äôs about the building yearly hit on the books. Since fixed assets like this as recognized over the span of their useful life, the yearly hit on the books is adding up.  Assuming they‚Äôre paying for all players with even payments split over 7 years for the last two windows, and 5 years for this window, they‚Äôre yearly hit on the books per year for the last 3 seasons is around 190M/ year.   That number keeps growing and will be harder to keep kicking the can on Selling Gallagher gives them a lot of leeway since he is academy/100% profit. Tebas wouldve lost his mind if they were in La Liga. Maatsen for another ¬£35mil and Omori Hutchinson too If you look at my comment below, they‚Äôre still around 600m in the red over the past three seasons  They‚Äôre incredible at selling unwanted players but their spending is absolutely ludicrous Maatsen and Hutchinson brought in additional 55M. That‚Äôs obviously what I‚Äôm saying lol  Chelsea fans will say they‚Äôre good at selling, which is true, and they‚Äôre good at producing homegrown players to sell, also true, but at some point there‚Äôs got to be a limit right? They‚Äôre ¬£250m in the hole from last season, ¬£400m the one before that, and then they‚Äôll be a good 60/70m in the red this season if they buy Neto and there‚Äôs still apparently more to come   It‚Äôs absolutely insane We sell hotels Length of contract been capped.  Selling home grown+ car park has helped.  We will see this year if they sell stadium to themselves or something Next summer they will sell Colwill and Reece James for pure profit to make sure to comply with FFP so they can continue to overspend on random players and moan they are forced into having to sell their academy guys Well they sell hotels and land to their other entities so they‚Äôve got that going for them Some mixture of amortisation and pure profit sales , this summer they‚Äôve sold Gallagher and Hutchinson for about 70 mil of pure profit   Chalobah should also be leaving and big earners like lukaku and kepa should also leave , all in all they‚Äôre at least breaking even if not in the green They don't. Ridiculous theory. Debt interest/repayments is not included in FFP. 60m euros tbf but still a lot of dough He's more than good shouldn't be throwing stones in glass houses my friend Look who‚Äôs talking üòÇüòÇüòÇ Let other fanbase banter us on that lmao I love when Man U fans don‚Äôt see any irony to their comments. I think in this case his hamstrings will do that for him sadly. Laughs in Sancho Well, we literally just signed a 19 year old Belgian keeper, does that count? We are branching out to other South American countries too, don‚Äôt worry. It's the same with us and Dani Olmo, fantastic player that you don't really want to let go but he gets injured a lot. theyve spent more than a billion and somehow dont seem to have improved whatsoever. its mind boggling how far theyve gone committing to this crackpot scheme with less than nothing to show for it American capitalist ideas are crushing football. If you‚Äôre American and this offends you, then feel free to aim this criticism at capitalist writ large. But American sports influence, with their giant arenas replacing actual football grounds, and ownership groups have had an undeniable influence.¬†  Glazers came in with leveraged buy and have been sucking the club dry like leaches. This Clearlake clown operation has completely distorted Chelsea, they‚Äôre an unrecognizable club from a few years ago.¬†¬†¬†  The obscenely rich oligarchs used to use football clubs as a safe place to put money out of reach of autocrats and as vanity projects. Now, they‚Äôre turning football clubs into VC ventures, or using them to white wash their politics/image.¬† ¬† ¬†  It‚Äôs all so completely fucked. This greedy, broken system leaves nothing to be enjoyed. If the sun shines on it, sooner than later a grubby greedy little shite with already far more wealth than they‚Äôll ever need will find a way to corrupt it, and suck it dry of any good it had in it.¬† Before they were a Russian oligarchs unprecedented play thing/money and reputation laundry, and before that the go to spot for BNP leaflets and approving chants on captain's whiteness -- whatever misguided pride?¬† Ah, but they did have it in all that -- good riddance indeed Correct. They have to make up for like 140-150 million in amortized yea after fees every fiscal year. A number which will be going up after this summer and winter window to like 190. It will hold there as they most likely will not sell anyone but academy players next summer. Real life Football Manager is a 24/7 life for them. I don't know what they re smoking. Aren‚Äôt you supposed to have 54 players on your team? Chelsea dir of football at the office: ""Hey! The new guy likes center backs that can carry the ball forward out of a back 3, we got anything?""  Chelsea assistant down the hall in a closet dusting off old players: ""Yea got a pair, but they haven't been used since 2022.""  DoF: ""Ahh that'll do. Clean em up and throw em outside for training in an hour."" Clearly doesn't This was made clear when the job title at Chelsea became ‚Äúhead coach‚Äù and not manager.¬† Managers rarely do, we aren't ik the 90s Nope. The manager shouldn't have a say.  Allowing the manager a voice in transfers is how you end up with completely different styles when one manager leaves and another comes in. he's a ""yes man"" by the looks of it I don‚Äôt think spurs wanted to pay the fee and offered a player plus cash and wolves said fuck off which is fair If Palmer goes central what happens to nkunku? Did they sign you too? Winston Bogarde showed us it was possible. Best hustler in the game. Big big big if if true  *taps head* Osimhen's wage demands are 400k/week. That's 20 million per year. In the world of Boehlynomics, that 20 million is the annual amortization value of 100 million spread over 5 years. Might as well spend that on a younger promising striker on low wages. We can't sign Osimhen in our current wage structure anyway. 2 goals and 9 assists in 20 games averaging 75 mins a game whild playing for wolves is good For a good example James Maddison played more games and minutes than Neto and has the same number of assists. Shitting on Neto stat wise is not well thought out. [deleted] When they bought the club they talked about a 4-window plan of mass spending. This is the 4th window so I imagine things will slow down a lot going forward....I hope The problem with Boehlyism is you eventually run out of hotels and training grounds to sell. You can‚Äôt sell Hotels, Women‚Äôs teams, and training grounds every year though. Theyre just one time Get-Out-of-Jail-Free cards It seems like they‚Äôre betting on just being able to continue to sell and churn, churn every season. ¬†It‚Äôs risky but kind of fascinating¬† That is true but it's more players for the 60 I guess üòÇ So 60m for an injury prone player who will be played out of position He was way more dangerous on the right Thing is that it's not really a loophole.  They buy players and amortise their cost over 5 years, with extra amortisation against them from previous years.  They sell academy players for profit this year. Next year they need to be able to sell more players just to match the amortisation they've built up already, and the year after that, and the year after that.  Their ability to develop and then sell players is what they're relying on and unless they want to get into dodgy territory (which tbf they already have with hotels etc)  they are basically committed to having to sell players for years now with the additional restriction that players they've bought in might not be financially viable to sell. I do wonder what the plan will be when the stricter loan regulations come into play. Doesn't exactly help build transfer value to have players absolutely nowhere near first team football and even youth squads will be absolutely saturated now.   Wouldn't be surprised to see them organising friendlies throughout the season soon to keep the players not in the squad more visible to the market. But the other sanctions will absolutely ruin them. It's fine receiving a 10 or deduction if you're City, Arsenal or even Liverpool over the last few seasons, but Chelsea aren't even reaching their goal of the Champions League without it.  They'd need to hit 80 pts to potentially be safe with a deduction of that size and even then that's not a guarantee given 5th placed teams have hit 70 before.  I honestly don't see what their plan is. You can get around things so far, but selling your best academy players and banking on youngsters to come good is so volatile. Nevermind the fact you will eventually end up running out of hotels to sell. You can't sell the stadium to yourself either as I don't think the club actually own it? Isnt Boehly worth billions. I dont think he particularly cares Wtf was the point of saying 14 black defenders? > 14 black defenders  ??? Loaning him won't mean much, he still has around 7 years of contract left... So if he was fit the entire season hed be worth like 240m. What a steal from Chelsea! Ah you never know once a player switches clubs if the injuries will be as prevalent as they were before.   It's not like Chelsea have been cautious with their money either so if it turns out to be a flop then they'll just go again. I fully believe that the prem isn't going to do a thing to them because Chelsea know their limitations and they've not hit it. sorry we don't actually ""scout"" here, we just look at their wikipedia career statistics page and then feel good enough to make conclusions off it Football ability isn't much good on the physio table The best ability is availability Availability>Ability, but Neto is worth it if he‚Äôs playing Wilshere had plenty of ability as well. And he's been retired for years now (he's 32). Injuries add up.... Talent is not worth much if the player can't physically play. Ngl I'm slightly jealous that he's gone to Chelsea cause he is super talented but also not that worried because of his injury record. 1. Scoring 11 goals is part of his ability don‚Äôt think Chelsea are signing him to not score at all   2. He hardly plays Don't listen to that moron. He had 9 assists in 18 starts last season. What ? Arsenal has such a good squad with good system, why would you be jealous of us ? Neto is just one of a million signing from us, you should be worried with the amount of players we have in case some guys flop, the concern is that if someone flops we always have someone else to replace hahahahahah Neto‚Äôs record on the left   44 games 5 goals 6 assists hardly inspired.  He might be his fitness is in question But‚Ä¶it is in question. It‚Äôs not like he had one long injury stint, it‚Äôs been a pattern. Yes, because the premiere league aint full of those players?  We have done it for 15 years, city and all other try to do it now. He'll buy them beer. I have one American backup keeper you can have for the low low price of 40 million quid, barely used Yeah, his injury record is the one (large) red flag. Guess we're confident we can sort it out. As you say, he's undeniably a great player if he can stay fit.   Though 'if he can stay fit' is the caveat to pretty much our entire squad at the minute I agree, but it's an easier sell to Neto if Richarlison would have left.   We're on: Richy, Solanke, Son/Kulu (ST), Kulu, Johnson (RW), Son and Werner (LW).   If I was Neto, I know Kulu is a sicko for running and a fucking brilliant player. I'd rather get paid 50,000 more to sit at Chelsea and compete with Madueke that is streaky asf. If Richy had gone and Ange had given assurances, he would have come, Richy said 'no'.   So we have a guy that's scored 12/60, injured throughout here, struggled with off-the-pitch issues, and hasn't really showed consistent quality in our team. It's all too and well, not turning up for work in the office for a yearl, but then crying 'I'm home'. But no, we need an RW, Kulu and Johnson are in that position, Kulu can't be moved to ST/SS without Richy moving on. We've let this one slip big time. Oh thank god, they really needed more keeper depth. 7 just wasn't enough Are Chelski building like 3 football teams or what.. so many signings.. or do they have so much money that they feel like using it just for the sake of it. No fucking wonder they had to buy a hotel It's like London buses    So they don't have to sign someone tomorrow? There's no wayüò≠ If they don't get any minutes Chelsea is ending up in Haag instead You can only loan out so many over 21s, so not sure what they're gonna do Him and Reece James together on the right flank are a match made in heaven.  They'll be class for the 3 matches a season that they're both fit for. Chelsea see injury records as a challenge. They have different strategy. They'll sign a player who is 34+ & is backup to the backup and then they'll tell him that you'll be starting every single game from now on. That way you‚Äôre guaranteed at least two points every round. Jokes on you it‚Äôs the same people 'I can't believe PSR made us sell Gallagher' it‚Äôs actually crazy how low the expectations for them are. you‚Äôll have chelsea fans defend coming 6th last season when they should be expected to at least challenge for the league. Don't worry about it. I'm sure it makes sense for someone with a big brain, but we common folks who use *common sense* will never understand this. Mudryk and Sterling combined was surely way more than 110m no? Any other club would be slaughtered for this, for Chelsea it's just normal apparently. They should be fighting for the league with how they have spent the last few years. Who‚Äôre also under contract for the next 5 years so who aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Galaxy fucking brain from Chelsea Isn‚Äôt it 140 mil? Saying this like we shouldn't upgrading purely on the fact they cost money.  A player should never get minutes based on value lol Mudryk was such a stupid signing from day one. I can't fathom how anyone was willing to pay more than ¬£30m for him. Who cost 150m? Wait a minute ive seen this one before I'd hope so, but I also assumed Kepa and Lukaku would have been sold by now and here we are with them still on the books.  We're signing new players, but *really* need to sell some of the ones we don't  want. Who will buy him. Same problem with all the UTD cast offs? So they added another player with an history of injuries to a squad that already has that problem? Yeah those are the players that fill out the rest of squad spots that I said that were relatively cheap and some are not part of their plans and will be sold or loaned by the end of the market. Yes this is exactly how it works lmao, I notice how Brighton is clear declining after we bought Caicedo. However, even though this is beneficial to Chelsea, I find it unfair for other clubs. Of course as a Chelsea fan, I would want Pedro Neto to be here but I feel it is so unfair for other clubs Thanks mate, you've just jinxed it Charity FC Baby üí™  We either dominate but don't capitalise, so don't win, or we play like shit. There is no alternative I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll be a problem Our net spend this window before buying Neto was -¬£2m. And we still intend to sell Lukaku, Chalobah, Broja, Datro Fofana, Kepa, etc. https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Faoouay8z6hhd1.jpeg&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=Gunners&utm_content=t1_lhby1p6 Because clubs keep bailing them out like United with Mount and now Villa, Ipswich and Newcastle You're right, might as well buy another winger just in case Don't worry I'm sure their injuries will line up perfectly It's the Russian way of solving problems - throw bodies at the problem. Instead of having two available guys, have four injury prone dudes.  Abramovic would be proud. Wise move. Managers don't have to worry about player rotation. Collect injury prone players.  And play them alternate so they dont get injured.   Or well, all of them gets injured at the same time, and Chelsea sign another 5 backup in the January window. Good thing they have depth to cover for them It‚Äôs like The Simpsons cursed frogurt meme Are they really? What's Thiago at these days? so then Nkunku? just benched? Weird? This is how transfers should be done. yeah it was like that when liverpool signed jota from wolves, there was nothing and then boom ornstein and joyce tweet and he‚Äôs holding up the shirt a few minutes later We get a lot of fake rumors. The real ones happen very quickly and people like Fabrizio ramano are not the first to post about it Oh Lord. I love the banter. This was good. Buy a bigger plane. Or throw some of your other passengers off the plane... *cough* **Conor** *cough* Those don‚Äôt count for this transfer window.  I believe they‚Äôre counted in next summers transfer window 17m pounds for Paez. Estevao is the expensive one at ~30m Nah, it's pretty low. They have a shit ton of players on some minimum wage 8 year bs deal looks like. I can only see 2 or 3 in that whole squad being worthy of a first team salary. Neto, Sterling and maybe.. well I can't think of anyone else worth big money.¬† They sold hotels, parking lots and the Chelsea W teams to their parent company I guess. Revenue¬† It doesn't matter as long as you are selling players every window, especially home grown players who entire sale hits the book immediately. Our amortisation cost (or yearly hit as you‚Äôve described it) for was ¬£205m as per the latest accounts.   It‚Äôs only going to have gone up from there.   Which means we have a yearly expenditure of 200m amortisation + 200-300m in wages + any other costs (we spent 75m on agent fees last accounts)   ¬£500m+ of yearly costs against a revenue of ¬£500m (which has been boosted by player sales and infrastructure ‚Äòsales‚Äô) doesn‚Äôt seem like a healthy situation for a club to be in They're still on a pretty big deficit and if you sum up the last two transfer windows they must be getting dangerously close to -800 or 900M.   It's madness, I don't know how this is allowed. For now, yes, but not next year or the one after ... etc ... for 5 years+ They don't need to break even.   The owners are pouring money into the club. The sales give them enough to keep in line with FFP.   If you look at the % of spending to sales clubs like arsenal and United are just as bad. Chelsea are just doing more of it so the total numbers look much worse.  Having 400m in sales and spending 1B puts you at 600m in the red.  That's no different than 40m in sales and spending 100m, that puts you at 60m in the red but the %s are the same for FFP.  (Obviously these are generalizations)  The big negative totals aren't what matters. If there's anything we've learned from Boehly and co that they're good at, it's finding loopholes that can be exploited. No matter how risky it actually is, if they see something that is in any way loosely covered or doesn't cover a specific use case, they will exploit it The rules don't matter. They've sold the women's team, Cobham and the hotels to themselves. There's another trick somewhere.   Maybe part of the stadium, maybe they'll sell some kind of sponsorship infrastructure to themselves. Maybe they'll just take a point deduction. Obviously they're not concerned with it, so there's clearly a trick. You think this is insane? Wait until we buy another 150m of kids in January ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù by selling 1 Tyrique George for 20m lmaooo we are absolutely scamming the system somehow, not even the finest Reddit accountants could possibly explain this level of spending This window we've spent ~¬£110mil and garnered about that in player sales..  And because of the way Amortisation works, this year we've effectively spent ¬£22mil on players and will spend ¬£22mil over the next five years. Plus *far* lower wages than we had (another ¬£50mil a year saved from two years ago).  It's kicking the can down the road a bit, but *surely* they'll stop this mad hoarding of players at some point  and then the idea is they'll have a load of players to sell and have so many that they won't need to rebuild the entire squad for a while either, just a player or two when needed.  It's a long-term strategy that they're speedrunning the start of (in the same way they replaced all but Chilwell and James from their squad in two years and shouldn't need many major signings again) but we'll see how effective it is. To yourselves.  Infinite loop glitch. With all due respect to Reece James, because he is so talented, but who would want to spend an absurd amount for him?  He‚Äôs already a Chelsea player, too. Seems that narrows his market. Couldn't the Premier League do away with this ""pure profit"" nonsense or is that just more of a worldwide accounting thing? Getting sick of hearing about it. Yeah, this is not how lol  They sold carparks, hotels and the women‚Äôs team to themselves. >should¬†  Ive been hearing this about kepa for the last 5 years. It's an equity contribution by the owner which by the current rules is limited at ¬£90m over three years in PSR. You can make pizza, bread, pasta, naan. Anything with that much dough. Manu doesn‚Äôt fuck up good players tho, they just buy bad players I mean both clubs have new ownership, and the worst indictment you can give is that the new Chelsea seem like the old United.  Great signing, if I trusted Chelsea to develop and use their players properly. I didn't say we don't do that üò≠ I assume you didn't read my other reply then? In fairness, his attitude's been poor. Someone like Falcao or Van De Beek would be better examples I'd argue that they've spent ¬£1.2bn and arguably have a worse squad than they did before. Well its been a massive failure so far. Its not like other clubs want to copy chelseas ridiculous mismanagment since the takeover so i think the talk of them ruining football is a bit overblown. That said i think if this strategy somehow ends up being successfull that would be a disaster for football  Other teams are laughing to the bank selling randim teenagers to chelsea while they reinvest into their own clubs Chelsea is basically a fully stocked Subway at this point where you can build your own team based on your preferences. The players bought should still fit in the managers style tho. The only reason that wouldn't be the case was if you were sacking the manager Idk maybe on the bench I think he may play as a 9 and Jackson as LW but honestly fuck knows. Just trying to make this make sense  Or Neto plays on the left while we figure out what to do with mudryk he actually shows up in training. Is there any truth to the Osimhen, Lukaku swap? Heard Conte is very keen on Lukaku. Mind you these are all rumours and quite frankly, the Oshimen demands have priced him out of the market for sure. Its not bad, but for 60 mil?   Roma bought Dovbyk and Soule who had 24/8 g/a and 11/3 g/a at Girona and Frosinone for around 60/65mil in total [deleted] I wouldnt buy Maddison for 60 million either.  Im not shitting on him, just saying for this money its hardly good business. > Except Chelsea have completely overhauled the wage structure under Roman.   These younger 'potential' players are probably going from 10k a week to 40-50-60k a week. Not huge wages but when there's 25 of them it all adds up. Neto was only on 50k a week at Wolves, tripling it wouldn‚Äôt have even come close to any of the aboves demands I'd be totally stunned if they stopped spending lol. They've changed plan about 5 times already since getting in > You can‚Äôt sell Hotels, Women‚Äôs teams, and training grounds every year though  Not with that attitude Just buy a new hotel and sell it to themselves for double the price. Problem solved, money for their 9th GK secured. Just buy hotels like players and sell later duh. Infinite money glitch. I assume Eggball's strategy would be to start selling off some of these young assets he's acquiring in order to buy more young assets. In theory you don't need a massive injection of cash  besides at the start as you have assets (players) on the book you can fleece in the future and tick over from there. I read that they‚Äôve basically sold them to themselves and given themselves a management contract so they don‚Äôt miss out on the income, so shady that it‚Äôs genius. Dont worry, the people who own you will be there to grossly overspend on ageing Chelsea players However, he can and also plays down the left. Overall agree with you. Awful fitness record, high signing fee, already bloated squad, and already 2 existing players in each position he might play. Selling real estate to an entity also owned by you definitely feels  like a loophole. Champions League or bust, essentially. That income is basically the minimum they'll need to comply. [deleted] [deleted] You think even the richest person in the world wont care about their multi billion dollar asset? Lmao Because there are like 14 black defenders, that's just facts. Can't name half of them, constantly injured or loaned out. But at least there‚Äôs a chance for him to play consistently and maybe even develop  He could have been a good player imo, but chose the wrong club I am saying to loan him to build up his value a bit Agree, I‚Äôm happy we didn‚Äôt pull the trigger because, while we‚Äôre not short of cash, we don‚Äôt take the same gambles Chelsea does. Just playing the odds, I‚Äôm glad we steered clear of his injury history. I think Neto is a solid player and worth the price if he wasn't injured constantly Kante barely played major football for two years then casually walsed into the Euros and saved your boy from a Gerrard 2014 moment.  Ability > anything else. He'll rotate at Chelsea, I wouldn't be surprised if his injury record improves  O'Neil admitted to starting Neto despite knowing he wasn't 100% when he did his hamstring, that won't happen at Chelsea (I hope) He has 19 assists in total in the prem last season was a fluke I'm not saying im jealous of you as a team or a club or squad haha. Just of signing Neto. If he stays injury free, ofc a big if, that is a phenomenal talent right there. A GK getting put up for sale is like putting out the bat signal for Paul Winstanley and Behdad Egbhali Is Madueke out going? Because he's surely not starting over Neto. It's all part of the Grand Plan to field 11 GK's at the same time.  Just need 3 more You're gonna look really silly if 6 of their keepers get injured now Is that where Ten Hag is from? Good thing they're all 19 then lmao the rest either get domestic loans or are sold 6 per team I believe. 90 games a season. just need 30 players on every position and you good They should be looking to spend 20 mil on a top class physio instead of the goalkeer hoarding. Records are made to be broken! We‚Äôre suffering out here‚Ä¶let us have our small ‚Äúvictories‚Äù such as the finished 6th last season trophy That's because there's a big difference between delusionally expecting something and actually looking at the reality and setting normal expectations. Sure with the money spent Chelsea should be challenging but the reality is that the majority of the money has been wasted on youth players or inexperienced players that don't actually improve the team.   The owners/sporting directors deserve to be criticized as much as possible for what they've done, but ultimately the fans can only base their expectations on the quality of the players. I don't think anyone, not even just Chelsea fans are going to look at the best 11 and expect them to be better than Man City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man Utd, etc. Not a single real person expects chelsea would challenge for the league No one expected Chelsea to challenge for the league year one. City is just too well oiled.  But yea you'd think there would be more progress given the money they have spent. If you strip away the money the spend and look at their squad, I‚Äôd say 5th-7th is right where they should be. Which is worse. We should, but anyone with any semblance of ball knowledge knows we sure as hell won't be. Money doesn't buy quality, proper scouting does. The players they're signing are good but I don't think anyone of them is world class or close to it, their strategy is flabbergasting. I mean looking at the squad that actually played most games it could've been a lot worse than 6th. Despite all that spending they played basically a mid table squad. They wouldn't have been challenging for the league even if fully healthy. Yeah man no one‚Äôs said a word about Chelsea‚Äôs spending ay fucking lol Not including the add-ons for Mudryk, yeah ¬£110m is fairly accurate. No chance he‚Äôs activated any of the ¬£30m bonuses yet. But yeah ridiculous spending anyway Was about ¬£110m. Rest of mudryk fee was add-ons for PL and CL wins. Mudryk I believe was also 60 million pounds (with a bunch of ad ons he won't reach at this point) and Sterling can't have been 50 million right?.....right? I don't think you visit this sub often because yes, Chelsea get slaughtered a fair bit. Really. They spent horribly. Maybe this will be a good signing Chelsea are slaughtering themselves with this  This kind of shopping spree worked well when Roman took over, now we get the chance to see what happens if it doesn‚Äôt they said ""spending 150m on 2 players"". Not on 150m on players twice.  And theres about 35 combinations of chelsea players whose price adds up to 150+m Mudryk + Sterling I think we will get bailed out by SA again. Sounds like a solid strategy if they all get injured at different times Mate that's just under 400 million Euro's worth of player right there that you've left off. I agree. I would hate it if you bought Aaron Ramsdale from us for 40m, please don't do that... so unfair That's true if we only look at it from this window. But over the past 3 seasons, chelsea spent north of a billion Could they not try playing one of their goalkeepers on the wing? If it fails, they can just try another one. Boehly just found another ¬£100 million in his couch cushions Enzo has come out and said that Nkunku can play as an 8, 9, 10 and even on the wings. We havent seen both Palmer and Nkunku playing yet in this system, but im assuming Palmer will most likely be the 10, which ideally would make Nkunku the 9. If any of Jackson/Guiu/Omorodion play then Nkunku can play as the 8 that drifts up or as a winger.   Personally I think Nkunku 9 and Palmer 10 will be how they begin the season considering Jackson is injured. Neto, Samu, and that other keeper you're about to sign will bring it over ‚Ç¨250m spent, which is mad considering Neto is probably the only player from that who most people have even heard of. So i expect you'll spend less next summer? Or in the next summer you'll kick the can down the road once again and just spread the cost once again   Creative accounting is a stain on society, spending money that doesn't exist I'd imagine Enzo, caicedo, Chilwell and James on big salaries too, before we even touch on Lukaku and Kepa etc Palmer tbf, probably Nkunku if he returns to german form. What are they going to do? Transfer ban us? Good. Actually, I'm hoping they do :| Surely you can't just expect to sell talents from the academy for that much money every year for the next seven years. This just seems like a recipe for disaster with just one window without outgoings could totally cripple you. And if some of the incommings don't work out it will be hard to replace them It's not allowed though.  Unfortunately there's nothing in football to stop dumb people doing dumb things until they've done them. Not how it works. Gotta amortize those transfer fees my friend. This is the thing that most people miss. It's not necessarily this year that is the problem. It is when they are carrying 350 million in amortisation every year and all the academy sales fall out of the 3 year window. They have to keep selling massively every year at a book profit to cover the amortised purchases. If they aren't able to flip a large amount of their purchases for big profits they could be in a lot of trouble unless the academy pumps obscene levels of players. Right now they have gone through about 6 years worth of academy graduates in 2 years. > The sales give them enough to keep in line with FFP  ‚Ä¶. Except they haven‚Äôt?   Last accounting period we were around 70m over the allowable loss limit. The period before that we were about 40m over it.   This was after huge sales of players.   The only reason we didn‚Äôt fail PSR in those periods was because we sold hotels and then the women‚Äôs team/our training ground.   Even with our amazing sales we haven‚Äôt been able to comply without needing to sell infrastructure. We‚Äôre very quickly going to run out of infrastructure to bail us out and due to our mediocre onfield performances the moment of players we can sell for book profit is dwindling more and more. Being 600m in debt is much worse than 60m though as they don't generate much more income elsewhere than the other big clubs Your example in the second to last paragraph feels suspect. Because using a % like that for FFP makes so little sense, if net loss is completely ignored. Sell ¬£4m spend ¬£10m is really the same as those? Haven‚Äôt actually read the FFP rules though so what do I know Precisely. It‚Äôs clear that the owners are trying to invest as heavily as possible but are held back by PSR. As long as they‚Äôre compliant, it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre not bothered about being in the red in the short to medium term. I just don‚Äôt see it how they will be able to develop all those young signingns.. i guess that‚Äôs where the multi-club model comes in handy Can he use a loophole to make his team finish higher than 6th? What i dont understand is that looking at the 2021 CL winning team its literally better than this one.  yes theyre bench is better and they have some good young players but theyve literally spent a billion to get worse. I dont understand it No offense you've sold your best players to buy average ones I wouldn't brag Yeah I understand the theory behind all of this, but it‚Äôs kicking *several* cans down the road. What happens in two years when they desperately need to buy two or three players to stay competitive just to still be Klarna-ing 300m? It‚Äôs madness The 65 players in the squad gotta live somewhere! Oh god....that's Barcelona music after seeing Trent join Madrid and they feel like they need to do a similar move I used to think he‚Äôd end up eventually at Real  But his form has dipped since then If he has one healthy season ( which is a long shot tbh) he will have a market, granted cut price for player of his ability. Everything is pure profit if you never paid anything for it in the first place. It all goes hand in hand no ?   Pure profit sales allows them to sign more players ‚Ä¶ üòÇüòÇ Old United spent big on big name players not random South American talents and 18 year old goal keepers.¬† > new Chelsea seem like the old United.  Old United bought big-name players (often on the older side) for big money and stuck them on massive wages.  Chelsea are buying a *lot* of 18-year-olds on minimum wages with the idea of selling them in a few years. for profit.  How are they the same? United were buying washed expensive players for ridiculous wages, not potential wonder kids lol Completely different. I beg you to go look at that squad we had summer of 22 after Marina let Rudiger and Christensen leave on frees. There's no way you can tell me with a straight face you think that squad with Mount, Werner, Havertz, and Ziyech is better than Palmer, Jackson, Nkunku, and Neto. Yeah I guess we'll all just have to figure out how a touchline winger like Neto will fit with a manager who has explicitly said he uses touchline wingers. Pep was the first to do the opposite. The club decides the way they want to play. All teams play that style from the 1st team to the youth. The manager is there to implement that style. They have no say in transfers.  That's what Chelsea is doing. Nkunku is not a striker. Mucy better to just stick with jackson. Basically zero chance, the only reason he was even linked to us last week was because no one else would take him and Conte wanted Lakaka. Our main journos were briefed that we ended our interest in Osimhen all the way back in June. Not bad? Not many players are assisting every other game Impressive for neto in a worse and much less attacking team You tried to shit on him for his stats which wasn't well thought out Not in their transfer strategy. They have a long outlook of getting young players and having them grow together and sell the ones who don‚Äôt make first team. Their signings seem to correlate with that. Will it work? Unlikely. But as a fan, I‚Äôm here for it and hope it ends up silencing the haters. Otherwise I‚Äôll be just drinking a couple more beers per game to get through the banter. That may give them profits on the books due to amortization, but I seriously doubt they'll make any money. We‚Äôve had 6 windows to do that‚Ä¶. Wouldn‚Äôt you expect that to have happened by now?  the only Chelsea player we bought was a 19 year old left back with parents from the Northeast Yeah, he's good at LW too. An improvement over Sterling and Mudryk, but I feel they have higher priorities, like striker. Maybe they'll get a good striker too as they seem to have unlimited funds and PSR room Agreed but was responding specifically to the suggestion that   > Clearlake are selling academy players for 100% profit. They know what they‚Äôre doing, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be sanctioned but I think the PL will rewrite the laws on this sort of spending loophole  Which I don't think is a loophole, just very short-sighted hence the actual loopholes they're exploiting like selling things to themselves. Another season at 10th will probably bankrupt Todd in near future yeah > You‚Äôre making a massive assumption that the amortized fees break any rules.  I absolutely am not. Frankly it's a nonsensical statement, the amortised fees cannot by themselves break any rule - only Chelsea's ability to sustain them, while functioning as a football club, and staying above PSR rules can break any rules.  So let's consider if there's any evidence of Chelsea being unable to keep this up.... well as I stated in my comment [they've had to sell hotels to themselves](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/apr/19/chelseas-765m-hotel-deals-raise-questions-over-psr-compliance) without which they would have made losses that did breach the rules - as I said ""dodgy territory"". ~~I believe they need to be under 21 and club trained (meaning 3 years at the club between 15 and 21) to be exempt from counting towards the limit.~~(this was incorrect) But even assuming they make it for now it's surely going to get worse over the next 2-3 years unless they're able to sell 5+ 'first team' players and to do this in a financially viable way.  Will be interesting to see, they have always been able to sell well so might be able to keep themselves ahead of the limit/banish from the first team squads if necessary. to what end? Nobody is going to sign a player who has 6 or 7 years of contract left and is on PL wages, and that's assuming that he actually plays good enough to raise his value. His value is basically 0 If he wasn't injured constantly he could play for any team on earth. In the euros which is a tournament of what 8 games? this is not a slight with neto btw, why are you pressed? LMAOO chelski fans down bad I don‚Äôt think they paid 63 million with the intention of being a rotation player, every player plays when they‚Äôre not 100% you hear it from every former player, players are rarely ever 100%.   Chelsea also have a horrendous injury history record with their players right now > that won't happen at Chelsea (I hope)  If he's good it will, because it's what happens at top level football (sport). He's been steadily improving every season, it's obvious for those who actually watch him play. It's just his constant injuries been hampering him. Ask any wolves fan, they'll all say this guy is a baller. He's actually had a pretty decent pre season, and is well liked in the squad. I don't know if he realistically has a long term future here or not. But I doubt we'd see him move this window.   I'd assume we'll aim to play Neto on the left side, competing with Sterling and Mudryk. And Madueke will remain an option on the right. Either that, or Palmer will be deployed centrally and Neto/Madueke fight for the right hand side. I thought the grand plan was to eventually sign every single professional football player, thereby becoming the best team by default Sanchez  Bettineli  Bleach  Petrovic  Jorgensen  Penders  Slonina  Kepa  I think i m missing someone How would you score past 11 gk's!? Genius by Boehly! 11-0-0, they won't let in any goal if they have 11 in the goal post. Plus imagine all the field goal they're going to take, 3 pts each, all the gk must make a great kick team! Boehly masterclass all the way! I believe our owners think this is 7 days to die and need 11 GK to craft a premier league level keeper But a maximum of 3 from the same club. Chelsea are WAY ahead of you lol. Yeah man it's been three whole years since you won a Champions League, no-one deserves such pain Nobody expected Chelsea to challenge because they‚Äôve been actively using transfer windows to make their squad worse. I don‚Äôt think anyone in their right mind since Boehly took over has thought ‚Äúthese guys are moving in the right direction.‚Äù >No one expected Chelsea to challenge for the league year one. City is just too well oiled.  This proves his point completely. Chelsea were nowhere near even the top 4 all season despite what they've spent and not much has been said. Or it doesn't seem like it >No one expected Chelsea to challenge for the league year one. City is just too well oiled.  ""Year one"" is a very weird way to describe a club that consistently maintained a very high valuation on players even amidst a single bad season with a similar core of players that had also recently won the CL. Dumb take I'd expect crystal palace to challenge for the league if they spent a billion over three transfer windows. Depends on what they were. Some are really simple, appearance based. But yeah, there's a good amount still left on the table in bonuses. [Sorry to say](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/12647321/raheem-sterling-chelsea-sign-forward-from-man-city-for-gbp47-5m) Ok name any of them? That‚Äôs 110 (60+50) so where‚Äôs the rest? I specifically said this window. Also, yes, spend was over a billion but net spend wasn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve also sold a lot of players in 5 windows the the new ownership have had so far. Net spend is 650 million. Not that I‚Äôm justifying their policy, I‚Äôm tired of all the unproven young talent they keep buying and stockpiling. Just saying everyone keeps throwing out that ‚Äúbillion‚Äù number but no one seems to ever take into account how much they have also sold. At this rate I thought the idea was actually to field a starting XI with just goalkeepers, but I can see that happening if the need arises But you guys just brought in more 10s and two number 9s  the whole thing is a mess  next year you get another winger and 10 in who need to play We already have Enzo, KDH, Lavia and Caceido in midfield (6s and 8s). Not sure how there's space for Nkunku anywhere deeper than upfront. It‚Äôll take years before we know if this model is successful of buying young players relatively cheap and then flipping them.  I‚Äôm very curious how it‚Äôll work out.  But we also still have plenty of players to sell (Kepa, Broja, Chalobah, Petro) this window. It‚Äôs not creative accounting it‚Äôs just the FFP rules.  Estavao and Kendry were bought from their clubs this year.  But since they‚Äôre under 18 they can‚Äôt join Chelsea yet, so their fees are counted under FFP when they are actually able to join the club. Ever since our sporting directors came in that 1st January window under Boehly our wage structure has been very strict and I believe only 2 players were given over $100k/week. It also helps that as we‚Äôre these high potential kids to lower deals were offloading overpaid Abramovich era players; Lavia, Palmer, Gusto, Disasi, Nico Jackson, and Madueke combined make as much as Lukaku. Their manager made some comments about chillwell may not fit into his squad so gone status is he. If someone is dumb enough to pay 60m for Neto someone will be dumb enough to take chillwell and his big salary for 2 games a season. The others yeah you may be right.¬† Forgot about cold Hate when people shit on their own club for fake internet points. We got ¬£20m ish for Hutchinson, who want even our academy player and barely saw the pitch for us. That's what's going to happen with most of the young players we're buying. Datro, casadei, etc etc. if we can make ¬£10m-20m profit on each of them, that's pretty successful. Yeah I'm sure nobody has thought of it, you right. What we're doing is absolutely, 100% allowed. On the other hand they‚Äôre signing a load of players for their academy. Maybe rules allow those players to be sold for 100% profit once they‚Äôve been at the academy long enough to be ‚Äúhome grown‚Äù? 600m is not worse when you have 10 times as many assets. No, but he can use a loophole to keep Spurs from a trophy. To a degree you‚Äôre right. That cl win was heralded as incredible because that squad did have younger players. However that kinda ignores things. Thiago silva, kante very much at the end of their careers, rudiger and Christensen leaving on frees to big Spanish teams, Werner while a bit of a cult hero really wasn‚Äôt worth keeping around, havertz not finding his feet really, both wing backs being very fragile etc. Jorginho has done well for arsenal but he‚Äôs not the linchpin he once was, mount situation was an entire mess.   While yes it was a good squad, it wasn‚Äôt one they were ever going to be able to keep together. Some of it was forced upon them, some of it bad luck, some questionable decisions around the time of the sanctions etc. They sell 6 of their 8 goalkeepers for an average of ¬£20mil each to cover it.  Why do you think they're buying so many young players early? It's for precisely that reason - so they have a load of assets to sell when needed to cover in a specific year.  How effective it'll be is something we don't know yet (by definition it's a long-term plan and it's still early days) and ethically and as a fan it pisses of me off to no end, but if you look at it purely from an accountancy standpoint what they're doing can be argued to make sense - invest a lot up front so you don't have to invest anywhere near as much in future and have disposable assets to cover any year-on-year shortfalls. Yes, your description of the two words ""pure"" and ""profit"" put together is accurate, well done. I'm clearly not arguing the definition or semantics of it though, am I? The part that you're forgetting is the cash flow/ cash-on-hand portion. While the owners have an insane amount of wealth and can more than likely keep pumping money in, there is an upper limit to the cash-flow they have, which can cause bankruptcy. I doubt it can ever get to that point. These people aren‚Äôt interested in the actual answer they just want to cry because their clubs don‚Äôt spend as much as we do or sell as well as we do and refuse to believe that the new owners are getting away with bankrolling football. Old United let idiots who know nothing about building an elite environment run a club based on their preconceptions and arrogance.  Chelsea are doing the same. Only spending more money and fucking themselves over even harder. United at the least always had seniors in the dressing room capable of influencing fellow players, and had developed pros who were high quality. There was always a Matic, an Ibra, a Bruno etc... after SAFs players had phased out.  But that's tangential. The point is that Chelsea has people who think they know how to run a club, and they don't. And it's fucking them over. >How are they the same?  By ignoring the idea of squad composition to execute a strategy decided by people ignorant to how an elite environment operates. Particularly given the influence of the ownership.  It's not about the specific strategy, it's about the arrogance of outsiders thinking they have the knowledge to run a football club themselves.  And tbh they'd be better going with United's old strategy anyways at the level of spend they've had. But that's not really the point. The point is that the people making the decisions have the arrogance and stupidity combination required to mire a club in mediocrity, at the least. Mount was your two time player of the season. Werner is no worse than Jackson. Havertz is better than Nkunku. Neto hasn't even signed for you yet and is injury prone.  Besides, I'm not saying that you haven't improved in any positions. Palmer is obviously an example of that. I'm saying the squad itself looks worse. Maybe the players develop and achieve their potential and things change, but right now it looks worse or at best there has been no improvement. im not saying it about this transfer. But acting like Managers have 0 correllation to the players brought in is dumb as fuck JFC, of course managers don't sign players.   But if a manager plays without an attacking midfielder then wtf is a sporting director doing signing one. They may or may not get asked, ""Would you like us to sign this player"", but there will 100% be a link between the manager you have and the players you sign. Ahh right. Fair enough. I assume Lukaku will definitely be shifted by the end of the window no matter what. Not many players missing 100 games in 4 seasons. Especially when their club tends to play under 45 games a season [deleted] I tried to say his stats arent worth paying 60 million for him. I wouldnt say any player who isnt worth 60mil is bad or anything. They went for experience at first and signed Sterling, Koulibaly, Cucurella and Aubameyang in the first window then completely flipped that, sacked the manager and signed Mudryk and Enzo for 200m in January. They then tried to shift all their experienced players for a team of children. Since then they've moved towards the football manager strategy of hoarding wonderkids.   They also sacked their manager again, went for an experienced hire now he's gone and it's a prospect again.   They've also changed backroom staff personnel, structure, and responsibilities multiple times.  I don't believe you can argue there's been a coherent transfer strategy since they came in. At first they went experienced player route, then expensive young players ready for the first team, then wonderkids and loan farm. They had no idea what they were doing when they came in, this isn't some 4 year plan. They do seem to have settled on something at least, even if it is stupid They're not in this for money Clearlake owns like 50+ billion in properties. This is all about a couple billionaire's ego and they're funded by a parent company that wants to own a famous football club because of the future growth potential of the PL. I've never been worried about the funding coming into the club at any point in this whole clusterfuck, the problem arises if Clearlake run us into a financial corner where we can't spend due to PSR even if the owners have the money I was referring to the other Saudi vanity project, the Saudi Pro League We have Jackson, and are currently signing Samu. Currently have Lukaku, Broja, Datro Fofana, Marc Guiu and Deivid Washington. Nkunku can play up top in a pinch.   Not amazing quality but they are all here and need to clear house on a ton of those or at least loan them out. Fair point, I agree with you that selling the academy players isn't a loophole, just a bigger benefit on the FFP balance sheets since its 100% profit.  I couldn't help but point out that while Chelsea do well with selling players unwanted players as well as profiting from their academy, they also dabble in the dark arts of the football accounting world. You have any idea how much money clearlake has? [deleted] Yea we don't need to loan him so we can get a better selling price. We need to loan him so he can become a better player for us The season before last he got 0 goals and 0 assists Thanks for the insight! Maybe they trying some weird FM strat.   We pay you 99% less salary if you play 5 games or less.   Easy money the player thinks.   First training day arrives: ""Your kit is in changing room 56, training starts today at 9 on Training field 84."" Has it really only been 3 years? Man, it feels like 10.... And that's probably why Chelsea fans don't have high expectations, I wouldn't if I was them. Anyone with half a brain cell knows their new owners are clueless and everything they've done has been total nonsense. I‚Äôm very proud to hold one of the least popular opinions in football. >and not much has been said  What rock have you been under (and is there space for one more) How many of the players playing many games last year won CL? > Some are really simple, appearance based.  200 IQ move by Boehly, buying in Neto so they can save money by not playing Mudryk I think they have all been reported (by Shaktar president too) to be related to winning league titles and CLs 47million is cheap for such a big bunda idk why youre trying to be so combative about this when a full list is right here and takes less than 20 seconds to find  https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/fc-chelsea/alletransfers/verein/631  have fun mate I'll do better, I'll name 5 different combos   Lukaku and nkunku  Mudryk and fofana  Caicedo and lavia  Kepa and Cucurella  Enzo and Palmer. [here's a good set of combos to equal 150m](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/l2anwfsCbB) Mudryk was 90m Iirc ffp is over a 3? year span. So just looking at it from this summer alone isn't enough. I'm also a Chelsea fan, so I'm aware of how much money we've generated from selling players. But there's no way around it. Despite selling so many, it's still pale in comparison to the billion we've spent. Like you said 650 million in the red, how are we complying with ffp? And how are we even planning to recoup the money we spent? ~20 million for multiple gk each is a steep price if we're banking on turning a profit in a few years. It just doesn't make sense to me 38 GWs, 38 different wingers! Lukaku ""relatively cheap""??? What was the record transfer fee for goalkeepers with TWO professional matches played before we dropped 20m on Penders?? Those four combined are worth what? 40-45m? Gotcha, so Enzo and Caicedo probs the 2 (unless Mudryk got some huge undeserved bag), and then James and Chilwell being from before may still be high?   Don't know how Kepa and Lukaku's loans worked before in terms of wages but they'll need to offload them both asap Haha, true. Decent player on his day though Definitely not shitting on Chelsea. We have more than enough players, and a ban would mean we can't buy any more. I'm wondering if it wont be harder and harder to sell since the buyers know you have to sell ? Anyway to me it still seems like an extremely risky strategy where the risk is much greater than the reward Well the transfer strategy will certainly matter at some point, so you can't really say it won't matter who they buy Taking huge losses every year is not allowed under FFP. Academy players are 100% profit because there was zero cost to acquire them. Has nothing to do whether they are homegrown or not. So all these academy players they are buying for 15-25 million have to be amortised and carry a book value that needs to exceeded to record a profit. Well they don't have 250 players yet Ok It's funny that you think people are jealous of the way that Chelsea are run. Fair enough lol , I‚Äôm all for clowning Chelsea but this is a great move for you guys , Neto is a great talent No, this is literally how you didn‚Äôt end up in trouble, if it was for player sales only Chelsea would be in deep shit. I‚Äôm not refusing to believe anything, that‚Äôs just how it is. And you know better than professional sporting directors/ sports analysts/ scouting networks, how? [deleted] > By ignoring the idea of squad composition to execute a strategy decided by people ignorant to how an elite environment operates.  I'm not sure I agree with you there, their squad composition is pretty clear and are even selling/buying players specifically to suit their composition (Gallagher out, Omorodin in for example).  What you're saying is true **if and only if** you assume that every youngster brought in was bought to play for the first team, and that's not true - the vast majority of transfers are probably going have a David Fofana trajectory where they're sold with minimal minutes for Chelsea in order to fund other players.  Chelsea's strategy is ""buy a new first team squad that's young and locked in on long contracts, and then buy a load of youths that they sell for profit later on"". Which is also a long-term plan given the age of who they've bought, so if you're looking specifically at the first season post-takeover then it went badly, but even last year they finished above Manchester United with the joint-youngest squad in Premier League history.  I think you're being far too critical and harsh of what's a long-term strategy - and one that's already starting to take shape. They're not buying eight goalkeepers *to fight for the number one spot*, they're buying 2-3 goalkeepers for that and the rest are there to develop and if successful join the squad and if not be sold for hopefully more than we paid for them. If you didn't believe you were so arrogantly correct. You would know that those owners also own a baseball team, which also operates in an elite environment.  Also, the owners have taken a step back and allowed people who have expertise in professional football related activities to run the operations of the club.  So, YES, it does kill me when uninformed people arrogantly think they know best, but instead, it just makes them look stupid and ignorant >Mount was your two time player of the season.  Okay, that doesn't mean he's any good. Did you watch him the year before he went to United or at United? He was awful.  >Werner is no worse than Jackson  Oh lord...  >Havertz is better than Nkunku.  Lol not even sure Arsenal fans would agree with that.   >Neto hasn't even signed for you yet and is injury prone.  Still better than Ziyech.  >Besides, I'm not saying that you haven't improved in any positions. Palmer is obviously an example of that. I'm saying the squad itself looks worse. Maybe the players develop and achieve their potential and things change, but right now it looks worse or at best there has been no improvement.  Please, actually look at the squad and not just say this. No one who actually looked at both squads believes this. The only position we've actually downgraded at is centerback and only because Thiago Silva can't be replaced. Did you mean to reply to someone else? Yes very impressive. So the only older players the bought were in the first two months of ownership. I‚Äôm not sure there was a coherent plan then, but that is very much a transition time. However, since then they have stated their goals and started to align their transfers accordingly. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they discovered just how risky(and expensive!!!) the Enzo/Mudryk window was and decided to focus on more quantity with younger players. I hope they continue to grab some more veteran players, but a vast majority of their signings are super duper young. So if we are using outliers to diminish their plan, I guess nobody has a transfer plan. None of those are good strikers. You also have too many wingers and gks, it didn't stop you from buying more. So I don't see why what you said would stop you from getting another stiker.  If you sell Lukaku and buy Oshimen, that's good, but if you buy another Jackson or Samu, well then you haven't improved your starting 11 at all.  At least Neto improves your left wing a little, even if it isn't his main position You are correct, checked direct with FIFA as others are reporting it it as explicitly requiring both. That gives a lot more flexibility, particularly if they sign people at 18 or younger making them ""homegrown"" by the time they're over 21. Lol keep reaching, man. Why go two seasons before? Why not go even further back? Time goes slowly when you‚Äôre in the football trenches. 10 managers maybe. What‚Äôs interesting is that I felt like as the season ended, Chelsea seemed like a good shout for a top 4 next season. But with the manager appointment, signings and preseason results, now it‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ 7th seems about right? ü§î Haha! It's mainly just fans though isn't it. Or pundits wondering aloud what they're doing.   No one's really taking them seriously whereas I think if it was another big 6 club they'd be slaughtered more for their league positions/performances after spending so much. The fact that they *chose* to replace the entire squad with unproven, impossibly expensive youth players does not mean we all should magically grade them on a curve. It's easy to ruin a successful club, no other major clubs consciously choose to suck for multiple seasons which is what you seem to be arguing we should have known Chelsea were willing to do. You don‚Äôt get to Boehly‚Äôs position in life by being an idiot‚Ä¶wait a second.. Nope The high value signings that add up to 150m are all players Chelsea would be happy to play >Lukaku and nkunku  Nkunku would be top of the teamsheet if he was available last year, we were absolutely crying out for him - it was only due to a massive injury we couldn't.  >Mudryk and fofana  Less than ¬£150mil, and again - Fofana was injured for last season. Not starting because he wasn't available.  >Caicedo and lavia  Caceido always plays when he can, and Lavia would be pretty close to starting - but again had massive injuries and was out for the season.  >Kepa and Cucurella  Cucu started a *lot* last season, and bringing up Kepa as an example of ""Boehlynomics"" is ridiculous given the number of things that contributed to his wages.  >Enzo and Palmer  Always start if available.  Besides, Mudryk + Fofana wasn't ¬£150mil, nor were Kepa and Cucurella. The original comment said two players worth 150m that they can‚Äôt play. None of those combos work for that. Well ackshuallyyyy ass comment 62m going up to 90m with add-ons relating to winning PL and UCL. Don‚Äôt think those add ons can be applied or will ever get applied I agree. They are taking huge risks. I hope for the sake of the club they actually know what they are doing. But as you know, we sold the hotel and women‚Äôs team to BlueCo and we also count ticket sales, shirt sales, sponsorships, etc. toward the profits. That‚Äôs how we are complying so with FFP so far. But I also agree that it‚Äôs unsustainable if we continue to spend big. It seems like our policy is now to sell as much as we spend. Including Gallagher, Chelsea can probably generate around ¬£100 million in sales by they end of the window if they get deals over the line. Yeh I expect Lukaku and kepa to go this summer even if it means taking a hit. Boehly‚Äôs first summer screwed us the most with Fofana, Sterling and Cucurella getting overpaid too (nkunku got paid but he deserved it). Mudryk is overpaid but not terribly at around $90k/week but with Maresca‚Äôs system I think we‚Äôll see a loan with option next summer.   Chillwell and James are paid high but tbf you can‚Äôt get mad at that when you consider how instrumental they were with Tuchel plus being leaders. I definitely see Sterling, Chillwell, and potentially Fofana on the chopping block next summer. Our squad has grown in numbers and in depth of quality (albeit unproven) and wages have dropped significantly. Yeah it's definitely risky, we probably won't make a profit on all of them, but it'll average or okay.   On your other point, I think if it was going to get difficult for us to sell, it works have done already. We've 'needed to sell' fire the past two or three years, we just seem to be good at it. ¬£22m for Hutchinson or whatever it was, a lad who is clearly talented but has never properly player in the premier League, is a very good deal. Yeah I'm sure the club management has zero foresight. After all, multi billionaires are known for their lack of planning! Good thing we sell enough players to not take huge losses under FFP. Good to know, thanks! They're also not 600 m in debt. I know how to spot when a club is thoroughly incompetent, yeah lmao. It's only people who know absolutely nothing who need completely deference to people in power as an argument.  It's not that hard. >The fucking irony of this comment coming from anyone on /r/soccer lmao  People still don't recognise that criticism doesn't equal being capable of replacement. The same way people can rightfully criticise players without the ability to be on the pitch themselves, the same way you can hear when a piano player fucks up despite not being able to play the piece, the same way you can criticise someone turning into oncoming traffic if you don't drive.  This is, and has never been, complicated. I do not need to run a football club to watch someone fuck up running a football club. >I'm not sure I agree with you there, their squad composition is pretty clear and are even selling/buying players specifically to suit their composition  No it isn't. At all. They don't whether their midfield composition works and how to maximise particularly Enzo and Caicedo on a team level, they have an absolute mess of forwards with little cohesive idea of them playing together, they've spent ¬£90mil on GKs without a single one good enough to start, they've spent what, ¬£150mil on CBs without a single leader in the group, nor a central high volume passer.   I truly cannot express how bad their squad is, as a squad. Individually, great players. Together, not much more than just a group of guys.   >probably going have a David Fofana trajectory where they're sold with minimal minutes for Chelsea in order to fund other players.  Except that they're not going to all be sold for profit, they're not going to help the first team, and their funding more ineffectual transfers. They've spent ‚Ç¨1bil.   >buy a new first team squad that's young and locked in on long contracts, and then buy a load of youths that they sell for profit later on"". Which is also a long-term plan given the age of who they've bought  And it's fucking terrible lmao.   >but even last year they finished above Manchester United with the joint-youngest squad in Premier League history.  A 6th place finish above a team that played like 15 CB combinations because of injury is not a win.   >I think you're being far too critical and harsh of what's a long-term strategy - and one that's already starting to take shape.  It's only Chelsea fans that think this. This is the equivalent of driving into the oncoming lane of traffic to skip congestion, and Chelsea fans are going ""Oh well you can't tell if it's gonna work yet, so you can't comment.""  It's actually possible to recognise bad decisions in real time. Shocking. >You would know that those owners also own a baseball team, which also operates in an elite environment.  The fact you think these skills are transferable is laughable. But please tell me how footballing profiles and the way the transfer market which doesn't exist in US sports is an area of expertise for guys who own a baseball team.    >allowed people who have expertise in professional football related activities to run the operations of the club.    Is that why their strategy hasn't changed, and the manager last season fucked off because he didn't wanna work under them lmao?  >it does kill me when uninformed people arrogantly think they know best, but instead, it just makes them look stupid and ignorant  Again, it's only Chelsea fans who think this is some piece of genius. Everyone else who isn't drinking the kool-aid and knows anything can see this is a fucking car crash. >Did you watch him the year before he went to United or at United?  I'll ignore the silly logic that one bad season apparently means a player is no good. He was also struggling with injuries, as he also did last season.  >Oh lord...  Sorry, I forgot everyone was lauding Jackson for how clinical he was last season.  >Lol not even sure Arsenal fans would agree with that.   You should ask them. I'm pretty sure every fan would, considering we've seen basically nothing of Nkunku yet while Havertz won Chelsea a Champions League and challenged for the title with Arsenal last year.  >Still better than Ziyech.  Still doesn't play for you.  >The only position we've actually downgraded at is centerback and only because Thiago Silva can't be replaced.  You've spent ¬£1.2bn and I would argue Cole Palmer is the only player who breaks into any of the top 3 team's first XI, and even then that's debatable. Your squad looks no better than Spurs who haven't spent a fraction of that, or United who have been a laughing stock. Are you having a schizo moment? It's literally a direct response. If you're assisting every other game it's greatly diminished if you're playing half the games each season No, but just as goals and assists play into a players price. So does player availability [deleted] But that's kind of the point. They've changed tack multiple times.  1. Old experienced players. Didn't work coz they sacked Tuchel so quickly  Then 2. Expensive verging on elite players on long contracts . Like you say they then realised that's super risky coz if you get a bust you can't ship out like Mudryk then it's harder to manoeuvre in the market  3. Quantity over quality. Lots of middling players with potential but not many that have been good enough for the first team.  Now they seem to be moving back towards signing first team ready players like KDH and Neto.  Its been ridiculously chaotic and scattergun. The original comment was that they planned to spend like crazy in the first four years, and my point was just to say whatever plan they had coming in has been torn up and rewritten multiple times. My point is, I do not support the current approach of purchasing so much and bloating the squad.   Regardless of the quality of the players you purchase, a bloated squad will disrupt harmony and rapport. Players are friends with eachother and often pick sides, build cliques & become upset about their friends being benched(as they should).   It was one of the detrimental issues to Potter's reign (granted he was also at fault tactically but the bloated squad didn't help).   This feels all too familiar. New coach, large squad. Apparently the board is signing young players to develop them. Well, how will they develop when they are already in the market for their replacement but won't loan them out either.   Played Jackson one season and he showed promise albeit wasteful. What do we do? Go around and sign 2 more strikers. While chasing a 3rd in Victor.   I largely agree with you that it hasn't stopped the board from the uncontrolled spending but the problem is they have a very inconsistent approach to developing or improving the team. They should all together stop spending.   Sorry I'm speaking in circles here. We mostly agree on the issue. Because you said steady improvement 0 goals 0 assists isn‚Äôt improvement from the previous year, and it‚Äôs impossible to not improve on 0 goals and 0 assists. October to Boxing Day 2020 felt like 9 months at the time I guess we'll see. I agree with the assessment from The Athletic that we're probably the highest variance team. Finished 5 points off 4th last season, have some of our best players back from injury who barely kicked a ball last season like Nkunku and James, decent reinforcements in Neto, KDH, maybe Osimhen, younger players being more experienced etc.   But then you also have the new, relatively unproven manager, poor preseason results, whatever new injuries we might face etc. Honestly feel like we could finish anywhere between 3rd and 12th and I wouldn't be surprised. I mean even just isolating it to the one final against you lot there was the ""Blue billion pound bottlejobs"" line that was trotted out for weeks.  We're still getting lambasted at basically every opportunity (and rightly so for the bulk of it), it's just that there's plenty of other things to talk about in football besides us. >if he was available last year,  Except he wasn't. And the category was players not playinh  >Less than ¬£150mil, and again  ¬£80m plus ¬£70m isn't ¬£150m? And again, one was shit and the other never players soooooo....  >Lavia would be pretty close to starting  Again...  >nor were Kepa and Cucurella.  Except they were üòò  The tears are fantastic How many minutes did Lukaku and Nkuku play for you last season? How about lavia or fofana? Well you sounded like you wanted to know Why do you not have a Chelsea flair??? Sure and Gallagher will be the lion's share of that. Long term it doesn't seem like this approach can be successfull. Oh yeah, deffo wasn't throwing shade at Chilwell and James, on their day they're both amazing, just a shame they're spending so much time in the treatment room right now. Well football isn't exactly a financial instrument, and billionaires have also failed massively throughout history. Tbf, the net spend since Todd came in is 653 million pounds.   Obviously with the way some of those were amortised over 7 years it drops the yearly amount, but, you're going to HAVE to sell players yearly for a good price to not fall foul of the rules. !RemindMe 3 years [deleted] Well now you're just being biased and making stuff up.  >A 6th place finish above a team that played like 15 CB combinations because of injury is not a win.  Chelsea had as many if not more injuries than Manchester United did. They had an entire XI out injured for more than half the season, often better than the XI they started.  Enzo and Caceido are Maresca players - Enzo in particular, which is a large part of why they got rid of Poch. Enzo and Caciedo sitting behind Palmer or Nkunku, with Mudryk/Neto and Palmer/Madueke on the wings.  I don't know if you don't pay attention to Chelsea or just are looking for reasons to hate them but you're certainly *trying* to find things to bitch about.  Of course not all their players will be sold for profit - which is why I never said they would be. Sell one ¬£20mil player for ¬£50mil and you've covered a ¬£20mil player leaving on a free and then some. It's why they're buying numerous youngsters.  Fuck me, you speak as though last season Chelsea had zero injuries, every player at their peak and still fucked up. We had *half a billion pounds* worth of players out injured for large chunks of it, no fucking wonder we didn't do as well as we did - and still finished above Newcastle and Manchester United.  >It's only Chelsea fans that think this. This is the equivalent of driving into the oncoming lane of traffic to skip congestion, and Chelsea fans are going ""Oh well you can't tell if it's gonna work yet, so you can't comment.""  If we're doing stupid analogies, you've put a kettle on, touched it 3 seconds later and gone ""it doesn't work, whoever made this kettle is a fucking idiot lmao"" and chucking it away. Even if you rate Mount, he's not better than Nkunku or Palmer, so it's moot anyway because we upgraded.  >Sorry, I forgot everyone was lauding Jackson for how clinical he was last season.  So is how clinical you are the only way to rate a player? Come on, Jackson is considerably better than Werner and considerably more clinical than him too.  >You should ask them. I'm pretty sure every fan would, considering we've seen basically nothing of Nkunku yet while Havertz won Chelsea a Champions League and challenged for the title with Arsenal last year.  Nkunku and Havertz came from the same league and Nkunku was better in that league than Havertz. Besides, Nkunku played several games for us last season and was great. He's also been one of our best players this preseason. But you will see soon enough.  >Still doesn't play for you.  Confused as to what your point is. Neto has been better for Wolves than Ziyech was for us. He's clearly an upgrade on winger.  >You've spent ¬£1.2bn and I would argue Cole Palmer is the only player who breaks into any of the top 3 team's first XI, and even then that's debatable. Your squad looks no better than Spurs who haven't spent a fraction of that, or United who have been a laughing stock.  We haven't spent 1.2 billion. Addons do not count until they are reached. You're also conflating first team signings and youth signings. Angelo Gabriel is not a first team signing like Cole Palmer is.  But anyway, this just isn't even true lol. Any of Enzo, Caicedo and Lavia walk into Liverpool's first team lol, they went for all 3 of those players. They wanted Colwill too! Caicedo would walk into United and start over Mainoo. Shit, you'll see this season that Mainoo isn't even better than Lavia. Enzo would probably start for United as well. Gusto, our backup RB, is better than Pedro Porro and I rate Porro. I could keep going but Caicedo, Palmer, Lavia, Nkunku, Jackson, Enzo, Gusto, James, these are all players that would start for several top 6 teams.   If you paid attention to us last season, you'd know our biggest issue was injuries. If we were fit all season, we'd have finished top 4. We almost did even with the injuries. No, you are having a schizo moment I never once mentioned price, I only replied because people seem to think that Netos returns last season weren't great when in reality they were very good Netos assists are normally cut backs and crosses which I believe lowers that number, I don't think the stat is that great a measure tbh. Go look at the assists most are on a plate I get your point and what you are saying about the transfer strategy changing but I think after the first window the age component hasn‚Äôt change. Only how they are willing to dole out money. I also think that they are probably evolving as they get more experience with this transfer market. It‚Äôs different than any other sport on the planet. Mostly due to the fact that it is quite literally popular everywhere. I think we are in for some interesting years. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if in a few years, if their plans don‚Äôt work out, they cut their losses and sell. If it succeeds, we will be strong for a long period of time. At that point, it‚Äôll be interesting to see if they continue to go after younger talent or if they adopt a more hybrid approach. I definitely miss having veterans on the team. So many stupid mistakes and compounding errors that won‚Äôt go away if you keep having such a young squad. Ultimately, I respect your position, but I do have faith that there is a plan and that it‚Äôs going to take longer to see. I also will be the first to say that it doesn‚Äôt seem like it will work, but with the analytics and insider information they have- I‚Äôm hoping they know more than us. Yeah, I agree with everything you said. I just don't understand why your board keeps repeating the same thing. They're not morons, if they were they wouldn't be in these positions of running a club like Chelsea. There must be some end goal they are going towards. E was out almost all season that year due to injury. Convenient how you leave that out. But don't listen to me. Listen to the wolves fans. Or do you think you know better than them. Chill bro, we dont even care if Neto does not work out, we have like a millions other player in case he does not work out, know Estevao Willian, Kendry Paez, maybe Gabriel and a trillion other potential signings ? If Neto fails, sure we have a million more to replace him ahahahahah Aye good point there I completely forgot about that. Maybe I misspoke.  I think a lot of the narrative is just down to bewilderment about what you're even doing really rather than any real criticism but maybe I'm not getting a real perspective of it > needing to buy new players because **you don't want them to play** too many minutes.  >Except he wasn't. And the category was players not playinh  No, it wasn't.  >¬£80m plus ¬£70m isn't ¬£150mil  Mudryk wasn't ¬£80mil.  >Except they were üòò  ¬£75mil + ¬£60mil = ¬£150mil?! Go look at the original comment. ‚ÄúTwo players you don‚Äôt want to give minutes to‚Äù. Lukaku went out on loan, fair enough, but the other three players are integral when healthy (obviously been an issue). The point is the OP was trying to say Sterling and mudryk cost 150m. That isn‚Äôt true and people continue to say they did. You expanded the original comment but even then those players would be integral they just can‚Äôt stay healthy, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the same thing as injuries can happen to any team. The players they‚Äôre selling now aren‚Äôt a part of the new system.  The new system is more so players like Omari Hutchinson, David Datro Fofana, casedei, Angelo, Andre‚Äôs Santos.  The players were selling this year are primarily deadwood (Kepa, Lukaku) or academy graduates that weren‚Äôt good enough (Broja, Maatson, Hall) or ones being sold for the profit (Gallagher, Chalobah) You're right we will have to sell players every year, which is why we keep buying youth players like Anselmino. Gosh Chelsea fans have become a parody of themselves at this point? You just gonna defend whatever stupid shit they do with the idea ""Well *you* don't know how to run a football club, do you?"".  The idea only the people in leadership positions know how to think is how idiots live. >Chelsea had as many if not more injuries than Manchester United did. They had an entire XI out injured for more than half the season, often better than the XI they started.  And because they had a ginormous fucking squad, they ended up being better off. Chelsea should just have themselves and everyone else be injured too, great strategy. And again, regardless of United, Chelsea finished 6th. They've spent ‚Ç¨1bil. 6th.   >Enzo and Caceido are Maresca players - Enzo in particular, which is a large part of why they got rid of Poch. Enzo and Caciedo sitting behind Palmer or Nkunku, with Mudryk/Neto and Palmer/Madueke on the wings.  If you think these two work as a double pivot in a 4-2-3-1 I don't know what to tell you. Nowhere near enough calm and leadership, nor defensive discipline. But you're welcome to show me how it works without Lavia, and how that works without leaving other out in turn. Even with Lavia, there's still the issue of leadership and physicality.   >Of course not all their players will be sold for profit - which is why I never said they would be. Sell one ¬£20mil player for ¬£50mil and you've covered a ¬£20mil player leaving on a free and then some. It's why they're buying numerous youngsters  Where the fuck are these magical ¬£50mil transfers coming from? And you're welcome to do the math on how many need to be successes to cover the absurd amount spent, or why this strategy is more viable than just spending the money sensibly in the first place.   >We had half a billion pounds worth of players out injured for large chunks of it, no fucking wonder we didn't do as well as we did - and still finished above Newcastle and Manchester United.  Again, this isn't something to brag about. Both of these teams had significant injuries too, a much smaller squad to work with, and both have more encouraging and cohesive projects otherwise. It's a 6th place finish. It's not more than that.   >you've put a kettle on, touched it 3 seconds later and gone ""it doesn't work, whoever made this kettle is a fucking idiot lmao"" and chucking it away.  Except the problem is in your example, you're missing the point that the initial action is obviously illogical. It doesn't change anything to go ""Well we have to wait"" when the decision in the moment is obviously poor. >Even if you rate Mount, he's not better than Nkunku or Palmer, so it's moot anyway because we upgraded.  Mate you've seen Nkunku play about 10 mins of football. Mount was a Chelsea academy product who was your Player of the Season twice. Do Chelsea fans have any respect for their own club?  >Come on, Jackson is considerably better than Werner and considerably more clinical than him too.  Based on what? Last season they had a similar record of G/A per 90. Werner's best season at Chelsea landed him 23 G/A across all competitions, which is what Jackson got last season. Werner has had better seasons at Leipzig too.  >Nkunku and Havertz came from the same league and Nkunku was better in that league than Havertz.  Havertz left Germany four years ago when he was 21 and is younger than Nkunku, despite Nkunku only getting his big move last year. When Havertz left he was being touted as one of the biggest young talents in world football.  >He's also been one of our best players this preseason.  I don't doubt he's a good player, but pre-season means feck all. It's a bunch of friendlies against youth players and benchwarmers, and even then hasn't Chelsea's pre-season been awful?  >Neto has been better for Wolves than Ziyech was for us. He's clearly an upgrade on winger.  Neto hasn't played more than 20 league games in a season for Wolves since 2020.   >We haven't spent 1.2 billion. Addons do not count until they are reached. You're also conflating first team signings and youth signings.  I'm just adding up the totals listed online. You can argue it's a few million low or high, but it's over a billion anyway which is ridiculous. Money spent on youth players also counts. Why wouldn't it?  >Any of Enzo, Caicedo and Lavia walk into Liverpool's first team lol, they went for all 3 of those players.  Maybe Caicedo, but don't be stupid with the others. Liverpool and their midfield finished 20 points above Chelsea. Has anyone ever even seen Lavia play for Chelsea?  >Caicedo would walk into United and start over Mainoo.  I said they wouldn't get into any of the top 3's first teams. I don't know why you're talking about them getting into other teams when all I said was that Chelsea's squad doesn't look any better than them. That doesn't mean individual players from Chelsea wouldn't get in those squads, and vice-versa.  >If you paid attention to us last season, you'd know our biggest issue was injuries.  Same as United, same as Newcastle, same as Spurs, same as Liverpool. If my auntie had wheels she'd be a bike. Chelsea's biggest problem was that their squad is poor and inexperienced and they relied on Palmer to bail them out week-in, week-out. No but the person you responded to did. If you're not talking about price then how do you evaluate a transfer being good or bad? A player could score 5 goals as a striker but if he only cost a million that's a pretty decent ROI. [deleted] People are more used to Chelsea spending a lot of money in comparison to other teams >Mudryk wasn't ¬£80mil  You're right, he was 75 and as was fofana. Lukaku would be integral would he? Kepa?  If every one of those players would be integral then you'd play even worse than you do now. I listed 10 players, so in your head, chelsea would ideally play   Kepa   Fofana, cucurella  Caicedo/lavia/Enzo  Nkunku/Lukaku/Palmer/Mudryk  With one other player? Lol. > And because they had a ginormous fucking squad  What_year_is_it.gif  They didn't have a ginormous squad last year. I don't know why I'm arguing about the workings of Chelsea for someoe who seemingly gets their knowledge of Chelsea from outdated memes.  What next, *Vitesse lol?* >Mate you've seen Nkunku play about 10 mins of football. Mount was a Chelsea academy product who was your Player of the Season twice. Do Chelsea fans have any respect for their own club?  He played 400 minutes for us last season which isn't a lot obviously but was very good.   Mate, why are you arguing this. It doesn't matter if he won our player of the year twice, he isn't very good. I wanted him sold.  >Based on what? Last season they had a similar record of G/A per 90. Werner's best season at Chelsea landed him 23 G/A across all competitions, which is what Jackson got last season. Werner has had better seasons at Leipzig too.  Do you actually watch football or just look up g/a on wiki? Not a single person who watches Jackson and Werner would ever consider Werner equal to Jackson. Come on.   >Neto hasn't played more than 20 league games in a season for Wolves since 2020.  And he's still better than Ziyech.   >Maybe Caicedo, but don't be stupid with the others. Liverpool and their midfield finished 20 points above Chelsea. Has anyone ever even seen Lavia play for Chelsea?  Yeah they finished 20 points above us because Klopp is one of the greatest managers of all time and we had Poch. Caicedo is better than Endo. Fact.  >I said they wouldn't get into any of the top 3's first teams. I don't know why you're talking about them getting into other teams when all I said was that Chelsea's squad doesn't look any better than them. That doesn't mean individual players from Chelsea wouldn't get in those squads, and vice-versa.  Okay fair enough. You're right you said top 3 not top 6. I don't think Aston Villa will be top 3 again but when it comes to Man City and Arsenal, yeah fair not all of those players get into their team. But they've been building those squads for 5+ years and we've been building ours for 2 years.   >Same as United, same as Newcastle, same as Spurs, same as Liverpool. If my auntie had wheels she'd be a bike. Chelsea's biggest problem was that their squad is poor and inexperienced and they relied on Palmer to bail them out week-in, week-out.  Not all injury crises are the same. Liverpool missing Thiago, matip, Doak, and Bajcetic is not the same as us missing Reece James, Nkunku, Fofana, and Colwill, who are all starters for us. Talk to them about it them I prefer watching over stats, which is why I told you to go look, I've seen his assists and in most he is the main reason for the goal ¬£60mil plus add-ons for CL and PL, how many of those do you think he's got so far?  Besides:  >¬£80m plus ¬£70m isn't ¬£150m?  >Mudryk wasn't ¬£80mil.  >You're right, he was 75  for a ¬£60mil player. How TF are you moving the goalposts this much and *still* missing? Fofana, Cucurella, Caceido/Lavia/Enzo, Nkunku and Palmer all start if everyone's fit.  Cucurella, Caceido, Enzo and Palmer played most games they were available for last year, and Fofana/Nkunku/Lavia were injured all year.  Lukaku and Kepa are different kettles of fish - bought in under Abramovich. Lukaku isn't not playing due to performance, he was starting regularly until he did that stupid interview and torpedoed his career (and has since been moving from italian club to italian club). And Kepa was a panic buy after Courtois threw his toys out of  the pram a few days before the transfer window closed - he was too  expensive for what he is, but A) there's extenuating circumstances for that and B) the main reason we've replaced him is because Boehly & co want as few remnants of Abramovich-Era Chelsea as possible. In two years they sold all but two of the *squad* that won the Champion's League.  I know you're looking for reasons to hate Chelsea, but the players you're talking about don't actually match the argument you're trying to make. To be honest I think you‚Äôre being purposefully obtuse. I said that Lukaku went out on loan and that was obviously for a reason. That will likely happen again and is a non factor. For the rest of those players yes most of them will start or play most games. Not every integral player starts every game for every team. But outside of Lukaku Chelsea would love to see all of those guys getting big minutes >They didn't have a ginormous squad last year.  Yes, they absolutely did lmao. Chelsea senior squad size before this summer was already really big, as by the fact that basically exclusively senior players were given minutes. How many new academy grads played meaningful minutes, in an injury hit season? How many people were on loan because they couldn't get game time at Chelsea?   >the workings of Chelsea for someoe who seemingly gets their knowledge of Chelsea from outdated memes.  Alright dude. You continue to trust the process. I'm sure it'll work out great. Did you really just blame the poor season on injuries and then celebrate signing a player who misses 50% of games a season?  Also, Poch had you playing some cracking football at the end of the season, don't try and rewrite history.  Also on Mount 'it doesn't matter if he was our best player 2 years in a row, he isn't good'.. you offer a lot of absolutes which are based on nothing but opinion. Alright mate, you do you. Forgive me for thinking you weren't deviating massively from the topic at hand [deleted] The base amount was ¬£70m lol  > Chelsea will pay an initial ¬£70m [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11661/12683698/wesley-fofana-chelsea-complete-signing-of-leicesters-french-defender-in-gbp75m-deal) and if you're arguing over what the exact bonuses were then you can show me the contract any time you want Honestly, I'm amazed Chelsea fans are so happy to defend the people running the club because you're going exactly down the same route as Napoli/Lazio/Parma did which led to them being placed in administration.  Good riddance tho. Couldn't happen to a more deserving club Again, to use the comparison to Manchester United - a comparison that *you* started, by the way.  As a team that you're claiming can't be compared to Chelsea last season because of how many injuries they had, Manchester United had what, Kambwala and Hannibal that were not expected to play, didn't do well enough to stay in the squad afterwards (unlike Garnacho and Mainoo) and had >100 minutes?  Conversely, Chelsea had Ugochukwu and Gilchrist?  >How many new academy grads played meaningful minutes, in an injury hit season?  How many Manchester United youth CBs played meaningful minutes in a season that, as you say, they had 15 different CB pairings?  Chelsea at times had Chilwell or Cucurella as a LW. They played Enzo or Gallagher as their CAM because both Nkunku and Chukwuemeka were out. They didn't play youth for prolonged minutes, because they played players out of position instead, *exactly as every other club does*.  I've mentioned bias before - but how many youth players did Liverpool play last season? Newcastle had massive injuries and only played one youth player for a prolonged stretch (Lewis Miley), do you think they have a more ""ginormous"" squad than Chelsea?  You're picking odd metrics, looking for things to get angry *with Chelsea* about, do you apply the same level of criticism to other teams too or is it only ones you dislike? I wasn't deviating, you were though He's a very good player, you've just got your back up because your a spurs fan and I used one of your players as an example Oh my god, your own links don't even say what you're claiming.  >he was 75 and as was fofana.  >Chelsea will pay an initial ¬£70m for Wesley Fofana  [Talking about Mudryk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64281139#:~:text=Chelsea%20have%20completed%20the%20signing,for%20Chelsea%2C%22%20said%20Mudryk.) ¬£62mil base.  So tell me again how ¬£70mil + ¬£5mil in addons, plus ¬£62mil = ¬£150mil? Ok so does that mean that you can‚Äôt name two players that were worth a combined 150m that Chelsea doesn‚Äôt want to give minutes to? Because that‚Äôs the whole point of this discussion and now you‚Äôre changing the subject. >a comparison that you started, by the way.   A comparison to *United's previous owners* in terms of *attitude towards squad composition*. If this is the level of reading compression, to see that and go ""Well ackshually United finished below Chelsea last season"", then seriously man, this conversation isn't worth anything to anyone.   >Conversely, Chelsea had Ugochukwu and Gilchrist  Even in this, you mentioned a first team signing? How much did Ugochukwu cost? More than ¬£20mil total package, right? Do you see the issue here on Chelsea's suboptimal spending when you need to include ¬£20mil signings in   >How many Manchester United youth CBs played meaningful minutes in a season that, as you say, they had 15 different CB pairings  Can you see the difference in raw quality between Kambwala as an academy player and Evans vs Badiashile or Disasi? Do you understand academy players and free transfers being the back-up options over ¬£40mil players? When I saw squad bloat, it's not just raw numbers (which I should have mentioned before tbf), it's dedicated first team signings with significant costs (and relatively significant wages compared to other teams' last ditch options) that don't need to be there, particularly given they don't represent a balanced squad anyways.  >Chelsea at times had Chilwell or Cucurella as a LW.  These two are width holding fullbacks in possession. Them playing ""LW"" was them doing what they've both done for significant portions of their careers, playing as a wingback.   >They played Enzo or Gallagher as their CAM because both Nkunku and Chukwuemeka were out.  Do you understand what you're saying here? You understand Gallagher as of right now is a better 10 than Chuk is? This was essentially one injury to a starting quality player, and one injury to a youth prospect you spent too much money on. And instead of signing a 5th CB for good squad player money, you coulda signed an actual squad quality 10, but instead tried to trust Chuk? This chain of comments wasn't talking about the price then? Because it was before you replied to me... [deleted] Show me what the bonuses were. He's closing in on 50 appearances, there's bound to be bonuses tied to that, goals, appearances in Europe, etc.  You're claiming shit with 0 evidence and then getting whiny when someone else proves you wrong. No I can, Lukaku and kepa. That's 160m right there as a conservative guess as Chelsea fans seems to like Bro, there's a million replies talking price, go post on those Maddison was excellent before his injury... >You're claiming shit with 0 evidence and then getting whiny when someone else proves you wrong.  Show me he's met the bonuses if that's what you mean, how TF have you ""proved me wrong"" by just crying ""chelsea bad"" with exactly as much evidence?  >makes a claim   >shows no evidence for claim   >""You're mad I proved you wrong"" So two players that were purchased by the old owners? That doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative [I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/272SpE36pC) [deleted] Please go outside lol. Works done, so I don't need to waste any of my free time arguing over numbers neither of us can confirm or deny.  You want to spend Friday night debating that then you do you. My narrative is Chelsea is going down the shitter. It's a very easy narrative to form given they are in fact going down the shitter financially and on the pitch Good man He had an injury that kept him out for months, it's not surprising that he wasn't 100% after. And with England they have so many great players in his position he wouldn't have got a call up anyway >You want to spend Friday night debating that then you do you.  Which is why you've posted to go ""I'm not arguing any more"". If you're done just leave it, don't try and get the last word in...  Besides, can't go outside yet, I'm still in the office. I'd love to, TBH, sun shining and a pitcher of cocktails would be the dream but work ain't finished... Sorry you aren‚Äôt able to stay on the subject. Keep dreaming that is going to happen I guess might see a familiar face there. [deleted] Awwww. You can always become a Millwall fan.

Wait till I get involved Watch him no longer be injury prone as soon as he joins City Well he's another Gestifute client isn't he? No surprise they've got a good relationship, they've already got 4 of their clients on the books with Ederson, Dias, Silva and Nunes. Urgh, please don't. He would 100% be at a Man City or big side had he not suffered so many injuries the last 3 seasons. That's the big risk when you buy him is keeping him fit. Why do they need more wingers??? Already have doku grealish foden Bernardo bobb Amazing how whenever a player finds some form he immediately gets linked with half the super league clubs. He's on a long term deal, 100 mil or piss off Oh cool ruin the new year with news of Neto possibly leaving so he can model sideline apparel with Nunes Wolves the former Portuguese england team and now city the new portuguese england team Ngl, hoped for him at spurs. Seems like a great player to fit into anges system I hate 2024 already He‚Äôs the only player I‚Äôve seen destroy Ake in 1v1 duels for City in the last two seasons. There‚Äôs no way Pep was going to let the other top 5 get their hands on him. Manchester City can fuck right off. Didn't they used to call this ""tapping up""? Liverpool wake up! Sign Nunes to butter up the following Neto deal. Brilliant ¬£120m Kindly F off. Poor Wolves :( How does Pip do it? Genius. üôÑ Fuck off, you oil rats. How long till Pep coaches all the excitement and dynamism out of him?   Then he'll move onto the next one Unreal.  The abuse I got on the United sub for saying I‚Äôd prefer Neto to Rashford early this season.   Wow. [deleted] there‚Äôs a few issues with it:  - Neto‚Äôs not the winger you buy for defensive abilities because of Walker‚Äôs decreasing pace (even though they have other fullbacks who have pace still) - a 23 year old with 3 years left on his contract who‚Äòs only just lost the top assister title in the PL despite having been out for 2 months is only valued at ‚Ç¨8-13m? Yeh right üòÇüòÇ - Neto‚Äôs said he‚Äôs staying put and won‚Äôt be leaving in Jan, now he‚Äôs suddenly said that he wants to leave at the end of the season because city are interested? Seems like more big 6 bias journalism imo.  - If City are after defensively sound wingers to help with defensive cover for Walker they‚Äôve already got Doku, Grealish and Foden as well as some of the best CBs and best CDM in the world World class manager. Who else could score goals with KDB Haaland Bernado Silva and Rodri. Come to spurs  Very very false That is a good enough replacement for Bernardo silva when he leaves this summer English Premier League is farcical Another young winger? Foden's career is going to keep stagnating until de Bruyne leaves, isn't it > Steven Kay  Spoofer. In the bin it goes. Fantastic player, would love him at Spurs but he is very injury prone. So tilting because I wanted him over Anthony at United.  Please sign Soule then..... Not sure how I feel about this since Matheus hasn‚Äôt really shown much not on my watch Load management Frustrating to be linked with a guy who‚Äôs gonna make me excited but has been injured for like 2 full years out of the last 4. Not that his injuries are much better but I‚Äôd prefer olise It's ironic considering RW is the only position where the player would get more minutes at City than Arsenal Arteta needs to get on top of that You lot could buy anyone at RW and Arteta would still have Saka out there breaking his legs It‚Äôs just plain unfair, literally any player they want they can pay their way to. It‚Äôs just worse for the league when a team can just throw money at any player they want. Gundo, cancelo, Laporte gone, no prob throw money at gvardiol, Nunez & doku City‚Äôs powers grow the more they can rotate. I reckon Foden wants to shift centrally and this signing might be a vote of confidence to him from the club too. Bernardo also might not be staying for much longer. He has a release clause that activates this coming summer None of those other than Bobb are natural RW‚Äôs. There is a reason why Bernardo currently starts on the right even though he‚Äôs better in a central role. bernardo soon to be leaving and foden transitioning into a more central role this season. plus the club like to bring in players early if they can so they have a year to settle Why do they need more wingers? Proceeds to name two wingers and some midfielders. Right wing weaker than left wing for sure Bernardo starts more in midfield I thought, and Grealish is a different profile to Neto. Then the rest are at the same level as Neto None of them are a replacement for Mahrez I have to believe the long-term vision for Foden is playing in the midfield. Bernardo is a Swiss Army knife, but mainly a midfielder It wouldn't surprise me if we sell for something like ¬£50-60m and removing/lowering the 50% sell on clause for Tommy Doyle. I feel like it's going to be an ongoing effort to have good relations with City considering the strength of their academy and those who won't quite be good enough for their first team but would be for us. He's been in good form for years now, barring the periods when he literal couldn't play.  The guy is either great, or injured. No inbetween Gestifute will bully you into selling him for peanuts Bye Interest has been there [for a while?](https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/football-rumours-arsenal-among-several-clubs-interested-in-wolves-pedro-neto-1533999.html)? I feel like I've only watched Neto when he plays LW, how has he been on the right? >Ngl  We appreciate you not lying Makes sense, there were rumours about Kingsley Coman until the Bayern game I‚Äôm sure we can all agree on this. Two utterly crooked clubs, the relationship makes perfect sense And now we can start thinking about our response to that bid for Pedro Neto too... Tapping up hasn't been policed for about 20 years They want olise to be salah‚Äôs successor. Nah he's too injury prone, also no more look down dribblers please Oh no, an irrelevant journalist has suggested that a super league club might be interested in one of our star players, how will we ever recoverü•≤ Fuck them, they‚Äôve gotten where they are by being crooked as sin and now their crook owners have decided to jump in bed with even bigger crooks Some cash could ease your sorrows Keep crying *Doku exists* do you think Grealish would rather have the treble or dynamism? All clubs do it tbh > What ever happening to the term tapping up?  Tapping up requires unauthorised contact directly between a club and  a player/player's agent. These days, that basically never happens. Players, and clubs, have intermediaries who aren't ""officially"" their agent, who sound out possible deals.   It also sounds like City have a good relationship with Hobbs so they might have just asked if there's a deal that could be done. It'd only be tapping up if Wolves said ""no we will not sell him under any circumstances, go away"". >It seems City tries to arrange deals with players then force clubs to sale at there value  That's what every club tries to do? And it doesn't work if the player is willing to go to another club. See the Rice transfer in the summer, where Arsenal thought that Rice only wanted to go to Arsenal, City went in with a higher bid and in the end Arsenal had to pay way over the odds. clubs stopped doing it and modified their behaviour to instead do something very very like it but not quite it. It's just accepted now. Once you're not a dick about it. That's how it works for every transfer. Clubs and agents are constantly in touch with each other, hell clubs are constantly in touch with each other. There is a big informal part of player sales that takes part before the official stuff.  It's not football manager where you negotiate with the club then the player. They don't want to waste time chasing a player that's not keen or hold talks with a player if the club isn't gonna budge.  I think in a modern context that tapping up is only really trying to get a player to not renew and run down their deal. Man City: Does anything.  r/soccer: Wait, that's illegal. Bullet points or not   * You * are  * ill * informed * and * incorrect [deleted] Bernando is not leaving and Neto is not similar at all Dr Cugat‚Äôs secret sauce. Makes me wonder how Palmer would've developed if he stayed.  Still nice to see him thriving. I dunno, Saka is obviously locked in starter but he looks like he needs someone who can help out and give him rest and they don‚Äôt really have a left footed winger to do that God I‚Äôve wanted us to sign him for two years, perfect for us to get some rotation for saka before he falls apart After Saka‚Äôs performances this season, I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure. How is that ironic? All of the top English clubs can do that? Even the other ones can pay their way to any player except world class ones. Yes and no. There are what, 5 teams in the PL that can (and do) spend anything they want for a player.  City isn‚Äôt actually any worse than any of the other top Prem teams.   Hell, Arsenal just outbid us for Rice who would‚Äôve been a fantastic addition to a struggling midfield.  We also paid 55 million for Doku, it wasn‚Äôt like it was an unbeatable offer.  There are plenty of players (usually 1-2 high profile ones every year) that we get outbid on even if we really wanted them. City has always generally looked for good deals, with the occasional splash (Grealish and Gvardiol). Same sentiment about all the PL teams So can any of the top prem teams. Players want to go to City because they're a functional team They won treble when Pep actualy stopped rotating and was playing same 12-13 players every 3 days. r/FantasyPL 9/11 This is actually a pretty good theory, I think Bernardo will leave next summer, and Neto would be that replacement, allowing Foden to stay central. The problem is we have too many player who are good central attackers. Silva, Foden, and Julian are all natural central attackers, but they can‚Äôt all play at the same time there.  Idk, I don‚Äôt think we are in as much need for a RW as others do. Foden and Silva both play wonderfully on the wing, and if Bobb continues his progression he‚Äôll be a great starter too.  Obviously depth is great, but our midfield and right back is the biggest need going forward. Walker is literally on his last legs and KDB is getting old. who tf is bobb >bernardo soon to be leaving  Timetraveller 1: ""We did it! We came back in time""  Timetraveller 2: ""Yeah! But what year is it?""  Timetraveller 1: ""Dunno. Let's ask that guy over there""  Guy over there: ""It's the year Bernardo was said to be leaving City""  Timetraveller 1: ""..."" Bernardo is never going to leave lol, he'll probably be still at the club when Halaand retires from football. Maaaan Bernardo is always on his way out, then he's always back in. I'm starting to think he will retire an old man with City, but still be available for 40m lol I've heard that Foden is transitioning in a more central role for years but it seems Pep only plays him there when he has to. He's always looked best as a winger for me. Yeah but they can‚Äôt all start in the midfield. Also Grealish is absolutely a Left Winger/Midfield. He always plays great out to the side. He CAN play more centrally, but he‚Äôs much better breaking down the defense from the wing.  So we‚Äôve got Doku and Grealish for LW; Bobb for RW, and Silva/Foden/Julian for CAM. Unless we lose 1-2 of Silva/Foden/Julian, idk that it really makes sense to try and grab another RW He's definitely had some patches where he wasn't anywhere near as good as he has been this season. But also the team as a whole had problems during that time as well. Didnt know you were on reddit Mr Mansour Happened with van dijk Feels like Palace never let go of their top rated players, not that they're obliged to, but I guess they're in a decent financial position where they can afford to retain their best players. Put some respect on Steve Kay, man's a don. Congratulations on being a fool. Cry into a huge pile of money. And is in the process of having his excitement and dynamism coached out of him I don't care about what Grealish wants I care about being excited by watching football I mean, what you're doing is illegal, but there isn't really any club that doesn't do it.  Basically, it's only illegal if you get caught. It‚Äôs one person, get a sense of perspective. Oh no I gave logic against why a report doesn‚Äôt seem true for a big 6 club despite them being the only one to report it and not seeming reputable, so therefore I have to be incorrect üôÑ care to tell me why I‚Äôm ill informed and incorrect or are you gonna leave it with some sarcastic comment that you clearly thought was funny but it‚Äôs not? I‚Äôm a wolves fan so watch a lot of Neto, I‚Äôve got a mate who‚Äôs a city fan and even he says that Neto seems a great player but would be a strange fit at city.   Matt Hobbs and Pedro Neto themselves have both said that he‚Äôs very happy at Wolves and isn‚Äôt immediately eyeing up a move. So please tell me who to believe over Wolves‚Äô sporting director and the actual player or some journalist I‚Äôve never heard of who‚Äôs quite clearly stretched an article that basically says he‚Äôs not leaving in January but there‚Äôs a chance he could leave in summer just to adhere to the big 6 bias fans who believe no other clubs are allowed good players but them?   As a wolves fan I‚Äôve seen it year on year with every good player we‚Äôve had and only 2 of them have gone to a big 6 club in recent times Bernardo rarely plays on the right, he's primarily a midfielder and it's the position at which he excels at the most. Don't think this is related to him in any way [the reference](https://youtu.be/Bh7A7T5GnSo?si=sQ92PBMdMFkB3FeJ) You guys and psg surely will try to buy Bernardo silva he put a release clause in his contract for a reason They should tell him to give some to KDB and Stones. I could never be a city player, I don‚Äôt care how much secret under the table extra cash they offer me I‚Äôm never shoving horse placenta into any of my body-holes It‚Äôs clear that Palmer has the dawg in him. I think he got pushed out because he probably didn‚Äôt want to wait and was causing a bit of a ruckus Jesus has historically been good on the right flank.  Nelson, Trossard, Havertz can also play there.    It's not that there aren't players that could potentially rest Saka, it's that Arteta plains refuses to.  If you brought Arteta a time machine, he would time-snatch prime Robben and young Messi and sit them both on the bench. People also need to remember that Saka is only 22 years old and he's still put up 9+12 in 26 games for Arsenal this season. His output hasn't changed actually which is why  mikel will use every last fiber in those legs Come on man he‚Äôs clearly the best RW in the league /s Right. As if Chelsea didn't spunk over a billion on a whole new team, and Arsenal didn't blow 70m on Havertz. It isn't the amount of money City's rivals spend, it's how they squander it that keeps City on top. Nah I‚Äôd say United (maybe not after Ratcliffe) & Chelsea are the only teams that can financially compete with City, United as much as it hurts to say earned their way to the top throughout decades of being number 1. Not an immediate injection of cash by literal states.  Arsenal didn‚Äôt outbid you for Rice, he just wanted to stay in London.  Saying City & the occasional splash is just plain false. I think Pep is part of it. But, let's be honest with why Fity is a draw. They pay the most money. Flat out. Their Financials when it comes to payroll are a little funky. Cumulative effect of the mystical powers generated by years of rotation. and got KDB and later Haaland injured that way tbf Pep got into the SR scene after No Sub November This is a summer transfer, at which point Bernardo will likely be gone. At that point, Bobb is the only natural RW and Pep isn‚Äôt going to trust him to have 40 starts the season after he gets introduced to the first team. We‚Äôll need someone who provides a natural winger skillset for the right, especially if Phil is finally transitioning into his long term position in central midfield. Sure he can do the Bernardo role of going back and forth, but we need depth there. I look at a player like Neto as our choice to replace Mahrez. Oscar Bobb. He‚Äôs a really talented 20 year old starting to get really first team play this year. If he continues progressing the way he is he‚Äôll be a locked in starter in the next couple of years. ü§® well unlike Mahrez look like Bernando is quite happy to stay at City for a while. Don't give me hope like that, I never want to see him go Pep really likes Center Mid/Winger hybrids for tactical flexibility. Players like Bernardo, Foden, Graelish, and David Silva can play both spots at quite a high level.   There are four Midfield/winger spots between Rodri and Haaland. They spend next to nothing in the window, maybe because they put their money into retention instead Yeah tbf it is notable that he was the first to report Gabriel Jesus' transfer from Manchester City to Manchester City B It's just a process all players have to go through when joining teams that keep two thirds of the possession and play 80% of the game in opposition half who've parked the bus.  Most of that excitement and dynamism you're talking about comes from counter attacks. Are you saying de Bruyne and Bernardo Silva are boring? and noone cares what you want lol It's only illegal if you talk to the players agent about finances and don't have permission from the club. Informal talks happen all the time in football. If it were illegal like you posted, we wouldn't hear any transfer rumours at all. How is it tapping up if they‚Äôre communicating with the club Everything you wrote with your bullet point list is your opinion and hearsay. He's started 7 of his 15 starts as RW jn the prem this season. An almost 50% split is far from 'rarely plays' He will go to Benfica for free We have much more pressing needs and his release clause is still far too high for us in our current financial state. And Duku. I'm fairly certain they are not offering you anything, so it seems things worked out perfectly for both parties. The horse placenta was an external thing, you'd use it like a salve  Wasn't just a City thing, either. Horse placenta was a trend as big as cutting holes in the back of your socks, once upon a time Well you gotta actually be talented to play for us This made me laugh, idk why you were downvoted so much That‚Äôs exactly what happened. Pep said he told him now Mahrez had left he‚Äôd get chances but Palmer wanted to leave, I think it‚Äôs a transfer that suits everyone, I‚Äôm not sure Palmer would be showing these levels if he didn‚Äôt go to Chelsea and immediately become a key starter I‚Äôm pretty sure I saw Pep say in a conversation with him that he will get his chance now but he insisted to move to Chelsea and they didn‚Äôt stop him It‚Äôs sad because this was the season where pep was gonna fully integrate Palmer. But thankfully Oscar Bobb looks every b  it as good and maybe more suited to the system. Yeah not knocking him at all but we are seeing the results of playing him every game. There‚Äôs only so much he can carry us. If you take pens and dead ball assists away, Sakas G/a is very underwhelming visually. A lot of tap ins. Which is good, sterling was great at it, but not if you don‚Äôt play well which Saka is not this season. It‚Äôs all about expectations. If Saka is going to be on Bale / Hazard type of trajectory, he is not doing too hot this year, but if the expectations are to be closer to Pedro / Willian, he is more than fine People are just so desperate for saka to fail. He gets booed everywhere we go. I genuinely think he‚Äôs low key one of the most hated players in the league. Saka is fine, Martinelli is the one who is more surprising, but he‚Äôs also only 22.  Nowadays everyone always panics if someone isn‚Äôt Messi or Ronaldo by 22 lol. Man will be graying at 26 > a billion on a whole new team  > 70m on Havertz  yeah sounds about exactly the same thing A) Arsenal literally outbid us for Rice.  B) Arsenal have the 3rd largest net spend and 5th largest spend in the last 5 years, and I believe are 2nd in both categories in the last 2 years.  C) I guess it depends on what you mean by big splash. He was rotating the bench supporters so they could shout louder. worth Didnt he have a fantastic pass that lead to a goal a couple of days ago? Of the four you named only Bernardo strikes me as someone I've seen as comfortable wide as he is central.  Dilva could play on wing but was predominantly used (at City) in attacking mid. Similarly Grealish and Foden can play centrally but at City have looked the most comfortable wide. Yes. > informal talks    ""Oi bruv, would be nice if you were on 350 K/week, huh?üòè""  ""Eh mate, 400 would be even better üòâ""  ""Right üòâ"" Well it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs based on fact. Neto only has 3.74 successful defensive actions per 90 which isn‚Äôt that great so no you don‚Äôt buy Neto for defensive cover. Having watched him at Wolves he‚Äôs often the outlet to break on the counter rather than back defending. It‚Äôs fact he‚Äôs 23 and it was only this last round of fixtures that Salah and Watkins moved to 8 assists (finally knocking him off the top on 7). Given he‚Äôs regarded as one of the most promising wingers in the league because of his assists, high duel and dribble success rate (which are also facts) and has 3 years left on his contract (which is also a fact) it‚Äôs an educated guess that he‚Äôs worth more than ‚Ç¨8-13m as we‚Äôve seen far worse players go for far more. It‚Äôs also a fact he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs not leaving in Jan and once again it‚Äôs an educated guess that there‚Äôs not much substance to this article if you look at how it‚Äôs written, it‚Äôs very contradictory.   So no, nothing I‚Äôve really said is just my opinion or hearsay as it‚Äôs all based off facts Due of the availability issues of the rest of the squad? Kev, Rodri and Bernardo is our starting midfield though we do play him out wide in big matches because he's so safe in possession Master Kenobi, you disappoint me Yup. Seems like a great deal for everyone involved. I know we don‚Äôt have a true right winger, but our attack is so crowded I‚Äôm not sure Palmer would‚Äôve gotten that much time. With Grealish and Doku having the left side pretty much locked up, the right side is often where Foden or Silva get stuck. Putting Palmer there would just have made the formation even more complicated. Palmer would've balled at city for sure. But still a win win for both the clubs, considering city got 45 mil in return.  Oscar bobb is one to watch out for, kid has it in him to make it to the first team. Quality player. If you're looking at all of his stats in 2023/2024 Premier League, it's still very good. 95% percentile in shot-creating actions (the only players who are better: Odegaard, Maddison, Olise). His npxG + xAG per 90 is 0,58, second best at Arsenal (only behind Jesus 0,60). He's third in key passes (only behind Trippier and Fernandes).   Plus, Arsenal needs players who can get them easy goals. Doesn't matter how they look.   There's a lot of good things with Saka, even if he's having a few worse weeks lately.      https://fbref.com/en/players/bc7dc64d/scout/12192/Bukayo-Saka-Scouting-Report At his age it‚Äôs all still up in the air, it can even come down to how much he wants to be the best by working to hone his talent.   22 year old Salah was not on track to become 31 year old Salah for example. Saka will be a very good player if he becomes as good as Pedro, I wouldn't even put Pedro and Willian in the same bracket necessarily either, I think Pedro was a better player. It‚Äôs cause English football want another sterling to abuse, but saka hasn‚Äôt let them. He's one of the most respected players in the league what are you on about. Home fans boo every opposition player especially if they're the star, nobody hates saka apart from racists and spurs fans The Rashford special. My point was that the teams challenging City, or who should be challenging City, are squandering their money, augmenting City's trophy haul beyond what it should be. Literally every soccer fan thought the Havertz deal was stupid, except Arsenal, and the results were as predictable as death and taxes. Yes, great pass to Foden through a few defenders who then passed it across goal for Alvarez to tap in You must‚Äôve never seen Grealish and Foden in the midfield gliding through people Nothing to do with the availability of the squad. Could easily play Foden there and put Bernardo in the center even now but Pep isn't doing that. It's a tactical decision Pep has made with the team. Even if Doku comes back, I expect Grealish to drop out and Bernardo to continue on the right. That was my thought too on reading the comment. It works in theory but given no false 9 anymore and KDB/Bernardo being almost undroppable, suddenly there isn‚Äôt much room for a lot of incredible players   Foden, Alvarez and Doku being able to play a wide variety of forward roles is more than enough to fill the position really Yea of course there‚Äôs a lot of good things. He‚Äôs very talented. He helps win games even when he‚Äôs poor. The problem is, he‚Äôs not actually playing well in the full 90. He needed to elevate after last season but he‚Äôs regressing. His stats may stay the same. But performances are way down True - but the expectations for Salah at 22 weren‚Äôt the same. Saka is getting paid - and getting opportunities - like he will be Salah in 2-3 years I've noticed Liverpool fans recently  Maybe it was the incident with Tsimikas, I'm not 100 percent sure.  He's been in their cross hairs recently. It's borderline to me. Havertz may not be everyone's cup of tea but signing a 24 year old PL proven player who's won a CL and played almost every available minute for us is not squandering money   You also fail to point out that we spent 100m on Rice who's quietly been one of the best MFs in the PL   The difference with City is they have been able to do the spending other clubs get to do in short periods (in Arsenal's case since Kroenke took over 100%) for a longer time (due to financial doping) and have acquired better players who also generate great signing fees giving them the ability to sign the best players, they have played the transfer market amazingly and to so it's just because other teams spent poorly is too simplistic Wdym? Foden plays in the middle cause there's no Kev and hence no real source of creativity. Bernardo's played most of his time here in the middle which makes sense since he's a very good winger but he's world class as a midfielder. English tax explains some of the wages, the homegrown rule means top English clubs will always massively overpay for English players just in case  I suppose the ready is the same old story - there‚Äôs too much money at stake for owners and upper management to risk not throwing everything at the wall to see if it sticks. If saka makes it to the very top great, if he doesn‚Äôt he won‚Äôt the first and certainly won‚Äôt be the last young lad with promise broken by the football system we‚Äôve got going on here >Saka is getting paid and getting opportunities like he will be Salah in 2-3 years  Saka is earning what a top PL winger should be earning in this day and age maybe even less when you consider players like Rashford and Antony. Foden has played on the wing more than Bernardo has for City in the past few seasons. So with KDB out, the logical thing would be to play Bernardo there as he's comfortable there, has played the KDB role before and has the right skill set for the role. The illogical, risky move is playing Foden there as Foden hasn't played in the center for an extended period since City played a false 9 around 2/3 years ago. And, even then, he played further up the field than KDB tends to do.  Yet it's Foden in the center of the pitch and Bernardo on the wing. Which indicates to me that Bernardo isn't playing on the wing because of player availability, but because of tactical reasons. Ones that seem to be working as Foden has been killing it in KDBs absence recently.  Also, no one is talking about where Bernardo's played 'most of his time here'. We're talking about this season as where he played in past seasons is irrelevant when discussing his potential competition if a new winger comes in. In the summer when everyone will be back? A winger would hardly be Bernardo's replacement if he leaves it'll be another midfielder Firstly, you're wrong. If a player who plays as a winger for half his matches leaves, a replacement will need to be brought into the first team. This might be from the academy by promoting Bobb for more games or by buying a new player from elsewhere but you can't just leave the same players you have and expect them to not burn out from the work load.  Secondly, none of what you've said contradicts what I've said even if it was true. Bernardo has still played a large portion of games as a winger due to tactical reasons. We have like 2 natural wingers man, why would this guy be anyone's replacement? He'd just be an addition. And why wouldn't you replace one of our best mids with another mid? At what point have I said they won't get a midfielder as well? All I've said is it leaves a gap at winger that will need to be filled. And, as to why Bobb would be a replacement, maybe because he's been trained since he was first put in the academy to play in a pep system and in his limited time on the pitch with the first team hasn't looked out of place. >At what point have I said they won't get a midfielder as well?  So the Neto signing is nothing to do with Bernardo's future like I've been saying? And Bobb is good prospect but we can't rely on them to compete at the highest level consistently No, the Neto signing could be a sign that Bernardo might be leaving as there will be a gap at winger. There will just also be a gap in midfield. Which goes against what you are saying.  And the same was said about Palmer this summer and now he's killing it at Chelsea while we're talking about who will play the position Palmer would be playing right now. Need to give the youth a chance. I mean Palmer still wouldn't start for us. Also there already is a gap at winger so we're obviously already looking at it. Giving youth a chance is great but you can't expect them to be starters when you're competing at the highest level. Also this is too pedantic a discussion for a basic statement as 'Bernardo is not really a winger'. The way he's been playing for Chelsea, he'd start for City now. You say obviously but City needed a LB for years and just adapted the role. It's never cut and dry they'd go into the market if Bernardo stayed. Giving youth a chance is the reason Foden is who he is now, it's the reason Rico has broken into the team and it is the reason Palmer went for ¬£40m despite only playing a handful of games. How are you meant to get the best out of youth players if you provide no path to the first team?  Except Bernardo was a winger for Monaco, was a winger for Benfica, was a winger when he started at City, has played winger in the most important matches at City such as champions league semi finals and many cup finals. He's a versatile player who has a skill set that allows him to be world class on the wing and in the center."

Sterling getting registered back into PL squad on deadline day with number 99 is gonna hit different Should give Palmer the #10 while you're at it While city are re-signing players Chelsea are resigning players Feel for Chalobah here, he‚Äôs not done anything wrong to be treated like this Boy I would love a All or Nothing Chelsea version. So is mudryk keeping the 10? Didn't Neto debut with a different number on Sunday? How can he switch it? ‚ÄúIt is not a mess‚Äù   -Maresca Pedro's gonna look fire in that 11 games he'll play well that was quick Have they only recently decided that Sterling was surplus to requirements?   Why was he allowed on the pre season tour if they didn‚Äôt want him ? Chelsea running out of numbers to give out I do not understand why would any player sign for Chelsea if they see how are treating their current players like this. Next season : new young winger ‚Äòwith potential‚Äô Will wear number 7. Pedro Neto is not in plans This is some low moves by Chelsea. Damn‚Ä¶ ruthless club. It's actually incredible that Chelsea have a 46-man squad but no #9. This club really have no chill whatsoever. Chelsea is about to learn how hard it is to sell actual deadwood. Part of the reason they got good sales was because they often got out in front of it.   Take Havertz and Mount as examples. The year before they moved they were (iirc) Chelsea‚Äôs 1/2 most played players. They even had more minutes than the keeper which is rare for outfielders. Chelsea projected they would move them out of the main squad and instead sold them for solid fees *before* that happened.   Now that these players are publicly sidelined I fully expect their value to drop and Chelsea are not going to be able to get the kind of fees Chelsea‚Äôs reputation implies that they would. Stripping players of their squad numbers will never not be gross This club is absolutely vile That foul, at least wait for the player to be off the team. Sheesh Bro genuinely wtf is happening at Chelsea even as a rival fans it's getting hard to watch Pedro Neto will occasionally wear the No. 7 shirt when he is healthy this season. Meanwhile Mudryk is #10, he's a joke and so is Chelsea At this point I'm convinced we're on some reality show cause they're taking the piss Chelsea never bearing the allegations Since when did the Sky Sports gimp become Eghbali‚Äôs lap dog? His tweets about Chelsea in the last two days look copy & pasted. Wtf they're trying their best to force these lads out of the club It‚Äôs probably just for the money, but I can‚Äôt imagine any newcomers will feel any trust in Chelsea‚Äôs management with how they‚Äôve been treating their exits as of late. Horrific club Amazing that any player would go to Chelsea when they can see with their eyes just how players are treated. Yikes. But I have no love lost for the üêç It is so upsetting to see Chalobah and Sterling being treated like this. No ethics just money. Just seems a bit cruel really, horrible vibes at that club How will Chelsea stoop lower next time, that project is such a mockery of football. Hey Enzo Pal, I'm seeking clarity on my position at Chelsea You asked for clarity? This here's some clarity. Both players better be about to walk out the door to do this. And even then, just fucking wait. Classless move in my opinion.  We have done some dumb stuff over the last 2 years but this and the Gallagher saga are legitimately shameful. Sounds about right, would've been weird to see Neto wear a different number Whoever wears 42 will be the best player in the universe. I hate our current ownership This ain't no way to treat a player... Surely Chelsea can't get rid of all these guys. The board will have to be working 24/7 to get all these lads out the door. Neto gets no7. Raheem gets 50mil in wages Wonder if they even wanted those numbers or the club forced them. Wait. Didn't Neto already play in the first round?  Isn't that supposed to lock him into his number for the season? That's why United had to jump through some hoops to move the 7 from Cavani to Ronaldo wasn't it? Calling it now, if Neto stays fit he will be one of Chelseas main men. Can someone explain how him and Palmer fit in the same lineup though? So what will actually happen with Sterling. Leaving Chelsea or will be a rotating player? Idk why this feels like yankee santa situation How can Neto wear two different squad numbers in the same season for the same team? How long till Chelsea run out of numbers and start having to use triple digits? Watch out, if Neto gets injured or underperforms, there will be a new number 7 next year Is Sterling that bad? Surly someone in the bottom table of the PL would be interested? His contract must be shit huh? the great purge of the Maresca regime Sick fucks comedy club This should be good for team spirit Next Season Chelsea will start using Alpha Numeric characters on the back to accommodate the number of players they have Chelsea is such a shit show, I love it There's blood all over the floor but they haven't stopped slaughtering Jeez, I'm almost starting to feel bad for Sterling Taking shirt numbers off senior pros still at the club is as classless as its possible to be. Don‚Äôt tell me football is business and not sentiment. None of you are supporting your respective clubs because it makes sound business sense üòÜ Serves you right Sterling you rat prick. Neto is so overrated ‚ÄúEh, mate, it‚Äôs gonna be difficult here‚Ä¶ eh, and your numbers gone also‚Ä¶ ya?‚Äù ü§åüèª ‚ÄúIt had to be done, we ran out of numbers‚Äù  - The Chelsea Kit Man, probably Ruthless Jacking my number while im still here is always wild to me lol. Damn y‚Äôall can‚Äôt wait until I leave Chelsea have so many players they are running out of numbers It‚Äôs funny seeing r/soccer trying to find satisfaction debating about our shirt numbers. No other club gets so much focus over such trivial matters. Absolute privilege! Buy next year there will be no more academy players left to sell.. what happens then..? Welp, I guess that answers Sterling's clarity question on that press release Lmao literally Lmao, what a comment hahahaa ü§£ü§£ü§£ A banger for the ages Harvey Benny RIP Probably happening sooner rather then later Just saw someone wearing Palmer 10 in a concert Lunch was great, now onto dinner! There is no easy way now. It has to happen so get done with all the drama right away. Chelsea heritage And the comedy lovers How‚Äôs yall bp? You summed it up perfectly lmao It would be so funny if he is regaitered again, then is given a random number, comes on, scores, runs to the bench to celebrate, take off his shirt, revealing his original shirt with the 7 on it. Inception! Not allowed to wear #99 in PL But Mudryk is not part of the bomb squad we literally re-signed a player today Resign and resign are spelled the same. Feel for Sterling here, he's not done anything wrong to be treated like this The lad's Chelsea through and through as well, it's gotta suck super bad for him.   Like I feel bad that we sold Anderson, but at least we shipped him off to a team where he'll start and develop - Chalobah got straight up shadow realmed by his own club lol Id sit on my money, revise any and all offers, and sign a signing fee next year as a free agent. Fuck this. Kind of shit tho. He‚Äôs even worse than Axel Disaster Spoiler alert: it's going to be nothing I don't wish it on him but this is all set up for an early season injury to Neto. Next on ‚ÄúInside Chelsea‚Äù‚Ä¶ Updated squad numbers Squad registration is not yet closed, so yes, he can. Well, they just change the numbers on the shirts and update their spreadsheet and they're good to go. Have until Sept 1st. You missed the open goal of '7 is for the number of games he'll play'. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôll start regularly on that left wing. His only competition there is Mudryk. Nkunku and Felix will play through the middle most of the time. I think it must be a decision based on his performance in preseason. Maresca has said that Sterling isn‚Äôt his kind of winger - I was surprised, I was excited to watch him this season. I think there is still a quality player there who would benefit from playing in a strong system Maresca wanted to see for himself before he made a decision They‚Äôve made eleventy three signings since then, none of them fit to lace Sterling‚Äôs boots however The tinfoil hat theory is that it's come from above (the owners) since Felix signed. We had to sell Gallagher since we'd already budgeted for him being sold this summer and effectively spent as if we'd sold him. Which meant we had to buy Felix, not because we actually wanted Felix. This probably also means the club needs to save somewhere else, such as by trying to get the highest paid player off the books. Felix also gives Maresca a selection headache so a forward needs to go regardless.  Up to you whether you believe that. Maresca said Sterling's not the kind of winger he needs/wants. But he was saying how important Sterling was literally just a couple weeks ago. So very plausible he's been told by someone else that Sterling was for sale this summer and he's the face to break that to the media.  Idk what to believe in regards to Sterling. I think Chalobah and Gallagher were the club/owners. I think Chilwell and Petrovic are Maresca. I think Sterling and Carney could be either. Could simply be Maresca not rating them, having others above them in the pecking order and being blunt. Or could be the same as Chalobah and Gallagher where he's just the front man for the owners. But surely leopards won't eat my face? You underestimate the ability of people to think that they're special Human brain work mysteriously. People still travel alone to notorious place for single traveller despite news of bad thing happen to single traveller to said place. They think, I'm different, that might not happen to me. And also they probably get to be paid more at Chelsea than their old club Do you remember how volatile it was at times when Arteta took over and how many players left / had a falling out? Short memory, eh?   Look back at the history of CFC. It has always used a loan army for funds. Only recently has that changed to a far heavier outright buy and sell model due to changes in loan allowances. Iron sharpens iron and that has always been the way at CFC. Hell, even great players at Arsenal like Cole, Oli, and Fab associated more with CFC. The club has pull and players are hyper competitive. They want to be in an environment where they are challenged by other great players. CFC will have misses, but the ambition is there and clearly players see it because outside of Olise, very few players have balked at a move there, despite the wage bill reduction. It is almost certainly for $$$ As we should be Have you seen all the players who wore number 9 since Hasselbaink? It‚Äôs cursed.   - Aubameyang - Lukaku - Abraham - Higuain - Morata - Falcao - Torres - Di Santo  - Sidwell  - Bouhlarouz - Crespo - Kezman We should never have a player wear that number. Lukaku is still on their books! Since when do we include u-18 players in the squad? Jackson was pretty good last season It took us 5 years to finally clear out all of our deadwood, and we weren't struggling financially whilst trying to move them on That was the season where Chelsea couldn't decide whether to play Mendy or Kepa right? With Mendy being incredible until AFCON then falling off spectacularly I doubt we are looking for big value for them anyway.   Sterling salary will only be paid by Saudi. Chilwell will probably go out for cheap. We‚Äôll see. They‚Äôre damn good sellers, the best in the world, so we‚Äôll see. Want to make a bet on that? I am willing to wager that by the end of the window at least 10 additional players are loaned out or outright sold, with two of those being the largest earners at the club in Lukaku and Raz. I will also bet that CFC will lead the PL in sales and be roughly break even at the end of the window. On one hand I agree with you on principle, on the other hand Bryan Gil has held our number 11 hostage for years vilest* For wanting to get rid of a playing making 300k a week that has contributed very little? Sterling has been paid out the ass and given virtually nothing in return. I‚Äôm fine with him being exited.    Chalobah I agree. They aren‚Äôt players to Chelsea‚Äôs management, they are investments and statistics They‚Äôre either gonna rot in the sidelines until the next transfer window or each player is going for ¬£50m, no in betweens  And let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs gonna be the latter As the deadline comes close, clubs get desperate. Stranger things have happened. [deleted] I think the most used way will be Pedro right Palmer left. Though Pedro is better on the right. I also think we will see Pedro right, Palmer attacking mid, Nkunku left.   Maresca used a midfield 3 of Ndidi/Winks/Dewsberry Hall at Leicester with typically Justin inverting into midfield. Think that 3 at Chelsea will turn into Lavia/Caicedo/Palmer or Caicedo/Enzo/Palmer with KDH and Nkunku also able to play Palmers position. How is Neto on the Left since that's where he'll play 99% of his games. Almost üòè https://x.com/GrumpyN1ck/status/1826284537355317726   This you?  Or is this you just reposting other people's tweets as your own opinion on reddit again like you've got a huge history of doing? Damn, what did he ever do to you? I hate you It's actually quip of George Kaufman's:  >I was to leave on a Sunday, and Sonya gave a farewell party for me at her house the night before. Many people came, including George Kaufman, who was by then a screenwriter.  >In the morning, Mr. Selznick called me early. He said he had been talking to Miss Garbo; she was unhappy about several points in the film and insisted that I remain to fix them. He was sorry, but he could not let me go for at least another week. It was like being told after weeks in a hospital that you could leave on a certain day, and then, at the last minute, having the promise revoked.  >I met Selznick at the studio at nine on Monday morning. We were walking to the commissary for a cup of coffee. George Kaufman was walking in the opposite direction. He had said farewell to me on Saturday night. His face showed no surprise. ""Oh?"" he said. ""Forgotten but not gone.""  [source](http://snbehrman.com/library/newyorker/72.5.20.NY.htm) I don't get it You think anything will happen to Eghbali‚Äôs Ukrainian wonder kid? No chance. That was his first signing he had a significant say in. Than They're feeding us too quickly. They could have covered weeks of drama with this, slow drip rumours and uncertainty. Man u axes lunch and Chelsea provides it. Good guy Chelsea. Dessert should be yummy Why does it have to happen? Easy enough to just not use certain shirt numbers for a season, even if you manage to offload Sterling and Chalobah before the window closes.   If the club wants to apply an extra bit of pressure to get the players out of the door, that's their right, but it's not a ""Oh dear, sad but our hands are tied"" situation. Why does it have to happen? Why can‚Äôt Nero be given a different number? Yes it has to happen because you have, by your own manager‚Äôs admission, 15-20 players that have no place in the team: that‚Äôs absurd And my axe! False. My star wingback in my Leicester FM save made the legendary #99 his own.  I'll never forget you Adryaninho. why not?  pretty sure PL allows numbers from 1 to 99 freely That would be in La Liga, in the EPL you can wear any number between 1-99. You can wear any one- or two-digit number (other than ""0"") Why? That‚Äôs because he is the bomb. There‚Äôs probably a very inappropriate joke here somewhere >But Mudryk is not part of the bomb squad  Only because he's not a tight five player from South Africa. How long until you resign him? But there‚Äôs no way of differentiating them on text lol, hence the hyphen I dont know Pedro Neto, has he done anything to be treated like this? ‚ÄúMr President, another Sterling freekick has gone outside the stadium.‚Äù When he's on form he's fantastic, but fuck me for the ¬£325K he's on, he's way too inconsistent.  Club is doing the right thing albeit in a cut throat way.  Chalobah is just PSR fodder unfortunately - club have their transfer strategy and the academy players will fund it. Hard to do much wrong if you have done hardly anything for two years straight. You haven't had to watch him play week in week out Sterling defenders haven't watched him play for Chelsea enough, awful player. I mean he is on huge wages and only given 14 goals since 2022. He's being sold for poor performance. That's a totally normal thing to do.¬†   Gallagher and Chalobah on the other hand... > The lad's Chelsea through and through as well   Ah, so he has done something to deserve this after all pretty wild definitely. seems Sterling isn't doing that, though. feels too disrespected and just wants to leave. The problem is he is almost 30. All for nothing¬† If I saw that title out of context, I wouldn't know what kind of movie it was. TIL The comment was more about how he'll be injured half the time. Which is weird given that he's one of Pep's most used players and given that Maresca's possession ball is a similar system. Maybe Enzo just thinks he's past it and wanted to give a more diplomatic answer Ok that‚Äôs fair I actually like the Neto move tbf , felix I‚Äôm not so high on Wouldn't even say its tinfoil really. Sterling's wages do not work with the clubs new philosophy so it's more likely this has come from abover rather than Maresca not liking him. Especially when we have Mudryk/Madueke still. You know, this does make a lot of sense. The way everything unfolded with Sterling was quite rapid. You'd think if they (club/owners - not Maresca) wanted him gone they'd have worked at it since the start of the transfer window, not now when there's so little time. If they can't find a buyer for Sterling, for example, then that's him on the books till Jan at least, and regardless of how things go it means that he'll be paid the wages and give off the impression (justified IMO) to others that they don't care about you at all if you're not in their plans. It'd still happen even if he wasn't training with the first team. I'm thinking that that would put some off of signing for us.   And add to the fact that buying Felix instead of Omorodion made for  a selection issue since we already had multiple wingers, instead of getting a quality striker who we're lacking (even with Guiu)... Who did Arteta fall out with that wasn't justified? Ozil has had issues with multiple managers before and after Arteta. With Auba Arteta kept receipts of the times he was late, unprofessional as captain. Guendouzi has proven himself to be a cunt. I'm really struggling to think of more.   Arteta understood the culture at Arsenal was in the bin and he needed to have commitment from the players. Chelsea are outing players for financial reasons and although you claim players are joining for ambition, to me it looks like they are bringing in mercenaries who know they are now set for life with a move there. It's not a shock that the best signing was Palmer, the talented player who moved because he had a strong desire for playing time.  Maresca's first captain pick is a racist, Arteta's first was √òdegaard. Finding it hard to see how you can compare the two in any way really. Situations are not remotely similar to Arteta‚Äôs early time. Arsenal tremendously mismanaged player contract. plus there was negative environment at Arsenal when Emery left. But Arsenal since Arteta never once treated the best performing players like CFC has done with Gallaghar and Chalobah.   History lesson was unnecessary here in this conversation. Because the way CFC may not have any future. Running a huge football club like a business and treating players just like a commodity. I feel sorry for CFC players and fans ""Iron sharpens iron"" is pretty much the way at every top club in the world. It's hardly something that Chelsea are uniquely known for. The real answer is Chelsea is a big brand globally, they offer good wages and long contracts, and the idea that they treat their players poorly has been overblown. I don't really buy the idea that players are going there because they're ultra ambitious and they want to compete with other world class players in their position, that's just nonsense. I am not sure about it. What I am hearing in the media is the wages are just average without bonuses. And when you see players are treated as outcasts even if they were one of the best for the team like Gallaghar was why would any player want to go there. money and london club You should be ruthless for a reason.   No need to ‚Äúruthlessly‚Äù push out a perfectly capable rotational center back to replace him with another 40mil French error prone prospect ruthlessly stupid Hmm... soulless as well Hope your job treats you like that as well üòá Ruthless and brainless I'd say the curse started with Bouhlarouz. If you give number 9 to a CB it deserves to be cursed. Like 75% of those players were successful pretty much everywhere else they played What the fuck was Steve Sidwell doing with the no. 9 Please use a triggerwarning when writing Di Santo. I still have nightmares of his stint at Schalke04. Will admit I‚Äôm not a Chelsea watcher ‚Äî what was wrong with Abraham? Scored a bunch in the Lampard era then won a Champions League, right? Abraham was OK I thought? Not fantastic, but not too bad. TBF Drogba probably should've worn 9, but yeah that's a lot of misses. I think Pato might have had tye 9 for a minute too. Could have been 19 though, It feels like a lifetime ago. I assume you actually do have a #9 in your U-18s. They have strikers, they just don't have anyone wearing #9. Incorrect The spin the wheel for where N'Dombele would go on loan was great fun though While loans can help they aren‚Äôt always the greatest solution. More so just kicking the can down the road. You‚Äôre also down to maybe 1 or so even no foreign loan slots left. A new rule that might cause you all issues. Which is kind of my point. You might be able to move them but the fees/deals are going to be pretty uninspiring. No where near the Mount or even Costa examples commonly thrown around here.  On the second point, you‚Äôre already at the top of the window in sales. And you kind of have to be for the next 3-4 windows to stay PSR/FFP compliant as well. I‚Äôm really interested to see how well you all can keep that up. Also if you can do it while keeping the actual successes (like Palmer or Gusto) or if they are going to have to go just to keep things afloat. Pl teams can only loan out 6 non hg /u21 players per season. Idk there's a club in France that bought a rapist off united Why r u even.... The club is legitimising players to do this sort of behaviour when it's the other way around. Sterling had 18 assists for Chelsea last season 1 shy of Palmer and he was their third best goal scorer with 10 but go off  https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/article/2023-24-the-stats-of-chelseas-season PureProfit FC Anyone who overpays for a player from a club who‚Äôs manager flat out states they‚Äôre away from the team and not his problem, and who‚Äôs number gets snatched by the club needs to be fired immediately. I could have swore that he came on off the bench against City. Honestly, more than capable. I can‚Äôt help but root for him, hope he smashes it Boom. Roasted. From our academy and went on to sign for our most hated local rivals so we hate him. Yes, let the hate flow through you When people die it's often said ""Gone but not forgotten"" They've been replaced (forgotten) but are still at the club (not gone) Has he really been that bad everytime he‚Äôs played?  I have seen some moments of spark from him, which is more than can be said for a few others Mudryk is clubbed with. It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air to have a real convo about mudryk outside of the chelseafc sub You should read the article about the Man Utd lunch changes because they are doing no such thing.   The staff are now getting fresh food rather than pre-packaged lunchboxes and it is reducing food wastage. It‚Äôs okay. Rashford, MBE will cover the axed lunch Sterling could and probably should say fuuuck you I ain‚Äôt leaving.. he‚Äôs on mega money and has a contract.. disrespect is unreal And some leagues ban certain numbers, like I think 88 isn't allowed in Germany because it's a Nazi dogwhistle Oh my bad, apparently they changed it. Just read an article. For a short period, they banned first team registered players from wearing a kit number above a certain number You can't use negative numbers actually ü§ìü§ìü§ì ‚ÄúSomebody set us up the bomb.‚Äù He was at one point against you guys Malcom Marx and Ox paved the way for these cats to succeed today ""So new Chelsea manager Rassie you've went for a 7-1 split on the bench today with 7 goalkeepers and 1 winger"" They signed him, resigned him and now re-signed him. Full wash cycle for player completed.¬† At least a¬†season Only a matter of time His physio room frequent flier miles gave him a free physio room upgrade. Still can't believe he scored two great ones at the start of last season. Felt like a fever dream Good luck selling him the club should've seen him being inconsistent with us in his last years for us I think most agree sterling has not been great. But Chelsea is still in the wrong in how they're handling this. Very interested to see how they're going to offload players after treating them this badly. I thought it was due to his wages and/or not fitting Maresca‚Äôs much fabled system? > Chalobah   Don't think he had great performances for Chelsea, I'd say Sterling had just as many good games for Chelsea as Trev did. People just have more sympathy because Trev was at Chelsea for so long He‚Äôs 25 I think you‚Äôre confusing Sterling and Chalobah. This thread was about Chalobah. Even for Sterling; who cares. If he refuses to move unless chelsea compensate the loss of salary for him elsewhere for 100%, Chelsea will happily pay 150k a week for him to not be there instead of 325k for him to **checks notes** be banished. Sit on it for a year, and then pick a club you want to, instead of whomever offers the most money He‚Äôs also really honest about players, which I really like. He just basically said ‚ÄúSterling and Chilwell don‚Äôt work for me, they can go because our squad is too full‚Äù and now they‚Äôre both on the ‚Äúoffload squad‚Äù I agree. Tinfoil wasn‚Äôt the right word. More just that there‚Äôs no evidence for it so it‚Äôs what a lot of people are inferring/guessing from what we‚Äôve heard.  I do think people are taking it too far. They‚Äôre acting like every outgoing is on the owners. But I feel like it‚Äôs almost a guarantee that Chilwell and Petrovic being pushed out is on Maresca. It‚Äôs a bit of both between a fairly dogmatic manager being blunt about which players he plans to use, and owners that also tell him who they plan to sell and he just accepts that.  But yeah feel like Sterling is probably more owners just because Maresca seemed positive about like literally a week or two ago and things changed when it became clear we had to sign Felix. 1) The captain is Reece, he is injured so Enzo is filling in. Players had input into captaincy as well and Enzo is largely beloved by his teammates. Hence why there is 0 pushback and Fofana has even come out in praise of him.   2) CFC met with Sterling earlier this summer and had no plan to move him. This is purely a fit and Maresca's choice post preseason. Now the club is working with him to find a landing spot. Maresca has stressed that he has control over his squad and lineups.   3) 20 year old mercenaries? They just fielded the second youngest squad in PL opening day history. In what world does that scream of mercenaries? The club has been transparent of its desire to create a young squad with what it believes are the best young talents in the world so that they grow together.   4) Players were always going to move out since they are about 5 senior players heavy. Sterling being 1 of the 5 shouldn't be shocking given the additions of Neto and Felix, both of whom can play on the left side.      5) Players move on when managerial turnover happens. In Arsenal's case it was for a sour dressing room. In CFC's case it is due to squad size and tactical setup. Regardless, turnover should be assumed when a new manager joins.   6) The big miss that everyone continues to project in here. CFC has lowered its wage bill and the average player wages considerably. The players are on long-term deals for club leverage. The lower annual wages make it easier for the players to move around Europe in case a move is needed. This is good for all parties because it doesn't limit the player or the club and provides the maximum options. Players being kept away from training isn't anything new. This has been happening at every major club for the last 30 years in varying degrees. Did trying to exile Maguire or Sancho prevent United from signing Yoro?   CFC have been movers and shakers for the last 20 plus years and despite the massive number of transactions, very few players have ever spoken ill of the club. Universally every player that has been signed over the last two seasons has spoken highly of the pitch and the project and the understanding that the club is trying to create an extremely young but talented team that develops together. I would suggest that recognizing your misses and correcting them quickly is a trait that great organizations and companies have, rather than letting them fester.      What you see as a commodity move, a player might see as competition. The truth is, fans are projecting a far worse situation than the one that exists rather than the excitement and praise most of them have conveyed. If they were being treated like commodities ala how Barca handles exists, I would feel differently, but by all indications they have been pursuing preferable landing spots for exits. I hope they pay me 325k a week for being bad at itüòä Like Gallas wearing the 10 at Arsenal How the fuck was the 9 given to players like him and Steve Sidwell, it‚Äôs criminal Half were washed/dead at that time Mourinho gave it to him as he was unhappy with the signings that were made during that transfer window. Cause he‚Äôs brilliant üëç¬† still can‚Äôt believe how can some team trigger a release clause for him üòÇ Nothing particularly wrong with Abraham, but when he‚Äôs arguably the best of the lot then it still ain‚Äôt great. > Scored a bunch in the Lampard era  that he did. He was very good during the lockdown /Lamps first/Transfer ban season. And by that I mean he scored 15 goals. Our standards for strikers are in the sewer  > then won a Champions League  Didn't really have much to do with him tbf. He rode the bench from the moment Tuchel came in. Our front 3 was Havertz, Timo, Mount. And the first subs were Giroud and Pulisic. Tammy barely played.  He's just a purple patch player in the end. He looked great at Roma during his first season and now they cant wait to get rid of him. He had 11. True heir to Drogba. I guess Donnell McNeilly would count, he scored 27 goals last season Oh my bad lol Clubs end up with some quicks, City don't have a #1. Look at the reporting from Orny and others regarding salaries being the primary issue moving forward under the new fiscal rules. If Chelsea move Lukaku and Raz out, they will drop their wage bill by 30 million annually. Add in CL football and the significant impact that comes with that and it‚Äôs pretty easy to see how things get shored up.   Lower wages with higher bonuses allows these players to be moved far easier across Europe. Outside of Raz and Rome, the vast majority of the squad has gained or maintained value. The plan was always to front load purchases prior to the new financial system kicking in. I expect it to be far more measured moving forward. CFC still have 2 international spots left and a number of the players in question would qualify as home grown. A fair portion are also youth players that are going to go back down to the PL2 / developmental squad if they are not loaned out. Don't even have to go abroad, there's a club in London with a rapist in midfield He's a panderer. They already do.  Sterling has no future at the club. Why should they keep him around? Even more so, this isn‚Äôt a new thing.  Clubs do this all the time. He has 14 goals since he arrived. Wait, so Liverpool and QPR are rivals? He has good fitness and can run a lot. That's about it. The kid can't really play. They thought they could train him well enough to match his fitness but turns out they were quite naive. He has the occasional moment of spark purely from his athleticism, but he cant even do that for 90 minutes because when he came in it took him a long time to even get match fit. His footballing IQ is about what you would expect from a 23 year old that transferred to chelsea after half a season of playing in the ukrainian league. He has no clue where he is supposed to be on the pitch. He has talent only if you look at his athleticism and maybe his decent dribbling and occasional good pass but he quite literally still has to learn the basics he was supposed to have learned when he was an U18. Sterling has been a wildly underwhelming and frustrating player for us, but I'd still pick him ahead of Mudryk 7 days of the week and twice on Sundays. He never makes the right run, but he makes the wrong runs *really quickly*! He's 23 years old but has the playing time of a 19 year old.  There's a player there, but he needs an environment where he's playing every minute possible to get it figured out.  He won't get that at Chelsea, I'd recommend a loan but then Sterling wouldn't be frozen out. He‚Äôs like the new Ross Barkley. Talented but the footballing IQ is very questionable He‚Äôs got all the tools to be class he just hasn‚Äôt quite put it all together yet. If and when he does he‚Äôll be dangerous Not that bad as people make it out to be. Most of the time he‚Äôs the only one on the pitch who can get past players and create chances.  BUT he‚Äôs 50/50 to fuck up the shot/pass. He shows glimpses of really good stuff but so do I when I play with my mates. He‚Äôs really obviously in his head. There‚Äôs some mental barrier because technically and physically he has everything. I think he needs a stable environment and to play consistently. One of those players that doesn‚Äôt seem to respond well to the competition in his position and adapting to new systems. Mods, please ban this guy, he's clearly reading the  articles and providing facts, and we don't do that here. What if I told you we only go off headlines here and love to take the bait? I really hope he does. And I don't think the German NT would ever use the number 44 I think they previously didn't let you have number significantly higher than the others allocated. Why? Scored a singular goal that was unintentional So did Antony, what‚Äôs your point? And now their recruiting strategy makes sense! Felix is washed confirmed I‚Äôll give it a month For my expirience accompanying him, he will do a couple of good games, you will get excited only thinking is going to get better for him to get injured for like an half an year and then it turning into a cycle He will join Crystal palace within the next 2 weeks. You mean the club who at the time had no scouting team or director of football in place and was relying on Boebly/Egbhali and Tuchel for transfer decisions....   Only to sack Tuchel 6 games into the season.¬†   You forget how much of a shit show the club was at this stage. People can criticize the current strategy all they like but atleast the club are trying to follow a strategy and not just vibes¬† Wrong. Towards the end of last season Chalobah was arguably our best defender. Sterling has been consistently atrocious his entire time here. Round up when it suits your narrative Thats on me for having poor reading comprehension. I thought it was about Sterling. He's 25 until he becomes 30. That's how it works.  ^^No ^^wait ^^a ^^sec, ^^hang ^^on Correct I did.  I just left it up because me being an idiot should be transparent. I‚Äôd much rather that than having a coach who speaks in riddles   The only unfortunate part is that Sterling now has little time to find a new team There is no denying that CFC is one of the biggest clubs in the world and has world class facilities as well. Only a fool will say otherwise. But this doesn't matter in this case.   They might be trying to force players out to make the team better, but stripping players off their jersey number while they are still at the club just brings the reputation of the club a bit lower. And tho only reason he wanted to join you was because Mourinho took his number 13 at arsenal Classic Jose move, throw toys out of the pram in the most visible way possible¬† That is some world class passive aggression üòÇ maybe thats the trigger warning was for Ah yeah fair enough, just still seems a lot better than the other 9s listed I can see some of that. But also everyone reportedly has CL kickers so that added CL revenue will be at least partially offset by that. But if you do qualify that money would be a boost for sure.  Also the other flaw with the logic is that while the purchases are happening now, the FFP and PSR impact is being spread out. Shoot they changed the FFP rules because teams thought you were spreading out money too much. You‚Äôre going to have to offset the last 3 years worth of purchases for 5-6 more years. And only have 3 year rolling windows of sales to do so. Plus any new signing just adds to the pile. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll be interesting to watch develop. It‚Äôs fine now but can unravel fast.  I‚Äôd also argue the idea that most of the squad has maintained value. There are very few players in the squad that I feel would sell for the price you bought them for. That might change as they develop, which is why you‚Äôve targeted largely younger players, but that‚Äôs not guaranteed at all. it would be better if he was a panda Chelsea gave him a contract and offered to pay his 300k a week. Why the fuck is it the players fault if he wants to play and honor his contract? He's being frozen out and they're forcing his hand, yet people still take the side of the employer lol.   This situation is like your boss wanting to fire you but can't, instead he's kicking you out of your office and taking your work computer. No Chelsea I‚Äôll forever be curious wether Mudryk would‚Äôve been Artetas first spectacular bust, or actually make the steps that were needed for him to reach the top May be learn to be a fullback or something lol. He is strong and can run a lot and has good vision as well. Perfect for full back poition Sounds like Dan James for us without the wholesome vibes and our bizarrely good record in games where he started for us. Yeah how many minutes has he played? This is the big one. He's played about 5000 minutes at club level in his career, and like half of that came in Ukraine. Compare that to someone like Saka, who's 6 months younger and has played 17000 minutes all in England.  Feel like it doesn't really matter how much talent Mudryk has if he's not playing enough football. There's no way he's going to improve at the rate you need him to. His football IQ is just so far behind his feet it's crazy. The few times he has to go off instincts, he looks great. The second he has time to think, all technical ability seems to go out the window. That shit would get trained out of you in a top academy. But if you aren't lucky enough to train in one as a kid developing, you have to play catchup in your early 20s, which Mudryk hasn't.  He's 23 and looks like he needs a loan as if he's straight out the development squad. Or he just needs a manager to give him a season starting in the Prem regardless of how shit he is so he can actually adjust. But that will never happen because Chelsea have aspirations and Mudryk at LW all season is a surefire way to not qualify for Europe. Barkley is better. Sorry I don't know what came over me!  I accept my well deserved ban I believe in international play it‚Äôs 1-23 or 1-26 or how many players are allowed these days Wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem for Chelsea to be fair they‚Äôre probably running out of numbers Let me cope as a Chelsea fan and say it‚Äôs a worldie ü•≤ Hey hey hey, Antony is an icon though And who's gonna pay his wages Ben? Fucking aquaman ? Chalobah played well in dead rubber games true He is, the whole point is that the bar for that is in hell It is absolutely a unique strategy and it has its pitfalls, but I am always for a club going against the grain and trying to innovate in some form or fashion. CFC do not have the matchday revenue of their rivals due to the size of the Bridge. Buying and selling one way to make some of that up, so long as you believe in your front office and you have more hits than misses.   People are entrenched in tradition in football and anything that pushes on the norm is met with a ton of distrust and doubt. I can see what the club is aiming for and there is pathway to it being highly successful, IF the young and highly talented players hit. i agree wholeheartedly I mean contracts come with requirements.  They didn‚Äôt give him 300k a week to be mediocre at what he does.    Look I am all for the player.   If the club can‚Äôt find a buyer for him I 100% believe the club has to pay what the contract says.  He can sit on his butt and just collect the check.    I however don‚Äôt think a club should be forced to play a player because they have a contract. If my boss doesn‚Äôt trust I will do the job asked they are well within their right to freeze me out. He's still getting paid exorbitant ammounts of money I mean, it's not like he left you FOR Chelsea... We never know.... Think that title already belongs to Willian That Viera bloke isn't much good to be fair. Regardless, I doubt Arteta personally selected Mudryk. You can have a pretty good guess though. It's hard to make miracles happen. He would‚Äôve made steps   The signing was 18 months ago we are only through his second summer with the club   There would‚Äôve been a plan to get it to work unlike Chelsea where the plan is buy another player. His defending is pretty bad even for a winger, no positional awareness, don't think he'd ever make it as a fullback Then there is Lamine Yamal lmao Significantly Barkley was raw for a number of years but stuck around and refined to where he is now. ¬†Could be a similar trajectory for Mudryk, but I kind of doubt it. ¬†He‚Äôd be better at Southampton or mid table bundesliga. Chelsea to be the first club in history to collapse from an integer overflow you haven't bent over enough mate Probably Chelsea pay 200k of it or something for remainder of our contract. If you're a QPR lad and you go play for those cunts most of us won't like ya much anymore. I wouldn't expect a yank arsenal fan to understand how British football fans think mind. You guys don't get football rivalry like the rest of the world does. Well, there‚Äôs one way you *could* find out‚Ä¶ Unless he has supreme finishing, it‚Äôs generally a bad idea to buy an aging winger. After 31 they pretty much go the way of an old horse Vieira is pretty much theopposite of mudryk. He has good technical ability but no athleticism. Was more of an edu signing anyway I think, whereas apparently arteta pushed for mudryk. How are his crosses? Maybe a wingback? Course. But he‚Äôs trained in La Masia growing up. I did say that the minutes thing is most important to players that come from more obscure leagues/teams and they often have some ‚Äòcatching up‚Äô to do tactically. Whereas if you train at La Masia or any other top academy, you may be good enough straight out the academy at the top level.  But Yamal‚Äôs a freak. Insane that he‚Äôs doing what he is at 16. Sure, man. Rivalries are only a thing in the world of football I guess‚Ä¶ he understands but hes trying to win the argument Havertz2.0 Isn't Willian doing well at Fulham? Also only ¬£30m. I'd imagine we could recoup a decent bit of that too, he could still be very good in a less physical league I find it hard to believe Arteta has the time to watch much of the Ukrainian league between listening to motivational podcasts and reading modern man stoicism books, but I guess he is a football manager too. They aren‚Äôt lacking for distance, I can tell you that I wasn't even trying to argue with the dude, lol. Havertz at least made some positive contributions at  Chelsea and showed plenty of promise, enough so they basically broke even when selling him.  Mudryk every time I have seen him in a Chelsea shirt, has been pure dog shit. It hasn't stopped Chelsea fans the past year begging for him to play, but he's now had, what, 4-5 managers that haven't fancied him at all. There is no way Mudryk would recoup half of what he cost if he was up for sale. You know Havertz won a CL at Chelsea and scored the winning goal right? Haverz was obviously a top half prem level team player at worst without taking in to account potential, every top club wanted him not just Arsenal, it's just Arsenal wanted him most and laid more than anyone else would've been conformable. Mudryk was always a high potential high risk player that needed a lot of work I don't follow Fulham so I can't tell you how good Willian was for Fulham or how the fans perceived him.  But he isn't at Fulham anymore. >4-5 managers   He joined in January 2023, that can't be right can it? Potter, Poch, Lampard, Maresca. Fuck me it is > Havertz at least made some positive contributions at Chelsea  Only won them a Champions League Apart from that time he scored against us üò≠üò≠ > every time I have seen him in a Chelsea shirt   I mean Chelsea fans might be able to argue they have seen more of him than you. >But he isn't at Fulham anymore.  I don't know how I missed that. You forgot our best manager : Bruno Saltor. Bald and undefeated. That doesn't disqualify my point. I'm basing my opinion on having watched him several times, twice of which has been in person.   Are you disagreeing with my assessment? It doesn‚Äôt disqualify your point, but perhaps you are not the best authority on how good he is as a player given you have only seen him a handful of times. Mudryk can be quite good at link up play, can ping a cross, great speed, touch is improving, very effective when cutting in from the wing. I think he will be a strong bench option for us going forward. Remember he moved from Ukraine, his country is war torn, he had limited pro- minutes. Can‚Äôt write him off entirely just yet."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Great finish, but Arsenal is caught sleeping there. They left him so much time and free space Fkin worldie as soon as Neto went to RW. I was begging for him to attack that space that was some shocking defending from arsenal to allow some much space at that area fuck me he killed that ball He finally kicked the ball forward incredible assist from Enzo That's a good strike. Satisfying strike What a strike Great player The fuck are we doing giving him that much time He‚Äôs been so good, deserved! Really happy for Pedro Neto, he's been immense this season. What a hit son! Banger Absolute banger Get in there lads Now Arsenal fell asleep Damn Neto is kind of jacked. Never noticed before How do these get posted before they even happen on my TV? Lol Neto is a stud. Even Neto is shifting to the far right. / s Celebrating like it's Fifa, throwing out all the emotes This is what happens when he plays RW. Cooked Ben White all game at LW and could've done more if he was more confident. This man is a baller 10 times the player madueke is Havertz mannequin challenge What a hit son. Totally unexpected Why was Neto the deepest player at the start of that üò≠ THANK YOU KAI What a hit!!!!!! Arsenal sleeping What a hit son WHAT A HIT BOY What a finish LW - Sleep  RW - Fuck Great finish and run. Arsenal were asleep. What the fuck was Havertz doing üòÇ Golazo! oof golazo Fantastic finish but were did that huge gap in arsenal's midfield come from? STOP THE POLLS, CALL IT NOW!!!! Our best winger strikes ! Back in 3rd boys now let's bag another. warra strike Martenelli immediately hooked for not following neto Havertz... whats he doing there? Arsenal must feel very silly allowing them so much space for the shot Orgasmic! Gabriel proper shit out of it and turned his back. Important assist ü´° Where was partey and rice? Great goal. Wish he was in an Arsenal shirt this season. Man this goal hurt me beautiful Thricker! Simply Lovely. 25 MIN LEFT, NOW WE HAVE A GAME !!! AND NEVIL CAN'T SPEAK HAHAHAH LMAO Sexy Peter Drury just came what the fuck So lazy by Arsenal. If you keep giving them a mile of space they're eventually going to take it. Why is Partey in the middle of the central defenders? Banger great strike He had so much space to run into and no one even tried to close him down. Great strike though. Yeah don't close him down, that's good... Maybe Arsenal need to focus on how shit they are this season instead of worrying about when Liverpool will drop points ü§£ü§£ü§£¬† What a cracking goal! Once again we stop pressing aggressively and drop back into a low block of death once we take the lead.  I understand ""you're most vulnerable after scoring"" but only for a minute or, two. Neto is really IT. im jealous. I mean duh hes a right winger lol idk wtf maresca thinks he bought but its been so jarring watching him play on the left Poor defending yet again from us ffs this is some lit tomfoolery What a hit What a beauty. Why tf is Neville still on comms when his voice is sounding like that- surely they have someone that can step in instead that doesn‚Äôt t sound like he‚Äôs dying Banger of a finish. What were the defenders doing? Believe me I know all about defenders being statues. If Neto would‚Äôve been switched to RW, Chelsea may have snagged an additional goal or two. Timber already saw the danger from left back position while Saliba was walking. Saliba really constantly putting up stinker performances this season. I fucking hate football Started sitting off rather than pressing high like they had for the goal Im like bro WHY THE F NO ONE CLOSED HIM DOWN!!! If they only had a CDM covering the space Maybe the bandage on Kai is too tight I think Havertz lets him go because he is on a yellow, and the others think Havertz will close him down. I blame Havertz Madueke surely has had ample opportunity. It is time for Neto Keep him there at let my starboy start at LW He is a great player. Klopp wanted him with us a few years ago as Salah's backup IIRC. He always played really well against us too lol. I think we need to see a bit more of Madueke on the right, he did get that one hat trick in August after all Arsenal just opened a flood That goal is so fucking good Tf is partey doing there this cowardly nonsense is killing me the players got lost. Saliba had time to get back central, but if they agreed to keep him there then Timber needs to recognize his cover is in midfield once he sees that Gabriel is not shifted to Saliba's space .instead it's Partey AND Rice not agreeing on who's covering for Saliba, which is the real problem. Partey needs to shift up as a midfielder not a central defender. So i think Timber and Partey screwed up their rotation Fooled them 20 times The Gusto sitter chance doesnt happen kicking it forward does it? The constant turning back is definitely from instruction. When Neto was with us, every time he was up against his fullback, you knew he'd give it his best shot to take them on and make something happen. I thought he was your best attacker all game by far. Had the beating of Ben White quite a few times. 4th this week I know this is a joke but he‚Äôs actually played a great pass there, lead him into the space he needed to attack Right up there with Busquets on Messi‚Äôs el Classico goal Similar to Messi vs Man U in 2011¬† Brother satisfying is an understatement, I ejaculated. FR He‚Äôs been such a great addition to the team. You got a goal!¬†   So it's low block time üëçüèª Saliba out of position, Rice and Partey on the defensive line, no one is listening to Gabriel screaming to fill the space. do you wish for a draw, it doenst it even matter to you ? Gabriel screaming is me rn You have a delayed TV or stream, this happened one minute before really, 40 seconds probably  Go to betting sites they are almost right on time Facts. I see it go in and there's already 2/3 posts about this My streaming service is two minutes behind the action at all times, but at least it is very expensive and an absolute pain in the ass to use.  So it evens out I think. Often I pull up the stream on my computer and compare it to the TV and it's not a small amount ahead. My TV is always about a half minute behind and I'm not sure why Are you watching on IPTV service like youtubetv or something? OTA is like 30 sec ahead. Broadcasters were wasting time just like Arsenal squad They live in the future For the nailbiting matches I always have this tab open refreshing every 30 seconds so I can avoid heart attacks .. I got to see it before here on my TV (Romania) I swear once it was posted before i seen it live on studium It was a corner, then Chelsea recycled possession. If you watch closely, you can see Colwill and Fofana at the edge of the box. We were defending a corner and then got all mixed up. Saliba went on to the byline to press the ball and Partey + Rice both dropped in to cover it when obviously it should only be one of them. As far as I can tell, Noni is not useful on the left at all, whereas Neto is. To play them both Neto ends up out left, but if Sancho was available we might see Noni start on the bench and Pedro get RW starts with Neto in the seemingly better form of the two. Actually not that difficult to understand at all me in 5m when its our turn to fall asleep again You mean you can still go forward when you‚Äôre winning? No idea why Arteta has instructed this, again.  Completely cover up when they go ahead artetenyahu loves to do that and it gets punished way too often So fucking sick of it man Every single time. It‚Äôs ridiculous. It is quite often on Arteta's menu del dia that was a rice/partey space. kai is where he's supposed to be I don't get this.  It was a right to central movement so the defender on the left should have tracked the runner.  Havertz was defending the ball.  Havertz wasn't really playing with any intensity or intention, but still, it wasn't his man. Nah, this is on Partey staying in the back line instead of filling that space. I blame Arteta. Arsenal always play like cowards once they get a goal.¬† It's time for Neto RW on a consistent basis. This was ridiculous for numerous games now. We need Sancho back first unless Misha is given the opportunity Madueke should continue to get opportunities at times though, he's been amazing sometimes but it's just the inconsistency of youth I think. There's a really great player in Madueke being made and he's almost done incubating in my opinion. but Madueke scored a hatrick against wolves ""Partey, no!""  -Me when I see Partey Was still looking for Palmer to track down. And Rice? And more importantly why was it taking so long for Saliba to return to his position? Watched a few times over and I completely agree seeing salibas full face on that side line camera pretty much predicts everything that follows Great first goal 3rd in the table. I think this one was more important than the last 3 combined lol The memories :( I have absolutely no recollection of this. Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen We def miss him at Wolves but I‚Äôm happy he‚Äôs been doing well, he deserved a chance to play for a top side. Arterrorist Don‚Äôt get me started man A draw would very much be the preferred result. Of course it matters to us, Arsenal are the 3rd best team in the league that we‚Äôre top of. I've always wondered how betting sites have a better live score service than live score sites. Guess they've got more people on payroll than free ones. You probably paused. Fast forward? What's the point of watching a game then? That just kills all the excitement of the sport. Ahh that makes sense No, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs against the rules. Been taking note from Southgate Spurs always continue to attack all the time and they are made fun of by everyone We did the same against you guys at Anfield when we went two up. Huge mental block for him, it is a losers mentality. He should take a note out of Klopps book and go for the kill relentlessly.¬†     Bit of shame in a way because Arteta was a part of the Wenger squads where we got walloped regularly by the top 5. But when given the chance as a manager against these sides he opts to defend a lead like a relegation side.¬† I honestly feel all the early season red cards rattled him and he's overcorrecting. No idea why this narrative is on here again, average positions after we scored were still way up and even our LB Timber went on a winding dribble to get a shot on goal. Loser mentality look at the difference now they have started pressing high again Tony Pulis is Arteta Father You can't let them pick a pass like that when you're deep in your own half. Force them one way or another, press, or cover the run. Can't just stand there ball watching. Both Rice and Rice dropped to cover for Saliba who pressed himself out of position. Poor communication from them two imo, left him with acres of space where the DM should be Even in that space what can he do these days but be beaten. Has been a cone for months but he does 2-3 passes forward and the fanbase thinks he's the best player we've got. I'd bet we're winning this game with Merino starting He was covering for saliba who was out of position, you know fuck all about football it's not on Arteta to organize the D after the corner routine. the players get lost. Saliba stays in Timber's spot, Timber stays in Gabriel's spot, and both Partey and Rice cover for Saliba (only Rice is correct).  They needed to figure that out when the ball went back to Neto around the center circle Yup. No denying that. His assistants need to be better and make him realise this hasnt been helping us.¬† Chelsea does not have enough LW options until Mudryk comes good. There's also going to be Estevao next year Palmer should be back on the right, he doesn't have nearly as much impact in the 10 spot Depends how the manager feels about Misha How nailed do you think he is either way? Got my eye in him for FPL lol I'm just happy he's getting a run without injury so far tbh. He's an absolute joy to have in your team, runs after every ball like his life depends on it for the full 90 Why do people keep on saying that? Can anyone help me with a ELI5? Why did I fall for this hair thing every time man Despite their form, they‚Äôre realistically the 2nd best team based off the last 2 seasons They're pretty close, probably difference in mere seconds  Betting sites like 365 are huge and there's so much money involved literally billions so obviously they spend money to get as close to real time updates as they can There‚Äôs a middle ground between what Spurs do and what Arteta does with a goal advantage. Instead of approaching this with a reactionary take like all the pundits we moan about, how about we look at this play objectively?   This clip won‚Äôt show it, but for some reason, Saliba runs way out of position to try and help Timber close down Jackson. The ball goes out and Partey drops in the back line to cover for Saliba‚Äôs absence. It‚Äôs why we had a massive gap in midfield.   Comes down to Saliba‚Äôs reckless decision-making and over-aggression, not because we were trying to ‚Äúsit in‚Äù due to Arteta‚Äôs mentality.  Also, this didn‚Äôt come from a day of rewatching or analysis. Literally the moment Saliba ran out of position I was already tense, and when I noticed he wasn‚Äôt hustling to get back into position every alarm bell was going off and Neto capitalized with a great finish. Hes got that mid table coach mentality man Kai's not ball watching, his man is the one with the ball. the problem is that there's no midfielder covering the space behind kai. in this play, partey gets lost thinking he's covering saliba's space. but Rice already has saliba's role (saliba is in timber's left back spot). Partney needed to step out sooner and recognize he's not covering for saliba, he needs to cover for Rice. he just needs to be in it, being beaten is not what neto did to get that shot off I‚Äôm not one to judge from the outside but it seems like Arteta has a good amount of ‚Äúyes men‚Äù around him and it scares me Bro. Mudryk has been improving ever so slightly. It was worth starting him as LW to allow Neto as RW.   Madueke has been in the lineup for so so long just based on his hat trick vs Wolves. Sancho should start once he returns. Felix or Nkunku out of position is another option We literally have like 5 different players that can play there Who has surprisingly done quite well this season. I know it‚Äôs usually lesser teams in cups and conference but he looks miles better this season and is one of our top assisters and should have had many more assists Mudryk in good form in cup games and Sancho showing flashes amidst being poor. Enough to consider this though I agree mostly Sancho Can sancho play on the left when he returns? He was great before injury. Neto on the left and Estevao on the right next season fixes that. Fan of Noni, but he's just not getting it done effectively against the top teams. Sancho, Felix and nkunku can all play there at a level above mudryk can. Maresca explicitly stated that he believes we have 2 LW and 2 RW. With Neto and Madueke being RW and Sancho and Mudryk being LW.    So, whether or not Estevao is coming, he believes Neto is a RW player.     Honestly, he should need absolutely no convincing to drop Madueke but he's been the teacher's pet since Maresca arrived. He clearly has an affinity for him and is giving him special treatment because he hopes he's going to be credited with making him I'd rather have Mudryk at left wing than Madueke stinking up the place on the right But Sancho exists? . . . . Right? It‚Äôs so weird this opinion is always downvoted. I think people just don‚Äôt watch games or definitely don‚Äôt understand football. He is so consistent on the RW, best player every game last season there even if he didn‚Äôt score or assist  Central he is either a 10/10 with 4g/a or 5/10 ghost, so I guess that‚Äôs why the stat merchants think he is better central Arteta + Terrorist I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Arteta he‚Äôs still waving forward, Rice just always drops because he gets nervous, he‚Äôs not brave enough, which forces everyone else to drop or leave a massive hole in the middle of the pitch like this Can tell he spent the majority of his career playing under Moyes Tbf to Arsenal they did this so well almost all game... It's not what he did for Neto to get that shot off but that's exactly what he did to void any chances of us winning the ball back if the first line of pressure led to Chelsea passing to the middle. They could just turn and run before getting a foul or starting an attack.   We will never win the title with Partey in a starting XI. I cannot say the same with any other player who started.  If the whole midfield is fit and he starts vs Forest, while Im usually ultra optimistic, I say the title's gone. He is also decent defensively. I think that's mostly why Maresca prefers him Mudryk has done well against opposition that's far below us. To throw him in from the start against Arsenal would likely put him back at square one, killing the confidence he's just started to build up. Mudryk's improvement has only been evident against MUCH easier competition I‚Äôd be willing to try Mudryk, or even Jackson there with Nkunku up top. It‚Äôs not ideal, but Noni needs to sit a few matches and get right. Or bring on Felix/Nkunku and put Palmer RW. Just something. I dont think Nkunku does well on the wings tbh so it would have to be Felix How long is he out for ? He has played every match for us at LW position so yeah he is our LW alongside Mudryk and neto too when needed. Great is an overstatement. He's been okay Been ill. He‚Äôs the starting LW when he‚Äôs fit. Yeah not sure, I'm surprised more people aren't noticing his drop in impact this season. And it's especially funny because people Poch was criticized whenever Palmer was playing in the 10, but it's all good now because Maresca is doing it.  It's so much easier to mark him out in the 10 and we've seen like 3 or 4 games back to back where Palmer hasn't had much impact. Even for the stat merchants, he has 12 G/A this season and 8 of them came in 2 games. He can farm the weaker teams in the 10 role but the bigger games like today are much harder > best player every game last season there  He still played on the inside consistently then. Partey has been one of our best players this season Neto is also good defensively. He sprints back and forth so much. I'm astounded with how much he runs. Yep he‚Äôs much better defensively than Mudryk who is honestly quite lazy when it comes to tracking back I get that. What I'm saying, is that it's worth slowly including him in our PL lineup. So that Neto goes to the RW position where he's so dangerous. Madueke hasn‚Äôt done well against anyone since wolves There are a lot of possibilities with this squad. I would like to see more of Jackson on the left and Nkunku up top. Not necessarily all the time, but Nkunku is our best offensive player that is not regularly playing and Jackson as a winger that attacks the box off the ball I could see working well. At least as long as Nkunku regains confidence which seems to have wavered a bit lately. He is Ill supposedly so it shouldn't be long 3 matches, 3 assists, and a pen won. Just say you don‚Äôt watch the games. Nobody in their right mind wants Palmer playing the role the wingers have in this team. Yes but you are marked different as a winger and there is inherently more space out wide compared to central. Perhaps he was the one of the best players in a depleted squad desperately in need of any creative spark, where quick progression through the lines solves the issue of not being able to beat an established low block.  Note, that depleted squad was on course to struggle to get top 4, and on course to get out of the CL at the first real hurdle.  With √òdegaard back, is there such a need for quick progression? When it often enough leads to lost balls? When Merino, Rice and cie can recreate part of it, while being safer? We for sure are now able to beat low blocks, and while mid blocks are still an issue, fast runners and long balls are the way we should try to solve them in upcoming transfer windows. Where does that leave Partey? On the bench, and out of London, come next season. He was one of our best players without √òdegaard, he's now the worst starter with him.   For the little he brought that let us compete without creativity, hes still the same ticking time bomb taking a spot in the squad that could be dedicated to an actual player who's not finished physically, who can produce up front, and/or who can defend transitions. Hes none of these 3.  I wont cry if we bring him off the bench again should √òdegaard be missing, but for the meantime, he just makes our job harder, we already can't score loads recently, sacrificing our ultra solid defense for so few progressive passes is a net negative. I'm not saying he's not, that's why he starts on the LW  I'm saying the other LWs don't track back as much hence why Neto and Madueke start Totally agree. Just not with Arsenal to begin with in my opinion. That's a bit much to ask. I'd rather ease him in against smaller teams and let him get some more confidence going. He hasn't been great but Mudryk has been absolutely dire pretty much every time he's been given a real chance. Madueke has also improved his defensive contribution by a lot, which is something Maresca wants. His goal was literally the only reason we got a point against Forest. Idk I like Nkunku up front but idk about jackson on the wings he seems a better striker for me Apparently he took a knock in training while he was ill aswell. You are also marked differently when there are two nr. 10s and Palmer still drifts into wide spaces. Partey is one of the best players in the league at receiving the ball in our own half and turning then driving forward or playing a forward pass. He also played well at right back when needed this season.   He doesn‚Äôt take excessive risk but you need someone to play it forward otherwise we will never leave our own defensive third.   All the comments on the Arsenal player of the month post for October were saying Partey should have won it when it was given to Saka. Mudryk tracked back quite a bit in the time he was on the pitch. No harm in giving him a chance. Just not true at all And his selfishness was the reason we didn't win it. Dont be surprised if he doesnt suit up vs Forest. Hoping Mikel thinks the same I do. Progression is nice but if you think theres no way to reach our front three without him then we might as well forfeit the title: after all, Partey will never be available for the whole season. We cant beat low blocks with him as easily because we know we play -1 on the transitions. We cant beat midblocks with him either. He offers us so little. Hes the best solution we got at times because we lacked a good player to play next to Rice and √òdegaard, thats all he is. It absolutely is. What part of it isn't true? Madueke put in a shift defensively but the hate train for him is already in full flow even though Neto was equally shit for large parts of the match as well Seems to be a common thought but it doesn't hold up to much scrutiny; he created 0.43xA in that game, that's half a goal's worth of assist."

Anthony & Onana ü§° What the fuck is Onana doing Anthonyyyyy üòÇ I just feel like it's so fucking obvious hahaha Shambolic goalkeeping Onana terrible as well All starts from Antony losing the ball, terrible decision making Now that's funny. You just knew it was coming Why do you have so much space when you're trying to hold on to a lead?????? My stream is several minutes behind üòÇ You don‚Äôt let them counter attack from a corner like that in injury time LMAO What a game I‚Äôve never seen a keeper never move less than Onana lol Shocking game management from Ten Hag and Antony. AIN'T NO WAYüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Onono antony is motivation for kids everywhere that they too can become profession footballers, no matter how bad they are Fucking knew that a draw was coming after the penalty decision, ~~don't think those 5 minutes will matter now~~  Okay no, Mainoo you beauty United are hilarious lmao NETOOOOOOO Beautiful goal This game is bonkers the carry job is still so on How have united let themselves been countered on like that in the 95th minute Antony giving the ball away cheaply led to 2 goals Hit them with the mbappe finish Size? Massive mate. Shocker Of course. Neto you beauty. Most undeserved draw I've seen for a long time but get in! EtH making some the dumbest subs ive seen how the hell have united managed to draw this. ANOTHER 2 goal lead squandered So glad I decided not to turn this off at 2-0 and 3-1 LOL I just love this United THIS IS THE END OF TEN HAG  ERAS DO COME TO AN END!!!! [deleted] Nice one Antony LOL We‚Äôre defo losing this¬† How Man united? hahaha Shitting on Anthony is always acceptable but let‚Äôs not ignore the fact that Obama literally didn‚Äôt move for this shot. Absolutely shambolic goalkeeping Antony killed us off there LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL It is the history of United ayoooo ...LOL Utd are fucking idiots. Last minutes, goal up, why the fuck are you sending your CB's up for a corner? Brain-dead It's in our DNA lol __BOTTLEJOB UNITED__ of course He is him i actually don't feel surprise anymore Absolutely unbelievable game. so entertaining That's tragic oh my god lmao What the fuck happened No way No fucking way Lol Banggggg Wow....Man Utd games are entertaining Just tuned in and seeing Neto score an equalizer is amazing lol Madness from man utd having that many players up on a corner that late in a game they‚Äôre leading You gotta be kidding me.¬† Totally deserved Lol Antony really worth the investment. THE GOATTT Come on man‚Ä¶ Lololol 95th min up 3-2 and we have half our team up for a corner and just hoof jt in the box instead of taking it short? Wow....Man Utd games are entertaining Such a deserved result. :) United DNA Of course Antony lost the ball üòÇüòÇüòÇ All because of the bullshit penalty.  Fucking rubbish. Antony is such a mug You knew it was coming, Man U and blown leads; name a better duo. Everyone saw this coming post those changes Comedy club lmao Neto Neto Great finish though 80 million for antony. ten hag masterclass love life The sad thing is they could score again Neto just gained a signature move. How do you get counter attacked 3 -2 up, away from home, on a corner? Gave Onana the eyes there lol Conceding a counter after leading away in extra time.   Just United. Was always coming after they got the pen for that dive Onana offers nothing to us. FFS I hate Antony and I hate these useless refs Serious credit to Wolves and Gary O‚ÄôNeil, a proper ‚Äòwill not die‚Äô attitude 80 million bucks Getting counter attacked at the 90 minute when winning... Why ?? classic Onana Main takeaway from this is that Man Utd has a worse defence than West Brom Brazil v2 Onana is just watching, Antony losing the ball like that, so many players up there in the final moments of the game protecting a lead. Antony isn't even worth 25 million let alone 85, garbage player through and through Antony was playing for a foul. But he was predictable and ovious in his intent, with neither the chop or statue to sell it. Is ohana just good for standing on the spot and not even trying to save the ball? It's ridiculous how many times he has done it. I‚Äôve never seen a goalkeeper hide from the ball the way Onana does. One thing is sure Altay wouldn't have conceded that goal that pretty sure Is Antony pound for pound the biggest waste of money by any organisation period? Onana really had that far post covered lmao Mainoo FTW Antony needs to understand he's no messi Ref was wolves mvp Onana‚Äôs positioning is fucking horrendous Man U are playing that Brazil move vs Croatia Why is Onana still on goal instead Altay? give that lad a chance man ffs Mirror: https://streamin.one/v/0f204d1c Antony t3n-h3g Ten hag saw Ange-ball and thought ""I'll have some of that"" Honest to god where the fuck is the right back or someone to fill that space?! The space like Surely keep it in the corner there?? You knew it was going to go bad the moment you saw Maguire and Evans up in the box, what the hell is Ten Hag doing? Ha ha ha, that was great. Antony has got to be the biggest waste of money we've had in the last decade. And that is honestly some achievement considering the amounts we've absolutely wasted. Horrible decision making. Shoots when there is no chance he scores I dont even care about his price. He is just so bad. Its absurd. Like what Generational terrible transfer Better United attackers in the U18 surely, he's so fucking shite.  Just runs like a headless chicken half the time. He is so fucking shit Antony should never give up possession so easily, but why are United even pressuring so hard for a goal in the 94th minute when they're ahead by one goal away from home? There's like 9 or maybe even 10 United players on Wolves' half when Anthony lost possession, makes no sense considering the state of the game. Wolves had so much space on the counter, you'd think that United were the ones desperately chasing a goal [deleted] WHile i agree that he's partly to blame, Shaw didn't do him many favors there. all those ‚Äúantony is the greatest‚Äù chants got to his head Any charity would been 100x better than that guy Luke sends the slowest pass to a player in the middle of two players closing him out and he has zero viable options. How are you going to blame him fully? 100m you know I never want to see Onana again either He made every worst possible decision everytime he got the ball. You paying what you did for Antony needs to be ridiculed forever, like how Chigrinskiy to Barcelona or Woodgate to Real Madrid are in Spain. Pretty weird for a manager to play a bad player over someone refusing to say sorry for you lols üòÜ  That's the Ajax way I guess Why bring on extra defenders and still get caught up on counters? Shouldn't have sent CBs in the box for corners when you have a lead to protect for 5 minutes Seeing Antony play literally ruins my day. He acts like he‚Äôs doing so much on the pitch but does nothing. It‚Äôs like, he just twitches around when he has the ball and then does the wrong fucking thing. Every. Goddamn. Time. Why on earth wouldn‚Äôt you just cross it in there ffs !!! Reminds me of Manchester United in Copenhagen and Istanbul! Found who's to blame. Why thank you fellow gunner for showing support to us /s Get fucked Eat shit Ask and you shall receive bellend Hate Antony all you want, but why were so many people forward defending a lead in the 94th minute? Total fucking bottle job Most of Ten Hag‚Äôs signings have been shit or average at best, with the exception of Lisandro Martinez. Think he's catching a lot of unnecessary strays here. He's unsighted and it goes right in the near post. [Maybe his positioning could have been better?](https://imgur.com/a/3IpWpgX) He cheated to the far post and got caught. Just like the Champions League! dude everyone swearing at the entire team, people forget that stupid goal keeper tho seriously what do u wait for? to be dropped in the championship? onana and that stupid bold guy need to go On the wrong menu Maybe not LMFAOOO Another shocker from him. And to think I was so hyped when we signed him. Nah that's not on him. Through the legs finish with that much power is curtains. Varane has to get closer but that's a 10/10 finish, and is gonna get lost because of the goal on the other end. Neto is mad. I'm so sure I watched Altay enough He wouldn't have conceded that goal that's pretty sure Takes a deflection doesn't it You're being too rough on him. He was expecting the far post because Varane was covering the near post. A shot through Varane's legs was very unlikely to be successful so Onana was banking on that assumption. It was a high skill shot from the striker imo. I mean, Scotty scored... Nothing, thats the problem. He has the reaction time of a mars rover. Guessing. If that was bobbled he'd have a chance but that ball is struck clean, through the defender's legs. Best finish of the game even with the goal on the other end. Completely intentional, perfect execution. All the wide players need binning Hold it bud Ten Hangover emmm [removed] Sorry what? Same ü§´ Funny SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I mean with how it ended yeah. Nah what mainoo just did is our history.   Benfica are a tiny club btw nvm ü§® Has to be both goals came directly from antony losing the ball in a simple fashion   his first touch is so poor, not in the technique but in the direction he chooses‚Ä¶ which is nearly always straight into a player Well yeah that didn‚Äôt help obviously, but they shouldn‚Äôt have that many men forward in the first place. Reminds me that last goal from Lucas Moura >!ü§¢!< against us in the UCL semi-final (also under Ten Hag), just so naive t3n h4g not now 7 Hag. Reads like a virus name. No. That would require planning. None of that nonsense at United. You're welcome Ten Hag has a serious serious problem with identifying talent. And yet he wants to have a say on future transfers. Only behind Hazard to Madrid imo That's a more competitive league than any other in the world, honestly.   I mean I might think back a bit longer than a decade here, but there's been a ton of hugely expensive flops ever since Ferguson left, it'd be genuinely hard (and interesting to me) to rank them. You were giving Alexis Sanchez ¬£400k a week, and that wasn't as much of a waste of money. You have Antony we have Mudryk. At least Antony looks like he knows how to play football however shit he might be. Mudryk is not a footballer. I believe this bum is just an addition to the martinez transfer Biggest waste of money by any club ever imo, only player that comes close is Coutinho but he wasn‚Äôt this bad Best return if you‚Äôre going by fidget spins per 90 mins. Mudryk says hello Ten Hag ball You expect everything to be handed on a silver platter? My man had more than time to pass but fumbled around and got tackled. He does this all the goddamn time and it sticks out Let‚Äôs get him, lads! In fairness he said 4-3 and not 3-4. Probably to win the ball back as quickly as possible. Only bad ones have been Onana and Antony. Mount has been injured so the jury is still out. What do you mean ""unsighted""? In your image he has clear visibility of the ball and Neto's movement. He reminds me sooo much of Kepa in all the worst ways. They concede ‚Äúunsaveable shots‚Äù like this where they don‚Äôt even move, look so tiny in the net, and have zero commanding presence we know it since the beginning, people complaining about De Gea leg, so we bring Onana that we already knew that he come with good leg but obviously can't beat De Gea as ball stopper.      Then we play Onana like what De Gea did, stay on the line, so yea we fck up. you're welcome not entirely his fault but his poitioning is a 0/10. Shot was not even close to the post and he is still a long way from getting it Altay ""the one shot, one concede"" Bayƒ±ndƒ±r would definetly conceded. He's got the reaction time of my grandma. My grandma's dead. üò∂ Well Mainoo clearly took offence to your comment and decided to rectify the ""best goL"" yes, but still the reaction by Onana was sub par. Hold what..? United getting the win doesn't change the fact that this was utterly naive from the manager and team from the corner. ü§´ Bottling at both ends ffs. Haha comment did age like milk for sure! Indeed sir, you‚Äôve proven me wrong, the mighty Manchester United are now placed 7th instead of 8th. They're still in Europe and will actually qualify for next season unlike yous Exactly this. He chooses ""towards goal"" Everytime but he doe not have the ability to look up and he never scans around him before receiving the ball. Is positioning and situational awareness is pretty much non existent. He knows how to run the line and cut in 18 yards before the corner flag and that's it. I think if we had legs he wouldn't have even got on the pitch. üòÇüòÇüòÇ tbf it works a lot better wild He was good for you tho Kunt Honestly rather have Hazard injured all the time and only providing vibes to the team while Vini got minutes than Antony wasting valuable playing time being terrible Hazard is not even in the same universe of bad transfer as Antony... Madrid paid that money for a world class player who succumbed to injuries keeping him off the pitch but still showed some decent flashes at the beginning and was an unproblematic guy. United bought a mediocre at best Eredivisie player who's been a complete liability for them and who also happens to be a massive piece of shit Hazard to Madrid is a mare, but didn't hamstring Madrid from success. Antony is crap, but United were never a better RW away from going finishing 3rd with 2 cup finals in his one full season.  The one that truly takes the cake is Lukaku. Came in for 100 million to the CL holders, fell out with the fans within months, now they are making pennies in loan fees for him while still lacking any sort of goalscorer after spending billions. Ferguson also had his share of flops as well  Veron  Forlan  Djemba Djemba  Kleberson  Bebe (!) It's amazing that Lisandro cost 2/3rds what Antony did, considering how good he is and how shit Antony is. DegenPress The shot comes through the defender.¬† This one's only unsaveable because he decided to stand several metres away from his near post Exactly, cannot believe that anyone thinks this is anything other than awful. He's way too far from his near post and compounds that error by having all of his weight on his right side. He guessed, and got it wrong. His positioning is fine, relatively central and with a priority covering the far post but still capable of going down to his left. If that shot is bobbling towards him, he's fine. It's the execution that kills him. That's why the finish is so good.   Imo it's the type of finish the best players choose. You see Mbappe do it all the time and every time he executes it GK is stranded. It's almost like a diver or a gymnast choosing the highest tariff option, just backing themselves to execute to guarantee a win. Was made after the goal, Mainoo's finish contextually is amazing and with the meg Mainoo's is the better goal, but Neto's in a similar situation tbh. Changes the game state, wins his team a point 999/1000 times, and executes what's basically a certain goal because he gives no indication he's going near post.   Will get completely lost because they lose the game but wow. This thread is full of people saying ‚Äòhah what now‚Äô when it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that was really poor from United to even allow a 3rd goal was fun while it lasted  entertaining match lol I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how he‚Äôs made it this far in professional football Exactly. He is fine for lower leagues. Getting 80m for him was straight up robbery Preach. Hazard had excuses. Anthony genuinely seems to try and he's awful. Yep lukaku is the right answer here, don‚Äôt forget that he spent the whole summer saying that he was coming home to prove a point. Prick Oh yeah didn't mean that he didn't - just specified the time frame using his departure as the flops REALLT started being the norm since.   Partly bad recruitment, partly managerial instability or inability, partly just things not working out - but it's been a nightmare for them since, and quite hilarious for the rest of us Yeah and of those...  > Veron  Very good in Europe, played for 2 seasons and only took a ¬£10m loss on him shipping him off to Chelsea  > Forlan  Cost about ¬£7m, still scored 17 goals in 2.5 seaosns, including winners in some big games.  >Djemba-Djemba  Was utter shite but only cost ¬£3.5m, and United recovered half of that selling him to Villa  >Kleberson and Bebe  Both equally bad, but again only a ¬£12m combined fee.  This mega-expensive flop thing is 100% a recent thing for United. Ferguson liked to sign a lot of players with potential for smaller fees (remember there were many players like Tosic, Obertan, Bellion, Djordic as well as Hernandez, Solskjaer, Park) knowing that many wouldn't be at the level needed, but those that worked out would be massive value for money. how can you still say it wasn't onanas fault it's totally beyond me your logic... omg  that guy isn't even jumping on his feet! why do keepers do this? cause to react quickly! Watch some good keepers they always move foots if you stay like this you never save a single shot unless it hits you!!!!!! i cant believe theres ppl like you around here, in a good way Fuck knows who's gonna take him off us..... Bro we already bought him, you don‚Äôt have to keep selling he is nothing like Ribery That‚Äôs true but wouldn‚Äôt you be more frustrated with a Talented player getting injured or  crap player being crap He scored too many goals to be the right answer he had a goal every three games it‚Äôs 100% on the management. Ownership made it a commercial corporation vs a football club, and it shows.  The United academy is what has kept the team afloat through some of those times. Rashford, Garnacho, Mainoo, McTominay, Greenwood, Lingard, Welbeck, Evans. etc etc we‚Äôre a bit jaded nowadays but back then a $12M was sizable   $30M was the going rate for near world class players in a position Keepers are supposed to prioritize the open part of the goal. In this case, his positioning was quite right. Varane was covering the near post and through the leg shots are just part of the game. Most of the time you see strikers go for the far post and that's where the keepers anticipate the shot. I think the only fair criticism is that he wasn't on his toes to shift weight quicker. He's flat-footed because his weight is getting ready to take him the other way, which is what basically every keeper will do, because the overwhelming majority of the time a player is going to bend that ball round the defender. It's the far easier thing to try.   If a player does go near post, you'll have time to adjust your weight and go *if* the ball isn't hit clean, which is likely given a near post finish is much harder in this situation to hit cleanly. Most players going near post scuff it because it is caught in their feet or they don't have the balance to pivot of their standing foot or whatever the case.   If they go near post and they hit it clean, that's them executing imo the hardest option. The keeper has let that be the one he has the least chance of saving, because of that fact (which is how lots of defending in general in football works). So yeah he looks a bit silly being a statue, but it's because Neto executes. Injuries generally aren‚Äôt a player‚Äôs fault. I can‚Äôt blame them for missing out if they‚Äôre not fit to play, no matter how important or overpaid they are. Hazard tried to get back into the side, from what I understand, but his body gave up and he was never disciplined like a Cristiano type.    Anthony is so clearly not United material it hurts. He‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not good enough. That‚Äôs frustrating to me because there‚Äôs no chance he reaches the level needed at United, whereas everyone knew Hazard was world-class when healthy. This was not a well-struck shot. He gambled way too hard to the far post with his positioning and anticipation, and gave up a goal on what should have been a routine save."
"Chelsea confirm the signing of Pedro Neto","2024-08-11T14:51:04+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1epml8l/chelsea_confirm_the_signing_of_pedro_neto/","[No textual content]","579","TrenAt14","https://www.chelseafc.com/en/video/pedro-neto-is-a-blue","The first three games before he tears his hamstring will be amazing Great move for Neto and feel he‚Äôll do well at chelsea but like; why?  Palmer is undoubtedly starting RW/Right half space, no ones moving him. Neto/mudryk/sterling cant be the striker.  So if sterling isnt moved on youre just having 3 players on pretty high wages for long years on the left?  Definitely jealous of the spending but surely even chelsea fans arent like THAT excited about this? Am I just blinded with bias? There are so many 'if's in this Chelsea squad, but IF they can keep Neto fit, him and Palmer on the wings, Nkunku in the middle in front of Caicedo, Lavia (IF he can stay fit) and Enzo/KDH...that's a pretty fucking good team.   Hilariously think they still need a striker though, if they get Osimhen that's an absolutely ridiculous team. I wish Juve had a half or a quarter of Chelsea's spending power... our targets would have been wrapped up already. Oh, I know this guy at least. Unlike their 10+ other transfers made this window. Can he already sub in for Mudryk for 2nd half of Inter friendly? Neto on 2nd of August.   ""I love this club, I‚Äôm really happy to be here and take this team to another level""  https://x.com/NathanJudah/status/1819486193463202123  Very very sad to see him go. Can't believe he's actually left Wolves, he seemed like one of those who probably wouldn't get a ""big"" move for a variety of reasons incl. injuries for him specifically. In this situation a 7 year deal makes sense as it gives him a better chance of being fully fit for at least one season. That is a fantastic signing. Would've loved Neto. Why would you announce a player *during* a game? The guy has less Premier League goals than Harry Maguire, but could help creatively How many players does Chelsea have ? Apparently that takes their net spend to around ¬£69M Another one Opened the link and got surprised that I had to watch commercials twice for a 20 seconds announcement video‚Ä¶  Is it really necessary for a club like Chelsea ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Correct me if I'm wrong but is he going to play LW? I thought he's more of an inverted RW, but Palmer is nailed there I wonder who we will sign tomorrow.. chelsea as an institution needs to be nuked Great move for CFCMD This feels like when you first played Championship/Football Manager as a kid and just sign players because they're available, rather than actually improving your squad. 7 years to an injury prone player is definitely a choice. Great signing, but how is Chelsea able to buy and buy and buy and continue buying without breaching FFP rules? I mean, last year the fees they were paying were eye-watering already. They aren't even in the Champions League this year, and are just following the same trend now? Chelsea need to be investigated wtf is ffp 8th signing for Chelsea, they make the rules up Come on, this must be some kind of money laundering agreement. He‚Äôs signed for 6 years.  He‚Äôs not that impressive and is injury prone. How many players have they bought this window lol feels like every other day they buy someone It's a very Chelsea signing; a really good player, in a position where they already have some depth. He definitely improves the team but it's not a scary one. It's weird how they'll bet the farm on a player like Mudryk developing in the long term and then sign another player in his position (I assume Neto moves to the left wing, or is Palmer moving more central?) Who? Have never heard of him. Maybe because he plays 10 games max a season. Another one to hang out with James and Chilwell.. Maybe him and Reece can put their good hamstrings together and share Sterling is rumoured to be going. Neto plays his best football at LW so he won't be competing with Palmer Our left wing is dead have you watched sterling and Mudryk this is needed badly especially in this system We absolutely needed an upgrade over sterling and mudryk It‚Äôs inevitable Cole will start playing a more central role. We were in desperate need of an elite winger, and Neto will likely be our 1st choice on both wings, he‚Äôs a slots in perfectly imo. Sterling will be gone, whether it‚Äôs this year or next remainins to be seen. But it‚Äôs better to have his replacement sorted a year early than late. Palmer wants to be 10 > Palmer is undoubtedly starting RW/Right half space, no ones moving him. Neto/mudryk/sterling cant be the striker. >  > So if sterling isnt moved on youre just having 3 players on pretty high wages for long years on the left?  a.) Maresca likes his wingers to play wide‚Äîthe 2 half-space roles in his system are the #10 and one of the double pivot. I think it's likely he plans on starting Cole as the #10  b.) Mudryk has not impressed in preseason and Chelsea might sell Sterling Nobody is on high wages except for Sterling Assuming a deep run in the conference league, we‚Äôve got something like 60 games this season. That‚Äôs enough to give Neto, Sterling, and Mudryk enough game time to show why they deserve to be starting.  My guess would be if Mudryk finds form this year, we‚Äôll look to move Sterling on next summer and if he doesn‚Äôt, Mudryk will get loaned somewhere and we‚Äôll see how he develops. If Neto can stay healthy he walks into the starting XI on the left wing. It's definitely an upgrade to both Mudryk and Sterling TBH, most Chelsea fans I know, including myself, would just love a transfer ban at this point haha Have you seen City‚Äôs depth? The only way to compete is to be overflowing with good players because injuries will just ruin the season if you‚Äôre not well stocked And if Colwill and Fofana can stay fit and build a partnership I genuinely believe this team will surprise a lot of people. I'd rather not sign Osimhen. High wages big fee italian striker (deja vu...). + we already have 3 great talents in striker position (Jackson, Guiu, Samu) Likewise so you guys could take Sterling off our books Careful what you wish for lol And yet you lost out on tobido to west ham ü§£ you want him to get injured already? Come off it with that. He‚Äôs always been loyal and shunned talks of transfers in the past, never thrown his toys out or anything like that. The club had a great offer and he accepted it his end. Doesn‚Äôt mean he wasn‚Äôt looking forward to playing this season for us Any idea who will replace him? Will wolves look to buy someone or is there ready replacement in your team? He's taking you to the next level by getting you ¬£65m Classic. Shades of that Fabian Delph interview at Villa. A week later he signs for City I wonder why players talk like this when they know they're about to move. i always play FM game with Wolves because Jota, then Neves, then Neto.. i am cursed. You‚Äôre going to open up an opportunity for a whole load of comedians with that comment > he seemed like one of those who probably wouldn't get a ""big"" move  Look, you know what we have to do now, don't you? Playing in the conference league play offs is a big move? it's not like he left for City bud. not sure we're even considered a big move these days.  unless you're strictly referring to wages then i would agree He's a very good player but it's hard to spin this as anything but a huge risk.   The guy has missed at least 20 games a season for the last three seasons. One of those was a serious knee injury so may be avoidable, but his tendency to suffer hamstring issues should be of concern. I think he's a good player and would also love to have him, but I'd be concerned if we spent that much money on him given his injury record Would have loved him at United if he stayed fit but it's very risky i mean, statistically with as many players as we sign it was destined to happen eventually It‚Äôs only a friendly like.  We announced Cenk Tosun at HT while losing to Liverpool in an FA Cup game. they brought him out and announced on the pitch at half time Brought him out at half time. Don't see an issue with it tbh. He does? LMAO  Always rated ‚Äòarry Net spend doesn‚Äôt matter How do you think they are funding these transfers smh Neto can play both sides. He played inverted because that‚Äôs our system. But under Nuno and Lage he played more on the LW. Maresca plays kind of with a 3223, box midfield. So Palmer will probably be a part of the box, essentially the 10/odegaard role They‚Äôre not even in the Europa League, we evicted them and took their spot üòà Does Reece have a good hamstring? Sterling will go nowhere. Id seen that but I cant imagine a lot lining up for hik in the current state even though I definitely still rate him whos paying his wages? Going...to be signing one of those eight year contracts 0 chance.  Sterling is *levels* above Mudryk and the only time Maresca's tactics have looked good is when Sterling is on the pitch to *make* it look good. No one is going to match his wages (I guess he won't accept less). Only United are stupid enough to cough up. Thats what I said, the only place he will be playing is LW where they have 2 people This issue with pushing Palmer central is that you force Nkunku out of his best position. I think we‚Äôll see Palmer out wide if Nkunku is on and Palmer will go central with Madeueke (or possibly Neto) out left if Nkunku isn‚Äôt on the pitch I dont think its inevitable palmer plays centrally, why mess with the only part of chelsea thats currently succeeding. Neto is very good but not elite and injuries have to be a concern. Theres no official talk of sterling being gone and and a replacement isnt exactly essential when sterlings still 29 Would be an 8 in Maresca systems since he doesn‚Äôt play with a 10 but ya I imagine he‚Äôll plenty of RW and 8 Being on 80k a week for 8 years is the same as being 200k+ a week for 3 years. Sure you could fancy it up with inflation and amortisation but they are on high wages Yeah, (but not slabbering here) city have a world class or near world class player in every position and back it up with top players in each of those positions, apart from palmer and MAYBE enzo/caicedo/james someday, I dont see any chelsea players in either of those categories First of all - Chelsea is playing conference league, not champions league - that will bring down intensity of the season by itself.   Sure you want depth but there is also sometimes having too much players. City, at least in last few seasons, never really had that many players - they had stacked starting XI and then 6-7 very versatile players that can fill in at multiple spots. Imo that is better way to build depth than just stockpiling players, granted it is hard to find players like Bernardo Silva who can do the job at AMF, both wings or as an 8 Yeah but Colwill is pure profit.  They'll likely sell him next season to fund three 18-21 year olds for ¬£20m each with mid-table potential. Osimhen is in a Luis Fabiano arc. I think he's going to be continually linked for seasons and never actually move, probably for the better. Considering our situation, I am not against that move. No sarcasm. The main problem is that we're too broke to pay for his salary. So unless Chelsea subsidize about 66% of his salary, we're not getting him. my point exactly Yep, it's always been an understanding that players like Neto would leave if we received a high enough offer. Unlike some players he never threw his toys out of the pram to force a move. We've got Sarabia and Hwang who can and have played that position in the past. Even if Hwang has done it in a somewhat out if position place.  We've also had Rodrigo Gomes this summer who would likely be a replacement. That's not including some of the u23 squad members we had to rely on towards the end of last season. Gary just said today that we‚Äôre looking to add to the wide forwards now. So I imagine someone will come in, tbd on if it‚Äôs a proven prem player or youth. But it has to be someone with pace, aggression, and work rate to work in our system. We also play our wingers as inside forwards. So it‚Äôll likely be a left footed, RW.   For the left side we already have Gomes, Hwang, Cunha, Bellegarde, and Chiquinho that can play there. Possibly even Podence if we can‚Äôt move him on. For now Rodrigo Gomes. But we want to reinvest some of the money... apparently Forbs/Borges from Ajax is on the list. The Korean guy? How have you managed to raise the price already? ¬£51.4m with ¬£2.6m add-ons. [deleted] I absolutely know 100%, but he's slowly been injured less past two seasons. Still bad, but less haha.   And yeah, it's a big if with the injury free thing, but IF he can be injury free, god I'll be jealous.   He's fantastic. His workload at Arsenal would have been vastly less rigorous than what is required of him at either Wolves or Chelsea though.   I think those worries could have been mitigated by playing behind Saka and getting minutes here and there on the left when needed. The second he's fit for the other two, he's probably starting, he's getting overextended, and careening right back into reinjury. we've done it several times before Can't imagine which was worse. Exactly. Doesn‚Äôt FFP apply to them? I am really curious about this Maybe he could borrow one from his sister? [deleted] [deleted] That‚Äôs the biggest issue. I‚Äôm sure there are loads of teams that would love to have him. But I doubt he wants to take a pay cut and none of those other teams would be willing to match his current salary We have been looking to bring a starting LW all window. Unfortunately, Mudryk and Sterling are generally just massive black holes on the left.   Sterling especially is such a weird and frustrating player. He has some G/A but is so frustrating to watch. Going into another season with only them as our options will set us up for more mediocrity. The idea is to offload Sterling this season, but idk if it will happen. Palmer played better centrally last year Couldn't disagree more with just about every word of this comment so we'll just agree to disagree > sterlings still 29  Almost did not believe this, but I guess he started v young. > Would be an 8 in Maresca systems since he doesn‚Äôt play with a 10   His base setup for most of preseason has been a 4-2-3-1; Nkunku has often played as a 10 that goes into a half-space role in possession  Cole could easily play that role in this system IMO Except it's taken you 5 years less to earn the same amount. It‚Äôs not remotely the same thing definitely not. Thats not how it works at all lol Caicedo is there, he‚Äôs untouchable in the team. So is Gusto.  Edit: fair enough on the downvotes but I‚Äôm pretty confident any Chelsea fan will agree with me here. Regardless, depth is essential to compete now ü•±ü•±ü•±  Seriously can we not even have one discussion without the same unoriginal, recycled, overmemed replies?  Chelsea currently sell academy products and buy South American kids. Maybe it will be a disaster, maybe it will work out, who knows? But congrats for noticing, very astute. it's crazy to me you guys are broke with your owners. I'm not saying you aren't broke but don't the agnellis own fiat?  Or is it an ffp thing? He's as much of a professional as our boy Ruben, still love them both Because who has time to keep up with all of our transfer bollocks? Just guess a number and eventually I'll be right. ""I'm not thinking about the future, I'm just focused on my commitment to the club"" - see, easy, without leading anyone on That's the thing we agree he's great. I do wonder now I think on it, what role his style of play does with this cos he's a relentless ball carrier and foul magnet. The idea that Chelsea have no choice but to start him every game when fit and can't possibly manage his minutes with their clown car squad is kind of ridiculous. Possibly. I'd argue his ceiling - injuries aside - is to be starting for a top six side.   That's why I say he's a very good player. Nothing about his ability is in question here. I went and looked back at when he suffered the hamstring injury and it was about 10 games into the season - a period during which he wasn't playing the full 90 of every game.   We could dive into the weeds of sprints, distance covered, etc to see if that's the problem, but all I'll say is, I hope Chelsea have a plan similar to the one you outlined with reduced load. His injuries are not work load related though. Idk why all big club fans think a reduced workload solves all injury issues. Neto just has unlucky genetics. His injuries come at random, whenever they feel like arriving. He‚Äôs had a variety of them in his legs. Sometimes he goes 20 games healthy, sometimes 1. I think with his clinical nature too, he could even get in over Martinelli at times if he's not on it.   Alas, not to be.   Hoping Chelsea's defence continue to be shaky haha. But imagine if they went unannounced completely. It‚Äôs the 68th minute. At old trafford. Night game. Man United trail Arsenal by 1-0. The ball goes out. The lights turn off. Pitch black. The 4th officials board goes up. Rashford departs but why is the 4th official holding a number 19. Man United don‚Äôt have one. A spotlight hits the tunnel. *Here comes the money! Money money money* ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Messi! It‚Äôs Messi! By gawd! 3rd? No way he's behind Mudryk. ambitious? he‚Äôs on 200/300k a week, no one‚Äôs taking that off Chelsea, he‚Äôll just chill on the bench Doubt it, part of him moving to Chelsea was so he could be back in London wasn‚Äôt it. lol who else would pay 350k a week? [deleted] It‚Äôs funny from the outside looking in. People are quick to call Chelsea shit, but some are still shocked when they go to improve a key position just because there are already warm bodies there. I made 3 points, one is an opinion that neither of us truly know. One is an opinion that im fairly certain most people agree with (neto isnt elite yet) and one is a fact (Sterling is not close to leaving) Feels like in 10 years he might still be starting somewhere. Yup exactly, there's no true 10 in possession but Cole is perfect for the half space role Clearly talking about the club spending money on you drowning in water is same as drinking 2 liters of water everyday Depth absolutely is, but the concept of depth is that the player backing up is a sufficient level that you dont miss the primary player that much, if all three are similar level and none of those are the top 4/ title contender level you presumably are looking for then you just have 2 players wasted Sorry.  Do you want us to go back to when we took the piss out of the fans for being plastic?  Or when they were getting constant stick for being racists? Is it a meme reply? It's absolutely possible, even likely, that Chelsea looks to cash in on players like Colwill over the next year or so. It's relevant considering you named him as someone who could start in a potentially great team. Nobody in Italy is fine with paying this kind of salary. Only Vlahoviƒá broke that amount allegedly, so that's the amount that's apparently reserved for players expected to rule the league, and at this point, Sterling is not.   Osimhen, Lautaro, Calhanoglu, Bremer, Morata - their salary is much lower than Sterling's.   It's very different in England. Osimhen is the 2nd highest earner in Serie A, in England he would be like 25th. After the last 5-6 year Exor put a stop to the excessive spending It‚Äôs an ffp thing, the owners could easily afford to outpay every non state-owned/Saudi team. Just look at Hamilton getting a 100 M a year, but ffp and bad financial decisions in the past has fucked them [deleted] Tbf I really have no idea what their outlook has become after this summer so I'm not saying it to discount their other wingers, just don't know who's still in the plans, who's stayed who's left, and Neto barring injuries feels very plug and play.   Moreso my point was that Arsenal would probably have had more breathing room to be cautious with his game time and managing his fitness Thanks for clarifying. Probably suggestive of why we didn't go forward from our interest a couple seasons ago. It's foregone speculation anyhow.   And it doesn't seem like wolves fans are shedding too many tears over him leaving no. Good player, but good business and with less of a headache? > I think with his clinical nature too, he could even get in over Martinelli at times if he's not on it.  He is not clinical at all, his one wonder goal not withstanding Football transfers would be a lot more fun if they debuted WWE style alright Mudryk‚Äôs instagram is the only reason why he‚Äôs still receiving any goodwill from fans [deleted] He‚Äôs on ¬£325k per week haha and I‚Äôd imagine we work out some sort of situation where we cover a portion of the wages or pay him out the difference if he accepts a permanent move to a club that won‚Äôt match his wages. I think this deffo occurs with loans. Maybe that's an option for him ‚Ç¨126m of warm bodies there already It's a tough situation for them. Their current options aren't good enough, but they also are on high wages and Mudryk at least is too young to really give up on, so bringing in someone else causes some bloat in the squad. People are quick to criticize us for everything we do, simply because we're Chelsea.   Which is fine. Nothing new, there's just tangible reasons to criticize us right now so people latch on to them like their life depends on it. That still doesn't make sense.  Sterling transfers and wants the same or better salary - the new club will pay him 80k+. If Sterling were on 200k, the new club would have to pay him 200k+.  I straight up don't know understand how you consider 80k for 8 years the same as 200k for 3 years. It's different no matter how you look at it. I‚Äôm not disputing that. They‚Äôre clearly buying a lot of potential and not a lot of baked in players, but they‚Äôre obviously going for depth given how many signings there has been. Maybe you could try adding to the actual discussion or at least having an original thought for once? If he starts and becomes an integral part of a great team he doesn't get sold. It's better than talking about how you love the club and want to take them to the next level a week before leaving Yeah I think Wolves fans aren‚Äôt freaking out because we‚Äôve seen a lot of fun players perform, leave, and ultimately get replaced with a new young star. Jota, Neves, Traore, etc. I believe he is, decisive in his passing and when to shoot. Not enough goals last couple seasons, but how he plays, he sure as hell is decisive for me  Martinelli is a mixed bag right now.  Whenever I've watched him at least.   Neto would start for all teams (maybe barring City and us depending on who's in form)  He's not just a wonder goal merchant. He would receive my goodwill if he did one simple thing during games - raise his head up from time to time when he has the ball. You're joking. Mudryk needs to go on loan. Absolutely fucking not. The only thing Mudryk is good for, is leaving on a loan somewhere. He has 3 more years on his contract. You‚Äôd be looking at a lot of money, I don‚Äôt think that happens for another 2 seasons if that.   Think he‚Äôs unmoveable at the moment tbh. on over half a mil. wage every week of warm bodies     Saudi, please, I beg you, come save us! It's definitely different, but the contract length does matter.   Right now Mudryk doesn't even look like an 80k per week player, but he knows he's guaranteed that for 7 more years. Even if another club was willing to pay him that, they'd probably only offer him 4 or 5 years max. He'd have to be willing to give up a guaranteed 8-12m to move, which he may not want to do. Fine...  You're right! Finishing 13th will be a big suprise to a lot of people. Gallagher started last season and was one of Chelsea's best players. He got sold. Mount started and was player of the season two years in a row. He got sold.  Chelsea will be starting every season tens of millions in the red. Unless their revenue takes a dramatic upwards turn, players who can turn a large profit will be sold to offset that. I don't know how you define ""clinical"", but he's just poor in front of goal [deleted] Yeah. Even if another club for some reason offers him 150k, the payout is going to add another 20m to the books Well done mate, nice try. Originality is still a bit lacking but you're getting there. I thought it was funny mate Gallagher started because he was always fit, not because he's a great player in a great team.   Mount fell off so hard in his third season, it's still kinda crazy to me but I doubt you'll find more than a handful of Chelsea fans who think he was too good to be sold.  It's academy players now but each coming summer the youngsters were buying now get easier to flip for an accounting profit. We haven't sold an academy player that's integral to our team and I don't see it happening with Colwill. Definitely wrong word on my part, decisive is more what i mean. In passing and timing of passes and shots.   At least for me. He‚Äôs on ¬£17m py, ¬£100k pw would be ¬£5m py so ¬£12m saved.  That‚Äôs ¬£36m in wages, which you often have to give as a lump sum.   I also don‚Äôt see clubs lining up to actually pay a transfer fee for him.  He‚Äôs a good player, I would say what‚Äôs more likely to happen is a straight loan where you cover part of the wages, but Mudryk is the one who could do with the loan tbh. Narrator: he was not getting there He‚Äôs annoyed about something and letting in crawl beneath his skin. Just leave it lol Gallagher started because he was the only midfielder actually performing for a long time and the manager liked him.   Mount had a tough time with injuries in his third season. If there were only a handful of fans who didn't want him sold, that says more about the Chelsea fanbase than anything else.  The two academy players you've sold have been more integral to the team than Colwill, considering he couldn't even get a game for Chelsea as last season went on. If Lavia and Nkunku weren't injured all season, Gallagher doesn't start. Instead we had a defensive player playing attacking midfield for over half the season. Admittedly he was very good playing further back with Caicedo when Enzo got injured but he's fourth choice for that role when everyone I'd fit.  Mount I meant in hindsight, we didn't want him to be sold but it definitely wasn't a mistake now looking back on it.  The Colwill situation is hypothetical, if he's great he stays. Last year he was played at left back and then had two bad injuries but he should nail down a starting berth at LCB this season. Maybe, or maybe they struggle for form and he starts anyway. Lavia was only 19 and Nkunku was never competing for the same position. Again, the manager liked him so no reason to think it's an impossibility.  I'm not saying it's inevitable that Colwill gets sold. I just disagree with you saying the other guy was giving a ""meme response"" by suggesting he'd be sold. If I was to think of players in that squad who could feasibly be sold, he'd be right up there. You're entitled to your opinion but saying Gallagher and Nkunku were never competing for the same position tells me you either watched none of Chelsea's pre season last year or don't remember the role Nkunku was playing before injury and kind of kills your argument.  I'd bet my house that barring injury or a disastrous season, Colwill is not one of the next 15 players sold by Chelsea."

I can‚Äôt believe this is part of an official club article lol Lmfao So it won't be awkward sharing the same physio room Sometimes the memes just write themselfs Why would Chelsea themselves share this info? Asking to be made fun of. No wonder he was hugging Reece for a long time in the tunnel, they're hamstring brothers This is a trolling statement, right? Right? *Mazraoui has been added to the group chat*  *de Ligt has been added to the group chat* ""Their eyes met across a crowded physiotherapy room"" if you‚Äôre able to see footballers as human beings this is actually a nice sentiment imo, recovery can be brutal especially if it‚Äôs your livelihood and how you spend the majority of your time.¬†  nice to think Reece has someone else (amongst the many injury prone at the club) to connect with Really hope he does well at Chelsea They'll have an insane amount of time together this season lying on the physio tables.

Under 10-15 right? Does he refer to himself in the third person? esicko brothers If they sign Dembulance too...what a combination Lucky for them now they can share recovery ideas in person! Christ. They're both so great ,keeping the injuries aside... This could be good for Chelsea and Neto if he's able to grow and perform Like on a serious note, within clubs it happens a lot.  I think for Liverpool, Joe gomez and Ings got close when both were out. Recently thiago and stefan Bajcetic. Jack Wilshere admin of the group ‚ÄúHow long you in for?‚Äù  ‚ÄúAh only a couple of weeks. Wasn‚Äôt as bad as we thought.‚Äù  *Paul has been removed from the chat* The best part about it is that it's not even a quote from Neto that they had to include because it was part of a wider quote. He doesn't actually say this in the interview, they provide the background (and the banter material) for him. ‚ÄúWe met in the recovery ward post-op and we knew it was meant to be‚Äù Damnit to hell I was too slow on the joke. Take my up vote. Why, were they not aware he's been injured before?  It's not like he just announced he tore his ACL and will be out for 2 years It‚Äôs üÖ±Ô∏èoehly‚Äôs kink Man's gonna hit copyright strikes on ppl making memes and jokes about this As in they are sharing one between them? Too bad, they didn't meet Jones as he already graduated. As do I he is a great player when fit I'm laughing through the tears. Brewster and Ox were really close the year both sat out the whole season in the physio room, like a big bro/little bro relationship the preseason after. Keita broke this index finger while clicking the 'join group' button Tierney and Bellerin for us were recovery bros #FBU Abou Diaby VP He‚Äôs handed it off to Tomiyasu Phil Jones created the group I was about to call clickbait and then i realise this is the club posting this...They really just outjerked themselves >It's not like he just announced he tore his ACL and will be out for 2 years  That will surely come soon For 4 legs Does this make a sterling departure more likely? Our whole team might have gelled last season then Can we give him back? I will always remember that video of the Barca fan calling out the players names as they drove by in their cars. Man started yelling Dembele when an ambulance drove through hahah Child me was certain he was gonna be one of the best players in the world. I learnt a valuable lesson that you need to not be made of crisps if you want to be a footballer ‚ÄúThey really just out jerked themselves‚Äù   Please grow up Sounds like it but the wages will be a ginormous stumbling block.

Martinez really replaced Leao with Neto this game just for him to do the exact same thing - even diving and getting a yellow lol def dragged his foot there Actual good decision Great refereeing Well on his way down before contact. Good refereeing. There‚Äôs contact but he clearly searches for it. I have no problem with that being called as a dive. Haha stops his leg and stretches it out towards the defender while already falling over.  Genuinely pathetic stuff. Keen on that. Classic leg left in, well played ref.¬† Other decisions have been questionable but i respect this one from the ref not folding to the pressure. Love that he aint taking shit from nobody Neto diving like he‚Äôs in scuba gear Clear dive great call. truly a worthy backup for Leao What is it with Portugal and diving i always thought this was the Italian way Brilliant refereeing I completely missed that Correct. Good refereeing. Imagine your country being booked for diving in all 3 group matches haha. Surely has to be the first time this has ever happened? Im ashamed for him Portugal love their diving wingers TF is up with their LWs diving ffs Love the ref. Wouldn't mind VAR being used to give out yellows for stuff like this in addition to the usual. I wish more refs carded dives like that, minimal contact doesn‚Äôt mean flop to the floor Ref is having none of it. Good call! I've been whining (screaming into the void) about the general quality of clips posted lately, so I have to acknowledge when it's done right - i.e. this one. Another Portuguese diving and getting carded lol. Great spot by the ref, clear dive People in the match thread screeching that the ref is bought and he's cheating and then this shit happens lmao. Zero sympathy. 3 consecutive yellows for diving you never sing that Boys who cried wolf Leaving your foot dangling into contact wins you a pen every week in the prem. At least some refs see sense. Honestly top class refererring This ref is mint wish more players got booked for diving / going down before they even get contact Loll leaves his leg out because he knows it'll get contact, nice try First good decision by this ref Ronaldo doing a drogba for a ref making a great call‚Ä¶ you have no power here this isn‚Äôt Saudi mate What a frustrating game for a Portugal supporter. Why even try to flop there? You just got past the defender? Agree with this one. Actually all 3 diving yellows so far were well shown.  On the other hand, the mega shirt pull doesn't even go to VAR ?  Weird There was contact, but it looked like he was going down prior to it. Shameless! Not a dive, Neto was shot by an elusive sniper. Neto, my guy ... please stop arguing and fuck off, that shit was embarrassing. Have some fucking self-awareness. good reffing here, remarkably inconsistent throughout the rest of the game though People who think this is a bad decision are fully okay with simulation in the sport. Well spotted. In general, it doesn‚Äôt get punished nearly enough. Clear dive.  Right in front of the ref too. This is the same as that el classico where vazquez gets the pen for real Why are some players clever and others cheaters when they leave a leg out and look for contact? Double standards much? Wtf Portuguese players look completely lost... They look like amateurs!  Ridiculous [deleted] I mean, sure he went for it, but it‚Äôs not a dive lol. The ref has something against Portugal, I‚Äôm sure. This ref... Yep, that was definitely a dive. Doesn't excuse him from the rest of the awful referreeing though. The Saka How can this be worthy of a yellow? Its contact. Ref couldve said its not a free kick and that he fell too easy, but how can a missed tackle that makes contact with his foot be a yellow for Neto? I mean he drags his left leg, but there is contact.  Going looking for contact and just falling at no contact is one thing, but there was contact..... Always find it funny when players go up to the ref with their hands behind their back to show they're not being aggressive [deleted] That sort of depth is a blessing for managers. Yellow for diving by Portugal this EURO, 100% consistency so far, impressive. Yeah but he's doing it left-footedly ü¶∂üèΩ [deleted] And worse, this Neto is really shit. Not all contact is a foul but idk And?  People do that all the time, and then he got contact, he didn't kick the Georgian player, the Georgian player went into his path.  By the definition of the laws of the game this is a foul, not a dive.  Is it a soft foul? Sure, but foul is a foul. That being said, they really abandoned the whole ""Only captains can discuss key decisions with the referee"" didn't they. The actual captain walked away lol Neto getting up to him to complain a getting a single finger wag to the face to fuck off makes it even better. Ehh... the Soviet judge somehow only scored it an 8.4 Sandro Sch√§rer really is a good ref This whole tournament has been great at reducing dives and ref harassment, imo He started diving before he was even touched Yeah, he's going down before the Georgian player even makes contact, actually really well-spotted by the ref. [deleted] Well yeah you can see in the replay he doesn‚Äôt bring his leg up to continue running. It‚Äôs immobile like he was hit with a traq dart and gets hit on purpose. Really hard to see in real time so I‚Äôm surprised the ref caught that Uh Portugal is really bad for it. Been that way for decades. Arguably worse than the Italians now.   They also complain more than any other European nation. Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, etc. Their greatest-ever player is one of the most infamous divers in the history of the sport. I wish refs were consistent with this in the tournament not only with us. Just yesterday Bellingham was diving and nothing was called Yet the fallon d'floor on the belgium game, as well as a lot of other dives this tournament, goes unpunished.  I am all for booking floppers and divers, but be consistent about it. It is a tad ridiculous that only one squad this entire tournament has been punished for something everyone else is doing. I love the idea that there's this UEFA conspiracy to screw over the team with the most famous player in the world, that generates more revenue than anybody in favour of little old Georgia. But then again, conspiracy theorists never were one for logic. Should have been his second yellow tbh. If refs really want to crack down on dissent, sending the most famous player in the tournament off for it would certainly get the message across. I think if Ronaldo was close to where the ball was it may have been. You could argue that the difference is leaving a leg in as in ‚Äúnot avoiding avoidable contact‚Äù, and leaving a leg in as in ‚Äúcreating contact out of nothing‚Äù. For making the right call? It‚Äôs a blatant dive, the Georgian guy completely pulls out and Neto stretches his leg while already in the air it's absolutely a dive lol. you can't start going down, intentionally stick your leg into the defender, and ask for a call. 100% a dive, he dangles his leg out to create the contact Yeah he never calls any actual fouls on Portugal either, he really hates Portugal for some reason Is doing well. Not taking any shite. You love to see it. i mean that is just the right decision ‚Ä¶made the correct decision. Well done referee. Because he was on his way down before any contact, and had Neto just ran normally, there wouldn't have been contact. Neto instigated the contact, outside of a normal running motion > Its contact.   Created by Neto, yes.  > Ref couldve said its not a free kick  It's more than ""not a free kick"", it's unsportsmanlike behaviour.   > how can a missed tackle that makes contact with his foot be a yellow for Neto?  Because Neto was flying before he was ""fouled"", and the intent was to implicate the Georgian player. If the Georgian player had got a yellow instead, do you think Neto would've said a fucking thing? Of course not.  There's really nothing to debate here, it's an obvious dive, and it's utterly shameful that Neto even tried to argue about it. He was falling before the contact, the contact didn't make him fall, on top of that he created the contact by sticking his leg out into the player, the Georgian payer pulls out of the tackle and would not have even touched Neto if Neto hadnt stuck his leg out Wow ü§¶ It's a bit like porn actresses wearing glasses to come across as intellectual. Didn't like 34 year old Ronaldo get sent off for diving against Barca The real geniuses are playing for Portugal and getting booked for diving when they are chosen to replace a teammate who can‚Äôt play because he got booked for diving. He still replaced him, doesn‚Äôt matter if he‚Äôs suspended or not‚Ä¶ genius. Hilariously terrible opinion Clearly dragged his foot, dive. Neto was dragging his feet so far he looked like Michael Jackson his leg gets touched, but not every touch is a foul. he threw himself like his legs were swept away which isn‚Äôt possible considering the amount of contact. he‚Äôs trying to deceive the referee which is a dive. >By the definition of the laws of the game >By the definition of the laws of the game this is a foul,  The Portuguese player instigated contact and then disingenuously acted unsportsmanlike.  It's a dive and a yellow card. Ref got it right. Ronaldo already got a yellow for complaining to the ref dont think he should be complaining any further. Probably a bit of leeway for those involved. I thought it was ""Captains and players who got carded"". The ref can then explain his decision to them in person. To be fair the actual captain got booked last time he discussed a key decision with the referee lol that rule doesn‚Äôt really make sense. what if the goalkeeper is the captain and a penalty for his team should be decided. he needs to run all over the pitch just to talk to the ref or what You wouldn't know it going by the match thread. just missed a penalty 10 minutes before this moment I love the obvious penalty he ignore, but great referee... He‚Äôs nearly spread eagle before he‚Äôs been touched  https://imgur.com/a/sufq4Z6 Naah, Italians and Spanish are just better at diving. Portugal is just shit at diving so you notice it more and they get more warnings. With the new rules about approaching the ref, I'm curious how that will end when the game gets tough. Portugal have always been notorious for it. They have a horrible Uruguay-ish outlook the ends justify the means and they will happily cheat their way to victory. All Latin countries. Coincidence? I THINK NOT One could say, the *Latin* way of playing Don't skip England pls France is the least bad by far. Which isn‚Äôt surprising given how physical they are. Come on  Maupay doesn‚Äôt dive that often Tf Well, it has to be identified as a dive before it can be dealt with accordingly. A player going down after minimal contact may be hard to distinguish from a genuine foul, depending on the situation. [deleted] He went down before the touch, but he did get tripped Neto's leg wasn't out.  The Georgian player still stepped towards his path. I'm not saying this isn't an extremely soft foul but to say it's all on Neto is ridiculous. [deleted] [deleted] Nah he's had a horrible season. Was shit when he came on against Turkey, was shit this half. How many more samples do you want? The penalty Georgia just got is as much contact, yet VAR requested a review, so if that's enough for a pen, where's Ronaldo's shirt grab in the box? The Portuguese player's foot went forward, the Georgian player put his foot in the way.  By the definition it's a foul.  I'm not saying it's not soft or that I like it, but this happens every week, and the way the rules are worded it is a foul.   If this were in the box, I'd hope it would be given a pen, just like the Georgian pen.  That Georgian player also didn't need to go down, the amount of contact was insignificant, but there was contact. You're allowed to complain, lol. You just can't yell at the ref. Neto wasn't yelling, but according to the report ahead of the tournament he's not even supposed to be discussing the decision with the referee. That's Ronaldo's job. ""Discussed"" is one way of putting it. Discussed at the top of his voice too! You select a delegate, (vice-captain most likely). I doubt there's ever been a match thread in which a ref didn't get shat on, let alone get praise lol This is what I look like asleep. yeah i probably shouldn't have included them honestly Well he's French but fair. He got better about it as time went on, but Ronaldo from his debut at United until around 2014-15 was notorious for diving. Nothing he said is wrong Give it a break man If he went down before the touch how is it not a dive? The contact only happened during the dive, and because of the particular way he dived. If only we had a word for that lol He‚Äôs the one that initiates the trip lol, he just throws his leg out That means it's not a foul lol. So you replace the suspended player? What does that have to do with anything? Is it only a replacement if you don‚Äôt have to do it? Are you one of those people that have to wear a helmet indoors? Respectfully, you're a fucking idiot. Player of the season inarguably for us before he got injured. Had the assist against czech republic, and is playing with no space and in a different position today.  I would also prefer more then 90 minutes of game to define him as a player. These are wildly different scenarios. Yeah but it isnt easy to calm yourself down to talk in a normal tone filled with adrenaline and angry. The same war Gordan Ramsey discusses mistakes in his kitchens. He just stopped dribbling, he never stopped being a diver lol. [deleted] [deleted] He‚Äôs also been totally adequate today. Delivered a couple of really inviting balls into the box and had the incisive pass for the Ronaldo chance. Sometimes I don‚Äôt understand how people see the things they see. A bit, but look at the levels of contact, the impact on the game.  If that level of contact constitutes a pen, how was the level of contact on Neto considered a dive? And yet Neto managed to. Wrong take. He didn‚Äôt blame him at all, he just thought it was funny that Leao can‚Äôt play because of diving then his replacement got booked for the same thing Never become a ref please üôè Did I say it was imposible? [deleted] Did I say it was easy? I really don‚Äôt think it does man but okay, fair enough [deleted] Really not trying to be a dick (I also have it), but maybe this is an autism thing? To me it‚Äôs very obvious what he meant, not sure how I can explain it? I read it, then I understand it"

Fuck Jeff Shi. Not only does he price thousands of fans out of attending matches, he then sells two of our best players and gives our manager scraps in return! These threads on this sub are always a wasteland. It's nothing but big club fans trying to pawn off their trash or shake their ass for our players.   That said, fuck Fosun. They can spin it however they want, but I don't trust them whatsoever. They should really go for Kiwior, still young, good with feet and can play across back Damn, where‚Äôd the ¬£70m goü§® Lindelof or Maguire are ready lads. We'll sell you Michael Keane, Mason Holgate and Neal Maupay for a combined ¬£20m Not super concerned personally as I believe the only position of need atm is a cb and 20m should well cover that. Also the team has too many forwards at the moment that need to be sold anyways.  The problem is that last summer after selling the likes of Neves our chairman said:  >The positive thing is that FFP is based on a rolling number, season by season, so if we do manage it well this summer, next summer we will be more free financially.  https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/club/20230803-jeff-shi-letter-to-supporters/  Meaning either he lied or the club employs some pretty bad accountants. Would like to see this addressed as the increased ticket prices and now this haven't made it a good summer for our owners. Wolves are good with their money, Foxes not so much üò≠üò≠ Which are those fringe players? lol 20M is exactly one David Carmo. curious to see it Mendes can still work his magic with Porto without pinto da costa¬† Hey Wolves‚Ä¶. Have you heard the good word about Lindelof???!! Buy him on the cheap. Get him off our books plz. Is it FFP or are they just skint They're always in administration in FM so I see this as a good idea haha We are willing to loan you Ashley Phillips. He needs consistent playing time and I think it would be great for his development.  You could then spend that money elsewhere. Stop playing hard to get and sell us Podence then :)  He's literally shouting he wants to return to us. one Joao Gomes please Lindelof for 15m take it or leave it Man needs to sort himself out first Lol Worth the money tbf To be fair, whilst I know he isnt doing it for this reason, its good for your long term psr. You were a bit financially handcuffed last year What do your tickets cost now then? The owners used to be very ambitious at one point right? What happened then? Still sold their season ticket allocation They used to be very ambitious at one point right? What happened then? Makes Everton a big club? It‚Äôs actually a good shout but there are rumors that Kiwior is only interested in a move back to Serie A. I think both Wolves and Palace would be good destinations for him. He could be solid here, he's a similar profile to Toti: left sided defender, can play CB or LB. But I think we're looking to spend our money on more of an out and out aggressive, physical CB. Wolves have a small ground , no European football and small sponsorship deals  They've spent big since being back in the PL  2022 wolves gambled on Guedes 30 million, sasa 18 million and 45 million Nunes , spent 55 million on Chunha   2020 Fabio 40 million, 10 million hoever  2019 18 million on Cruntone They were in a FFP bind last year too, they're probably trying to make a larger profit this year to stabilize their financial situation. They still have a solid squad more than capable of surviving, and that's enough for them now since the path to Europe is near impossible even with investments this year. So far we've spent around \~33m:  \*15m on Rodrigo Gomes   \*10m on Pedro Lima   \*3m loan fee, 27m option on Jorgen Strand Larsen   \*5m on Tommy Doyle  If we spend another 20m, then that leaves a chunk for January. Dont think we want to sell Maguire. Lindelof yes We won't sell Maguire, we'd need to replace him and at this stage, it'll be expensive.   Lindelof is injured, don't know how serious though. Are we paying them that amount to take them? Lmao How did Maupay end up at Everton again. He was so much better for Brentford. I guess some of the ones that are back from loan. Fabio, Podence, Guedes, Sasa, Chiquinho and maybe Mosquera. Sarabia has been rumoured to go as well. Neither, higher ups just don‚Äôt want to spend Your club won't pay so he's likely away to Al-Shabab Good add tbh , 7 years PL experience played about 250 +times for MU , Sweden captain . Decent attributes all round ( Strength, Passing, Aerial, Positioning ) and he is not in decline yet , We just upgraded on him Got away with a clear as day red card for violent conduct, so it's already working I'd guess. We are allowed spend around 200m apparently at the moment, think the neto and kilman money at least should be reinvested. The team is going backwards It's not about PSR. We're in no danger of that at all. It's not for PSR, as the other two commenters have said. That was what last summer was about. This year should've been about reinvesting the money we received, but evidently that's not happening. ¬£950 for a season ticket behind the goal, a ¬£500 increase since 2018 (first season back in PL). I cancelled my season ticket just on the principle of it. Chinese no longer interested in investing in foreign football clubs. They won't say it out loud but we're up for sale. I think them getting burned on big transfers multiple times within a year or so has freaked them out. They missed on: Fabio, Guedes, Cutrone, Hoever, Trincao, and Sasa Kalajdzic. They basically broke even on guys like Nathan Collins and Nunes. Combine those misses with covid and the ffp scare last year, and I'm not surprised they're being more conservative.   Also, realistically, we're not a big club. Our finances are definitely mid-table level, but it's not enough for us to consistently reach Europe or pay massive wages on long term contracts. So now they're trying to simply stabilize us and follow a model closer to Brighton. Buy young, cheap talent, sell on for big fees later, repeat. Political climate in China.   Investing in foreign football went from a CCP-endorsed way to project soft power, to an embarrassing demonstration of excess.   Wolves fans are understandably frustrated, but you can't hold it against the individuals who own the club as they're just trying to avoid getting disappeared. Tbf I thought Mosquera is already quite physical and aggressive maybe you need a skillful ball-player to complement that üò≠ (no puns intended) 40 million for Fabio Silva still makes me laugh. wtf Forgot about Fabio Silva‚ò†Ô∏è They have 32k, obviously it's smaller than many prem grounds but it's not that small. Also the Jorge Medes stuff that we dont know I have never heard of some of these people, you could be making them up and I'd never know. Cruntone? I know that Pat didn't impress many people but that's a nickname I hadn't heard before lol great insight here, why did they have to spend so much on Chunha and fucking Cruntone So in total around 100 or so on players that aren't great and the rest on quality players who would cost others the same. In the space of 5 years.   And the big six make 100m mistakes all the time, but because they are big clubs they are allowed but little old wolves have to sell all their players because they don't have revenue.  Make it make sense The owner isn‚Äôt Chinese and all Chinese owners can‚Äôt spend a lot of money at the moment. Fees are amortised over length of the contract up to 5 years max, you should have plenty more wiggle room realistically unless something is going on that I haven't heard june 25 contract. 32. signed 2 CBs for 100m. Think they were desperate for a striker. He was on loan and Brentford didnt want to buy Mosquera won't leave and no one is buying Sasa. I'd add Cundle, Hoever, and Hodge in there too, though we won't get much for any of them unfortunately. Yes we will definitely sell our best cb üôÑ Any chance RAN goes to Liverpool? Till you're in a relegation battle.. Then all of a sudden 50m comes out. [deleted] Great passer! Great ball carrier as well! Never actually puts a foot wrong! Lindelof is actually a superb player! Bro take a day off like Arsenal fans even having meltdowns over refs in games they win, reaching a new level here? Why is he not spending? That‚Äôs really ridiculous. I assume that‚Äôs also the cheapest, or one of the cheapest STs as well? Normally the sides can be considerably more   Mine in the same spot at St Mary‚Äôs was ¬£500, it went down a bit in the Champo but I‚Äôve never paid more than ¬£570   And we‚Äôre in the south where everything is more expensive! Damn that's shit. I pay 880 for my villa season ticket. Ours have gone up exponentially as well. Mine was 540 around about the time yours was 500. 650 for Everton. Keeping proces down is perhaps the only decent thing Moshiri has done. I wish they would, honestly. We need to be sold before we fall back into Championship mediocrity. Haha I think we want both. Ideally a CB that can play in a back 4 with Mosquera, or centrally in a back 5 flanked by Mosq and Toti. That's what happens when you get in bed with Mendes Money laundering Yeah, that's how finances work.   The more you make the more you can spend. Urr yeah that's how it should work. Wolves spending loads on mistakes should hamstring them in the future, not give their owner the ability to throw more money until he decides one day he doesn't give a fuck, neither should wolves (or newcastle, or villa etc) be allowed to win the league solely because someone rich bought them.  Also, whilst some clubs make more mistakes than others, the only truly affected ones in are united and Chelsea. United are a marketing machine, and this helps them, whilst Chelsea have the best academy in the country and can sell academy players for ¬£20 odd million.  Current Arsenal, Liverpool, City & Spurs are all pretty well run Just be glad you aren't us. I wish users here would stop only looking at transfer fees. It's really not that simple. These players are also on wages. There are bonuses, sign on fees, agent fees, etc. Yes we should have more money to spend, but money spent now means less for January. And a club our size needs to make sure we have money for January in case we are in a spot where we need to spend to stay up. Both Maguire and Lindelof have till 25 with option till 26. Maguire's a better player plus HG. I think we want to get rid of Lindelof now and sell Maguire next summer and buy Branthwaite to go 2 right footed CBs and 2 left footed CBs. That doesn't really answer the question. Seems unlikely as we sent our backup LB Hugo Bueno on loan. Would leave us with Doherty or Toti (with Dawson covering CB) as left back. No chance. Our tier 1 said the other day that we refuse to entertain offers for him this summer. They won't sell Neto, Kilman, and RAN in one window. Now next summer... that's when him, Joao Gomes, etc will start to get targeted. Not a hope without another LB being signed. Yep, the want to spend just enough for the premier league revenue to keep coming It looks like Podence may stay. He came on at the end of last week against Arsenal. So no you parasite we aren't giving him to you for free. At no point did Podence request to leave. There are no social media rumors just Olympiakos weirdo supporters in every Twitter post saying the same thing. If someone just paid for him he would go... HE IS SO GOOD. THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN. HE WINS THOSE BALLS SO MUCH THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE TIRED OF WINNING. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SAYING MR. O‚ÄôNEIL WE ARE TIRED OF CLEAN SHEETS He‚Äôs an Arsenal fan. He doesn‚Äôt know how to How do you get meltdown from that?? You need to chill, mate, if that's what you think. I was very clearly joking. I don't care either way. Wolves aren't rivals, and we easily beat them.... why in the world would I be angry!? Just the way football is going these days. For better or for worse, domestic football for me is not at a top level and my wallet is [much better](https://www.shamrockrovers.ie/2023/10/31/2024-season-ticket-renewals-are-live/) for it The agent of Joao felix... Lindelof aint getting sold this window. he s on crutches.  players have to agree to the option to extend too and he wont cause he wont get another contract at United and he s unsellable as it is cause we gotta pay him off to go and nobody s paying real money for somone they d have to pay 150k a week (40k pay cut still for him) at 32.   he ll run his contract down unless he s sold now or Jan. idk when Lindelof's contract ends, if he wasnt injured he d be sold this window even though we d be better off keeping him and not had renewed Evans but.. whatever.. united s at least 5 years away from shifting all the deadwood out and if you think i m wrong just remember we employ Antony and nobody is ever gonna buy him. Seems odd with Bueno. He seemed okay no? Im guessing both us and Tsimikas would be open to him going the other way Arteta taught us to always stay alert. For all we know, this thread could be another one of his tests. You can't honestly think I care about this lol? We won easily. And Wolves are mid-table fodder, at best. It was a joke.  Only thing that actually pissed me off this weekend was that fucking bum Bowen. Last time I take an FPL punt on your shitty ass team lol. What kinda captain gets taken off when you need a goal?? ü§£ You‚Äôre way over performing your Xpunctuation-marks/comment here Yeah I can‚Äôt blame you.

Man has his dirty paws everywhere He regressed a lot defensively. There's also an open question as to whether he can play in a 4. Jesus Christ, you guys really are unbearable.

The entitled arrogance of 99% of them is astounding. You would think they were Man City the way they act."

Incredible player but signing him is a big risk Hope we invest in more beds for our medical ward In the early stages of the season I'd be annoyed it's not north of ¬£70m, but I think we'd do well to get ¬£60m with his injury record.  Obviously you want to keep your exciting players, and he's incredible to watch when he's fully fit. The issue is that's been quite rare during his time at Wolves.  If it could mean we're able to keep Ait-Nouri and Joao Gomes while adding more quality to the rest of the squad then I'm sure the vast majority of Wolves fans would be ok with this. Man City would probably suit him where he could be rotated more to build up some injury resistance. newcastle keep getting linked to players with a poor injury record I wanted the season to end so badly but I forgot that means the endless cycle of transfer rumours linking our best players away begins. There‚Äôs no winning right now.   Butter the toast, eat the toast, shit the toast. God life is relentless. he will go for ¬£45m max imo, nobody in their right mind is paying ¬£60m for like 20 games a season (except maybe chelsea who don‚Äôt seem to need another winger) Neto at Man City wouldn‚Äôt even be fair. But when would he play? Love Neto, but he's always fucking injured. His style may always be problematic. This dude puts the burners on, incredible bursts of pace, which will always stress his legs. Even if you say he'll play less minutes for a big side, there's zero guarantee he makes it out of those minutes healthy. It's not like all of his injuries have been from overuse.   That said, when he's healthy he's really good. If he stayed healthy we are talking about a 80-100m player. Hmm, got the looks off a Man United signing. Poor injury record, City & Arsenal potentially in for him. Not required. Ticks all the boxes for a solid 80M acquisition. If it's in the telegraph and we are 'targeting' or 'closing in on' then we ain't , trust me from experience lol Yes, yes, everyone focus on Neto and look away from Eze and Olise üëÄ his fitness record makes him a huge dice throw Honestly seems like a bargain if they can keep him fit, but that's a pretty big if Surely not with his fitness record? I'd want to see him manage a whole season without serious injury before putting ¬£60m on him if it's true that savio is coming to city i'd rather just stay with him and give those additional minutes to Oscar Bobb [deleted] Earlier reports indicated that he could be one of our targets but it seems that his injury record made us reconsider. Straight swap for Nunes. Keep swapping out your flops. Neto at City please no He got injured after hearing the news and jumping in celebration nah Another scam?? Would love him at Liverpool but he‚Äôs so fragile Does Newcastle even have that money? i dont see Arsenal buying Bruno but PSG maybe? Does anyone even care who City sign anymore?  If they dont get Neto they will get the next option. There is zero excitement or interest around their signings I Diaz is leaving I thought Neto would be one of the names we‚Äôd go for. I can‚Äôt really think of many left wingers that may be available to us Dude has a poor injury record. 60 mil is a huge risk. At this point City is buying players just so other teams don't have the players. Crazy money for a walking injury, but neither ownerships care much about the value of money, so good luck to them i guess. Pssst, Wolves: it‚Äôs Man City. Make them double that number. bleed em dry boys Not for city. If he‚Äôs sitting 50% of the game anyway. Consistently hurt forward you say? Good he can play chess with Wilson in the hospital beds. ¬£60M is chump changes for City, what's 1 more FFP Charge? He needs to go to City, then. One more good player for them to keep on the bench and rarely play. Watch as he turns those 44% into 98% at City Makes city the ideal landing place for him tbh. He‚Äôll have no pressure to play unless he‚Äôs fully fit. Not to mention Pep‚Äôs specials doctors back in Germany, they can fix anything. It's $60M but for only one hamstring The other right winger we are linked with is Olise. Very funny after this season... I've resigned myself to losing one of Neto, RAN, Gomes, and possibly Cunha. I just hope it's *only* one, and then funds raised from selling Silva/Guedes/Podence etc. should give us enough to play with this summer. Delusional if you think you're getting more than 40¬£ m for a therapist's companion. Then there's Gordon who played every game. I feel him and Bruno were only players that were available whole season and played almost every game.¬† Hi Kalvin Phillips went for around that and barely played. Man City can manage that and he would be perfectly balanced load wise. Newcastle on the other hand who have had their season ruined by injuries should likely err on the side of caution because while Neto is exciting and all, no way he can be relied upon for long stretches Lol If Silva leaves this Summer there‚Äôs a huge chunk of minutes available on the right wing that need to be filled. He‚Äôs likely to be rotated but like we saw with Doku this year, that should do wonders for his injury record I‚Äôd much rather play Bobb more, anyway. I highly doubt you will be pay the required fee for Olise. Eze maybe but Olise will command probably close to ¬£100m especially from another English club. I‚Äôm confused. Isn‚Äôt the Savio deal done? [deleted] Tbf if he is a Saka back up it's still pretty good especially when Saka is always playing Yes we do, without selling anyone too. >Does Newcastle even have that money?  That money is what a Saudi Prince gives as a tip to a Burger King waiter There was a lot of interest around the Savio signing tbf We can't afford to take a risk on such an injury prone player. why is Diaz leaving? They rarely ever overpay though. Just went through this with Nunes Ah yes, bleed dry the two state owned clubs with endless money. City players are basically always fit anyway. Literally they go to City and all their chronic injuries disappear and they‚Äôre perfectly load managed throughout their time there Or he disappears from public consciousness like nunes Who would be the least painful player to lose ? You must keep cunha at least another 2 seasons. RemindMe! 3 Months We back baby delusional as ever. Just clocked you support the Tesco carrier bags as well. Hilarious Gordon played every game except the games he didn't hahah He literally didn't play the last game lol.... He does miss them. Kalvin Phillips didn't take a foreign player slot, though. PL clubs will always be happy to pay a premium for that factor. We have a story about Silva leaving city every summer, at this point the lad is gonna retire there Savio and Bobb exist I mean Neto gets injured barely playing at Wolves. I don't think it's anything to do with being overplayed, he's just one of those players who's made of glass it seems (sadly). We simply have no need for Neto. Savio and Bobb No release clause in Olise‚Äôs contract? Think it's more to do with will he stay at City or be shipped out Their injury record is nothing short of remarkable ¬£60m on a Saka backup really isn't good business though, especially when he'd want a good wage around the ¬£150k mark at a City/Arsenal level club. yes ofc but they seem to care about FFP rules. for now atleast I know but I think left wing can be a tricky position to fill right now Just a lot of rumours circulate around him and his Dad opens his mouth quite a lot about him dreaming of playing for Barca or Real. PSG and Barca are the only places he‚Äôd go this summer but it depends if he looks to force a move Such a weird coincidence, truly no explanation for it Cause for this effect is already explained in the comment you replied too. There is no pressure to play certain players. Players only play when fully fit and never rushed back from even a knock. Except Rodri, he's just built different. On the other hand, the one other player Pep didn't behave like that about was KDB and he did break down completely as a result, as admitted by pep himself. The whole squad always seems to operate at 115% Not even sure if this is true besides Rodri? De bryuyne and Stones are always injured. Grealish and Haaland injured a lot this year too Like Halland or Kdb ? Well if you‚Äôre Grealish and you go from playing 100% of minutes to a nice option in the last 20-30 minutes, I imagine you‚Äôll stay healthy more often Probably Neto. We've seen that we can play quite decently without him even though his blistering pace and dribbles put us into a whole other level. Without Cunha's midfield to attack link up, Gomes' ball winning in midfield and Ait nouris versatility we were pretty dead this season What the other commenter said. I love Neto to bits and it'd be painful to lose any of them, but probably him the least. ayo You've robbed them blind. Well played. Before that he was playing continuously even when their other attackers got injured. Only games he missed before that were due to suspensions.¬† He has a 50m release clause any club can activate now, for a player of his quality, every top club would be after that Don‚Äôt they play on the left? ah ok, makes sense from his POV but I don't see that happening.   he's a great player but a bit inconsistent/injury prone. Idk if PSG/Barca would want him and be willing to pay the fee LFC would ask for  unless he forces a move like you said That Doctor in Barcelona that Pep loves must have some revolutionary medicines and treatments at his disposal. Except that it's not really true. KdB, Grealish, Stones, Ake all had decent spells I juried this year.  They benefit from a deep squad that they rotate pretty often and the fact that a lot of their games are lower intensity where they are just in their front half playing keepings off, much less end to end than a lot of teams have to deal with.  The only true freak of nature that they overplay without breaking is Rodri, man just keeps backing up but I do think they are aware that they do need someone half decent as a regular reserve. Ake, stones and grealish have had several injuries this season. Kdb missed half the season ffs and haaland was missing at the beginning of the year even ederson had some injury woes. The only super reliable player is rodri and he still plays less than bruno for you guys A good explanation for it would be that it's not true in the slightest, for one. City has a lot of injuries, they just win anyway Well it Better physios, better rotation, style of play that‚Äôs easier on the body. Still have plenty of injuries Google Manchester City 115 for more info It's not, these dumbfucks are forgetting that City had Stones, De Bruyne, Ake and Jack at least riddled with injuries this season. Your form since he's been out has been close to horrendous Bobb is on the right Thiago has entered the chat Surely its not the same doctor he had blamed when he failed his two drug tests. Horse placenta. Dr. Cugat üíâüíâüíâüíâüíâü©∏ü©∏ They suffered their injuries during preseason or away at international duty.   Most of the injuries are mostly niggles and nothing major so they recover quickly. The way that city play too also encourages less injuries. I.e. no high impact running or counter attacks. Simple pass and move and maintain possession.   Man City don‚Äôt have a deep squad, far from it. With the wage bill of certain key players like KdB , Haaland and Rodri, they are spread thin in terms of wages. They can‚Äôt carry a big 30 man squad . They only have 19 first team players and the rest filled by youngsters like Lewis and Bobb.   What they do have are players capable of playing in multiple positions and different roles. Fluidity is what they have amongst their world class players. And this is across the entire squad. Akanji for instance can play anywhere amongst the back four and cdm if necessary.   There‚Äôs a reason why Pep rests players after they performed well in the previous game. It‚Äôs something that only City are doing. Yep and even in previous seasons key players such as Kompany, Mendy, Stones, Gundo, KdB were on the treatment table most of the time. Doesn‚Äôt fit their agenda tho Our end of season wasn't awful because Neto was out. It was because Neto, Dawson, Bellegarde, Hwang, and Cunha were all out for a good portion of the last 10 games. We were playing Lemina up front with a 17 year old at one point.  We obviously had a shocking run in, but it wasn't because of Neto. Probably explains why most of them are losing their hair.  They just want to be like Pep so much! No thanks. I‚Äôve had my dinner. The agenda is that you spend illegally to have a squad where you have a rotational option of 100m left wing"

Nice. Keep it up Chelsea. Now a Mudryk goal to cap off a fine night pls Mudryk assist, league‚Äôs fucked I‚Äôm liking the squad depth we have I know it's Barrow but Mudryk with an assist? I must be dreaming Well done he's 13 That was a quick counter. Well played all of them The world isn‚Äôt ready for Carabao Cup Mudryk the ball bouncing over the guys head in the build up lol Porch used to make these games look hard üò≠ Odd celebration from Neto for 4-0 against Barrow but Chelsea are always a must watch for me. [AA/Replay](https://streamff.co/v/3f35caff) It‚Äôs a good reminder that there are levels to this. Mudryk and Neto are closer to prime Messi than we are to them. The league 2 players probably are too. This is real hate watching always rated Carlisle lmao OOTL, why the hate watching? At least we reached this round League Two* I would hope so considering this attack is worth like 300 million and you are playing Barrow You cannot be serious first goal for chelsea I'm sure had something to do with it That's just his celebration. Sometimes it is awkward tho lmao First goal for the club Why probably? Do you play professional football? Of course they are lmao Any semi/pro level athlete is closer to them than regular people. I think every single player in this match would look like prime Messi in a Sunday League game. But on the other hand I'm way better than them at Excel spreadsheets so I'd say it evens out. what >Mudryk and Neto are closer to Messi than we are to them.  not in ucl titles they are not Carlisle United fan, I think the only other EFL club in Cumbria (very remote afaik) Cheers mate didn‚Äôt know that Mate ur best player got booted from our squad for profit Ooooooh, had no idea that‚Äôs how that worked. Thanks for pointing that out. We barely eked out a win against league 2 Wimbledon. It was ridiculous Depends how it judge - there are plenty of technical people at sunday games that are in terrible shape so it that way they are closer to Messi than a bunch of pros and semi-pro guys who are super physical but the ball bounces off them like their legs are made of lead. Oh yeah? Bet you didn't even participate in the excel world cup. He's saying Messi is shit spurs fan talking about ucl titles, lmao Good to know I'm the same as any spurs player Congrats? Lets not pretend that last season he wasnt your second best player. It doesnt matter if they got booted from your squad because selling a player from chelsea doesnt mean anything other than $. If it makes them pure profit theyll gladly accept it, doesnt matter how good they are. And we gave you our worst player in exchange haha you also lost to Servette [This is one of the best satires I‚Äôve seen, Major League Excel](https://youtu.be/xubbVvKbUfY?si=MVCmhq6f6SUvH5I0) You get it not sure how my being a spurs fan has anything to do with the point in question baby flair up or your shittalk doesn't count unfortunately 2nd best midfielder perhaps. That said Connor deserves all the success at Atleti and most of us still cheer for him. Last season he was our best midfielder. Caicedo was struggling early to mid season until he hired a trainer to work on his positioning. Enzo struggled whole season. And now they‚Äôre both thriving. Everyone‚Äôs happy. You and that other guy tho could use a dirty slap. A europa league quality team? It was a poor performance, but there's a big difference between playing away on a shit pitch against a team good enough to play in Europe and never being behind on aggregate vs. playing at home against a midtable league 2 team where you need to win to go through Not sure how UCL titles have anything to do with the point of JRsshirt I prefer not to use flair since many people vote depending on your flair. I would have been Chelsea enzo really should have rushed to leave benfica. another half season would have helped him a lot but his head got turned. conference league a random measure out of my ass to show that ""closer"" is not definitive It's quite clear what their meaning was, and their comment conveys that.

Have it expire on June 33rd = lifetime contract Maybe Chelsea knows something the rest of the top clubs in Europe don't. Simple Jack is locked in. Holyy shit 9 years??? Cant even get it in FM Wow great piece of business once again from Barca with Vitor Roque's signing that mudryk contract is hysterical. shitting away millions indefinitely for absolutely no gain. genius Looks like whatever Chelsea has is starting to affect West Ham also. Rest of London clubs beware. we gave roque 7 years to sell him to fucking betis Long Bilbao contract vs Long Chelsea contract is flirting vs sexual harassment  EDIT: Yes guys I understand why Bilbao do long contracts. That's the entire point of them being 'flirting' and not 'sexual harrassment' Eghbali is Mr Burns Alan Pardew eat your heart out Infinite athlete is the perfect sponsor for this club if you think about it ‚ôæÔ∏è Did Chelsea plan to hire 2-3 managers too? If Cole Palmer is still at Chelsea in three years I'll accept the manager's job there because they'll be down to interviewing candidates who've had a mildly good season on FIFA. Players just love chelsea Fuck transfermarket! Go to their site and you'll be prompted with cookies and a choice: Either accept ALL cookies from their 130 ""partners"" which they call ""free with ads and tracking"", or pay them. There's no option to reject cookies and use their site. What scummy pieces of shit.   It's illegal af and a practice that really should land them in hot water. So again, fuck transfermarket. I think I'm probably missing something but I thought the length of time loophole you could spread the purchase cost of the player was reduced after Chelsea first started using it.  Is it now 5 years the fee can be spread over?  If so why are the more recent buys like Neto still spread over 7+ years Wtf are Athletic doing? 8 year contracts, are they stupid? People are so naive man. Aside from 4 players on the list with 8 and 9 years, 100s of players in Europe are signed for 7 years, they just decided to put Chelsea ones at the top so it looks like that (because of Palmer and Enzo) Who the f is J√∏rgensen? Cmon muddy my boy, you can get right. You're the only one I'm worried about.   I'm still going to lean on the ongoing war in Ukraine. I'm not sure how focused I would be while my friends, family, and extended are dying or fighting. Their population has reduced by over 6 million people since the war started.   The media has softened on the coverage but the war rolls on.   Hope your mental can stay sharp Misha.   Slava Ukraine. I assumed this was posted as an opportunity to shit on Chelsea. I'm here for it Why would a player like Palmer sign for 9 years. If he signed for 4 couldn't he then get a big wage increase if he keeps performing the way he is?   I don't know why a player would want to sign for that long How much total money has Chelsea committed to paying players? Did Fernandez get an extension? Although I do like a lot of the Chelsea players, don't think Enzo is not up to the level Chelsea would like him to be. Might be one of the all time blunders especially with they way the transaction panned out.¬† Players are an operating cost in this model. Use clubs revenue to cover wages + amortization costs. In 5 years, all these players are now pure profit, because they have been paid for using club revenue and they have 2 years left on contract.  Add in players accept lower wages with bonuses for a longer contract and Chelsea also has an advantage in being able to move players on.  Rinse and repeat, hit some WC winners to keep, some players to develop and sell at a profit and some players which don‚Äôt pan out selling at book profit or slight loss.  Clearlake is hedging for inflation and betting big on that. The trend in the last 30 years in football is one of inflation Welcome to death row records Most players with the longest contacts in the top five leagues, you'll never sing that! Chelsea should get a full 2.5-3 years of football out of Neto. [deleted] lol ffs Chelsea [deleted] Irrelevant, but why does that kit have the IA sponsor in the graphic? Palmer will be 31 in the. Next 7 years operation Boehly is about to be lit. Goofy ahh club Contracts going to 2033 make me feel old as fuck. Isn't it a double edged sword? For the player and the team? surprised to see Vitor Roque there for us instead of Lamine infinite athlete made me laugh out loud Kilman is 27 and just signed that?! These contracts, generally speaking, favour the players more than than the clubs. If a player wants to leave 2 years into a 7 year contract, the club will sell him. So the contract doesn't mean anything to the player. If however the player falls out of favour and isn't picked to play in the third year of his contract, he can happily sit on the bench for 5 years picking up his paycheck. Again the player wins.  The club only wins and part way through the players contract if another club comes in and offers to buy the player for big money. Judging by that list, theres at least 7 clelsea players that need to be renegotiating their contracts now. Cole Palmer with the prison sentence Roque with 7 years when it‚Äôs unlikely he lasts 7 months of another season Lots of Chelsea players It‚Äôs like the sterling situation he‚Äôs got 3 years left on 350k a week that‚Äôs ¬£52 million left why would he want to leave that ? Committing* Vitor roque lol Signed Vitor Roque on a 7 year deal, and we're already trying to ship him out.   The state of this club... My stupid brain started reading this as... Jun 31? What are these guys smoking? some of these will still be playing for Chelsea in hell after the world burns to death¬† So I get offering a young player with a lot of potential a long contract, and the idea that 'they'll be worth more in the future when we sell', but a decade is so long in football and nothing is certain. What's to say Palmer doesn't completely drop off or get injured in that 9 year span? Unless they have some voluntary agreement or he agrees to leave they then could be paying a ton of money for little return Is Palmer okay in that photo? !flair :Flair_Name:FIFA¬† Imagine playing for Chelsea for the next decade almost lol Is there much chance Chelsea could 'do a Leeds'?  Seems a very risky (i.e. bat-shit crazy) business model Barcelona giving Roque 7 years and immediately deciding they don't actually want him is... Something. Like a served time sheet in Shawshank redemption. Just need to see the carving above the Chelsea cafeteria ""Eden was here"" I'm sensing a pattern... I‚Äôm so old that my brain immediately went to Carlton Palmer. Chelsea is just me on FIFA.  Renegotiate contract with players every half season to add an additional year.  Ended up with 8 year+ contract pretty soon 7 years of Nicolas Jackson? That should be gods punishment Uh oh, West Ham, looks like the Boehly Kool-Aid has leaked into the Thames and flowed east... EVERY ONE OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL DISAPPOINT I didn't think Bartomeu would return to football management after the damage he caused in FC Barcelona, but I see Chelsea offered him a job Jackson for 7 years, oh my god First I had thought Chelsea were stupid but they are clearly trolling Those Chelsea players better get along. They‚Äôre gonna be stuck together for a long time I somehow get the feeling Chelsea bets that Saudis are going to keep dumping money into players.  What a return of investment. Ok Google, how can I too get signed by Chelsea These contracts must have some negotiation clause of some sort right?  For example, let's say Palmer who I believe is on 130k, becomes prime Messi all of a sudden, no way he stays on 130k for rest of the contract Its still weird maresca wont play a lot of those on long contracts. There are two distinct possibilities  A - Chelsea are geniuses and have some of the best talent in the world on long contracts  B - Chelsea are stupid and will be stuck paying wages for players they cannot move on How do these kids get expired on June 33, 32 and 31 June only has 30 days. Who is veiga and jogenson. Chelsea learning from Man United it seems üòÇ what the fuck are they thinking with those contracts This is really gunna pay dividends for Chelsea in the coming years‚Ä¶ watch. Shoutout oihan sanchet what a baller Imaging Chelsea FC having 8 players in the Top 10. Isn't the Chelsea model based on US sports contracts? where, similar to Spain, the players are contracted to the league rather than directly by the teams. Could it really mess things up if they just put  ""June 2033""? This confused the junk out of me for way too long. Every time I see these graphics it's always a Chelsea or a Chelsea player topping Death tow You can understand Bilbao signing up basque players for a long while cause they have such a small pool to select from.  It‚Äôs like a slow motion multi-car pile up with Chelsea. Just patiently waiting for it all to go up in flames. Chelsea showing loyalties to players. Would rather put them to train with academy than sell them. Why does Palmer always look so‚Ä¶slow in all his media pics? Is that part of his branding or something, like salt of the earth/dim looking??? If not surely they can take better pics of him! Aha thats maybe why efc couldnt get wan bisaka then.  7 year contract is mental .  Players can just put their feet up if they dont get on with a new manager or something chelsea have fucked themselves something decent havent they Honestly if you have a 8 year contact what is the motivation to do anything? Vitor Roque lmao. He's gonna be on loan for those 7 years I love reading about players like Sterling and Chilwell being forced to train alone.  If you choose to join Chelsea, you deserve whatever comes with that. They know what they‚Äôre getting into before they sign Vitor Roque got 7.5 years on the get go.  Comments when on this when he signed has aged like wine.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/18rxyj5/fc\_barcelona\_vitor\_roque\_has\_arrived\_in\_barcelona/](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/18rxyj5/fc_barcelona_vitor_roque_has_arrived_in_barcelona/) Chelsea is such a meme of a club. You‚Äôd think one gets bored of these Chelsea nonsense posts, but no it just gets better and funnier. Clearly Lon contrast help you sign players but tbh I think a long contract only makes the player lazy Looks like prison sentences. Can't wait for Chelsea to sign someone for life without parole. Chelsea fan here. For a moment I thought 'when did we sign Vivian and Sancet?' Chelsea üíÄüíÄüíÄ How many times are we going to see the same infographic recycled in different ways for karma. We get it. Chelsea hand out stupidly long contracts. Is Kilman that good? Very smart business. Apart from the amortization effects, this also protects the club from wage-inflation that will certainly continue to impact soccer. Oooh the way i will celebrate palmers downfall will be legendary....9 year contract for penalty merchant ü§°ü§°ü§° ok so? Vitor Roque was given a 8 year contract only to sell him 1 year later? Really surprised to see him there, westham rate that much huh, also how much they paying him? Arguably West Ham too. He's a great defensive full back and he's tied down on 90k for 7 years which is not a huge wage for his quality. there we land I gasped. Yeah West Ham are gonna be regretting that in 2-3 years. oh is it a good thing now? it also means they have to pay him his weekly wage forever? He's coming for LeBron's crown of being teammates with his son. Their gonna have a mini dynasty of Cole Palmers over there at Chelsea I mean.. there is also no June 31. It‚Äôs June of 2033‚Ä¶ I'd imagine they're gambling on the value of these players increasing regardless of their performance.   There's some merit to it. Liverpool signed Carvalho in 2022 for under ¬£8m, he has had two loans (one disaster in Germany and one good one in Championship) and a really poor half season for Liverpool and he just got sold for ¬£25m to Brentford.  Chelsea's problem may end up being that they've gone too far with it and will have a squad with zero experience or leadership, all on multi-year deals. Could go toxic super quick! I dont want to bore you with economic theory but there is a school of thought that believes the inflationary pressure in market and especially football means that regardless of player value, their resale value will go up faster than the inflation of the market will.  It's more along the lines of, ""I could put ¬£10m in the bank today for 3% interest, or I could put it in a player for 3% theoretical interest (market inflation), and if the player does well, sell for 300% profit""  I'm sure there is a risk analysis baked into it as well. Many variables actually, but assume the department did it's research first.   Whether this is trully the case at Chelsea, I don't know. End of the day, never underestimate the human stupidity. People keep overlooking how much our wage bill has shrunk and the new style contracts bar the length of them.  Lower base salary, incentivised bonuses, pay rises for those who peform. Palmer had his wages doubled this year with the new contract as a reward, he's still only on ¬£125K.  It's also why we are trying to shift old style contracts on i.e. Sterling.  Player who don't perform well will still be on a lower salary, so clubs will be more likely to buy them than say a Sterling on ¬£325K and the length of the contract/lower salary helps with getting a decent fee still.  This the thinking behind it anyway - whether it works out long term we'll see. The academy is also being used for pure profit which is frustrating. I think buy with a view towards the on paper value of the player increasing, making it a good investment. They are run by private equity people. It's not like Man City where the goal is to spend money to gain success on the pitch. These people are in the habit of spending money to make money. Success on the pitch is helpful for these sorts of owners in realising their objectives, yes, and may come but it's not the main focus.  They think they know something the rest of Europe doesn't, but it's not necessarily about winning first and foremost. Rightly or wrongly the American owenership believe European football is undervalued and will be subject to a degree of inflation.  These contracts now give you more control if this does happen. As well as value increases as players in theory play more and grow.   Now it‚Äôs certainly debatable if this will occur. We‚Äôve seen broadcast deals stagnate even mildly deflate in some markets. PSR and new squad costs may curtail wage growth as well. Outside of mudryk I think most of the guys were already either pretty close to top level or already playing there while being young.   So they are betting injuries won't hamper them.   The benefit of such long contracts is you can amortise them over the maximum allowed but also the wages aspect.   With wages you have a situation where the top earners can only get there by performing at Chelsea and keeping wages low means selling later becomes slightly easier too.   Not sure it's gonna work to be honest.  I think you will run into problems where you get a lot of chaff you can't move like mudryk and badiashelle and then quality players where you need to give them more wages so they don't get shitty and ask for a transfer anyway. It was the trick to comply to financial fair play. It was more a bookkeeping thing, than anything else well west ham have started it and i havent heard a peep from the media. What? It's about amortization  FFP is all about annual costs, you can pay 100 mill for a player but if his contract is 9 years and he's on 6 million a year that costs you 17 million this year. You move him in a year or two for 60% of the price and you virtually lost nothing in the eyes of FFP If it works in Football Manager.... I think giving out much longer contracts allows them to pay lower wages and if performances are good they then reward the player with an extension and a wage increase. This in theory is smart for two reasons: a) the player is being paid less per year than he otherwise would be, which on it's own has obvious benefits regardless of whether his performance is good or bad, b) it makes it much much easier to sell the player down the line if it ever comes to that (aka at Arsenal there's a consensus that Reiss Nelson is on anywhere between 80-120k a week which is a fortune for a sporadic rotational player and is said to be a big reason as to why he hasn't been sold yet... if he was on, say, 50k it'll be much easier to agree personal terms). I think it's telling that you have clubs like Athletic giving out these long contracts, considering how valuable their assets are to them and how scarce their market is compared to the rest of La Liga... essentially this safeguards them from being pickpocketed in the market, as they have full confidence in the quality of their players.  Of course if the player underperforms (hence nullifying any significant transfer interest) or straight up refuses to move I guess that's where the risk lies, but I'm sure that 9 times out of 10 it works itself out if the player has any market whatsoever. For a top class player like Palmer this is a blinder of a move from a Chelsea perspective, that simply doesn't happen pretty much anywhere else in Europe. At Arsenal, for example, we're giving substantial wage increases for 5 (or even 4) year contracts, which means we'll be forced to renegotiate another renewal in 2-3 years or risk losing the player for free.  This is all in theory, of course. You never actually know irl how this will pan out exactly. I thought a big part of their strategy was that they could split the transfer fee across the entire contract so that it has less of an impact of FFP regulations.   $100M over five years: $20M per year. Over ten years, half that.   Plus, knowing that transfer fees go down when the player is approaching the end of their contract‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt happen as often if the contract is super long. It was to get around player amortisation. By having such a long term contract you spread the transfer fee over 10 years instead of 5.   FIFA have clamped down on it and capped it at five years now, although I think the ones signed pre rule change don't count. Given how high football inflation rate is, the players' current wages will look low in 7 years time and Chelsea will be heralded as financial genius 7 years later. Chelsea has already proven everybody wrong with their academy players buying spree. Chelsea bought so many promising young players. Few made it to first team superstars but see how much transfer fee profit they generated. There is a graph showing that chelsea academy generate more transfee than many other premiership clubs It's done for Financial fair play/PSR rules Perhaps how to sell players well, but are they happy to just be a circus show generating money, or would they be happy with mediocrity on the pitch? Never go full Boehly Garnacho isn't even on the list? Best you can achieve is 8...5 year contact with 3 year option time to dl the editor That one is the most baffling for me honestly. Barca felt they needed to sign a player that potentially could rival Endrick purely for optics, and gave him a ridiculously long contact for amortization of the transfer sum.   But they didn't have any plan what do do with him once they signed him. They didn't plan to fit him in or loan him out, it is like they didn't have a clue about his skill level or ability and how to develop him into a player they could use eventually. Poor kid was stuck in limbo until his Betis loan. that was lazy scouting on their part. Arsenal spent months negotiating and Mudryk was shamelessly twerking for them. Boehly probably thought ‚Äúwell if Arteta and Edu are pushing for the player it means he‚Äôs generational‚Äù *then proceeded to offer ‚Ç¨20/30M more* with no plan whatsoever to get the player settled in.   maybe now he‚Äôs showing to be limited but I think he could have been better off by going to Arsenal and playing off the bench to ESR and Martinelli. Sometimes I wonder if you guys ever saw Mudryk play. His technique, his speed an acceleration is insane. Yes, he has bad decision-making but that is something that can be improved. I'm not saying this makes the money spent for him completely reasonable, I'm just saying he is nowhere near the waste of money people make him out to be. Almost like there's method to the madness but people are only focusing on the negatives Didn't know we were selling him it's a loan Bilbao don't have much options , and they don't sign a lot of players , so yes it is actually that. The Difference is fairly obvious no? Bilbao is limiting themselves to Basque players so its pretty easy to understand why they would want to lock the best ones up for 8 years because there arent that many of them to begin with, there are gonna be dozens of Mudryk tier wingers though so its weird to give that dude a lifetime contract Surely a football fan would be aware of the difference between how the two operate when signing players I have no doubt he would release the hounds on the bomb squad Per year, yes They need another manager for the 20 players they've frozen out Come on now, surely in 6 years? They've got FM players to go through first. could u get the best out of him? The site is so shite. They have fantastic database but every corner of it is covered in ads and auto-play videos. I have an adblocker but still stay away from it. I've been seeing more of that accept or fuck off practice lately > It's illegal  Is it ? There are soooo many websites like them, doesn't make them right but it's weird to get so worked up only at them even if this post uses them as the source.  You still have a choice not to use the site, plus many have proven that the data there isn't that accurate. You can give a player a contract for as long as you want, but you can only amortize their purchase over five years for PSR. For FFP purposes you amortize the fee over the length of the contract to a maximum of five years. So a club can give a player a longer than five year contract giving them more control of the player than a short contract, but not the accounting benefit for FFP purposes. Boehly has explained it that if you give a 5 year contract, in 3 years you have re-negotiate the contract, if not, you start to lose the value of the asset. So it's either a new contract or getting sold. If you have a 7 year contract, that happens only after 5 years.  An example of this would be Hazard - he signed for the club in 2012, they re-negotiated a new contract in 2015 that ran until 2020. With the new system if they would have given him a 7 year contract instead, in 2019 when Real was looking to buy him, his value would be even higher, as there would be more years left on his contract.  Hence the new Palmer extension. As it's a 9 year contract the club has control for the next 7 years. If they would have given the usual 5 year contract, in 3 years time his value would start to drop. Of course, there are downsides, but this is the benefit that they base it on. Because it was/is not just amoritisation. My understanding is that the longer contracts enable us to give lower wages (along with the incentivised bonus/reward structure i.e. see Palmer getting his wages doubled this year and he's still only on ¬£125K).   Lower wages doesn't just mean a lower cost to the club, it makes players easier to sell. Look at all the flops on big wages clubs struggle to sell (Lakaka). It's also why the club has been so aggressive getting rid of players on contracts before they started this new apporach i.e. Sterling and Chilwell currently and nearly all of the UCL winning team.   **Tangent:** Was a big reason why the Mount negotiations went south. Reece was on an old style contract and big money and Mason wanted the same, at one point a deal was close and then the new sporting directors came in and it was pulled from the table.  The longer contract length gives the players more security to compensate for the lower wages and it also helps retain some of their value when selling them on alongside the lower wages allowing clubs to spend a bit on the transfer fee. You have under contract as many players as Athletic has available in the world to hire. You should tell them their model does't work because \*checks notes\* jMS\_44 has a better idea Danish goalkeeper, signed by Chelsea from Villarreal not that long ago. Think it‚Äôs one of the new stable of goalkeepers, but admittedly it‚Äôs hard to keep em all straight. Villareals number 1 from last year signed by Chelsea Rotation option for Sanchez, apparently the club want rid of Petrovic Well for a start and career changing injury could occur and he has protected his income for near a decade. There was once a time Dele Ali looked like he would be a big name player then he dropped off the map, you never know what will change in personal circumstances that will effect on field performance. He possibly has performance related wage increases in his contract as well  I definitely feel he has the better side of the deal Fundamentally, the advantage is generally with the players, if the players want to reneg or at the worst throw a bitch fit and they are really worth a new amount, the club would usually cave. Basically, they can hold themselves hostage, what‚Äôs the club gonna do, shoot their own investments?   This while also having your long terms assurances covered. because he wasnt guaranteed to perform at this level. It must be incredibly difficult to move to a completely new team with new management and hit the ground running immediately. We've significantly lowered our wage bill - most people don't know or overlook that detail. It's a big reason likely why Chilly and Sterling will be sold - they are on the old style contracts before the new sporting directors came in. New contracts are lower base salary with a ton of incentives baked in and they are rewarding players who perform will with salary bumps. See Palmer whose wages were doubled but he's still only on ¬£125K roughly.   Biggest issue with selling players tends to be their wages i.e. whose going to pay Sterling's ¬£325K a week? Makes it harder to sell players. Despite us having all these players on long contracts, they'll be on relatively low wages unless they perform well in which case it's a good transfer for us.   I hate the strategy from a human standpoint but people are grossly misunderstanding it. Whether you agree with it or not, the club are following their strategy well at the moment. Big cost has been the forcing out of Acadmey players. I REALLY hope he can stay healthy. When a club buys a player the transfer fee is not recorded as a one time expense, but spread across the length of player's contract.  If you bought someone for 5 years @ 20m, you show a 4m/yr expenditure hit in your accounts.  While if you bought them for 10 years @ 20m, its 2m/yr. Note that this doesn't have anything to do with the actual payment of 20m transfer fee. The selling club receiving 20m instantly is not a foregone conclusion. It depends on whether the clubs agreed a lump sum payment or instalments. Also this cashflow won't directly affect the ammortization.   By spreading the transfer fee over a longer contract, clubs can manage their financial statements to compy with FFP limits. Selling club never receives 20m instantly, unless it was a release clause. There is always a payment structure. It‚Äôs very common for businesses to amortise costs. That‚Äôs creative accounting, not marketing. Because those are all tied. Common way to represent ties. IA was on the kit for a few preseason games If June 33 ever comes It‚Äôs alright he‚Äôs a known mouth breather Extremely unlikely. The owners have too much money, and they're currently only restrained by FFP.  Additionally, when Roman sold the club he put a clause in that we can't be loaded with debt and owners can't sell either for 10 years. So BlueCo is in it for the long term. ""Well we don't pay Barto era wages now so if he flops we'll sell for whatever teams are willing to pay, and if he doesn't want to leave he can be a reserve. Don't see the FDJ united fiasco happening here at all.""  A reply to your comment. Aged like a turd on a warm sunny day. When it stops being funny, meaning when Chelsea starts clicking Meanwhile chelsea fans are reposting the same infographic about their sales for the ~~tenth~~ multiple times this week.  Edit: A chelsea fan doesnt know what exaggeration is and is furious One of these contracts was signed like 2 days ago and another one last week... Think he was great under Lopetegui but dropped off slightly after he left Wolves, was still an overpay by West Ham but he looked good in their opening game, night and day over Zouma No. No, he was just bought when he peaked with Wolves. He could become a very reliable and useful defender in time though, he isnt exactly a failure. No he wasn‚Äôt sold Apparently he‚Äôs on 90k per week which is also what he was making at Man U. Takes him to 32 years old when the contract expires not bad I think. Maybe not. I mean West Ham haven‚Äôt played a style he‚Äôd struggle with since Pellegrini and that went really badly for them. He‚Äôs not injured crazily often and he doesn‚Äôt tend to have bad spells of form, he just didn‚Äôt do what we wanted him to. If West Ham stay somewhere between European football and relegation (which is basically their default state) then he should do fine. Yeah his game relies on pace so once he slows down he will suffer for it. I mean it‚Äôs good for him? Just sell him when he‚Äôs 40 Until June 34th, 30686 AC It'll be structured to have pre agreed raises. Probably a good bonus system. Won't be long till they follow the Dodgers lead and pay someone money for years after their playing contract expires Gonna make him play till he is 90 Thanks Plato Because there totally is a 32nd of June and a 31st of June. You just don't get jokes r/woooosh That only works if you buy the player cheap in the first place. 5m(its only 8m with add ons) for a 19 year old already proven in the championship is an absolute bargain that there was pretty much no where for his fee to go but up even if he never became good enough for them. I think buy low sell high only works if you do the first bit though   If Liverpool had paid 30m for Carvalho it wouldn't look such good business, and that's what Chelsea are doing Carvalho was not even under contract when Liverpool bought him - they agreed on a price only to avoid tribunal setting a price for him. Buying players in opportunistic situations (contract running out or low release clause) even if you dont need them is not new. It's hard to imagine them making a profit on Enzo, Caicedo or Mudryk but who knows what will happen over the next eight years There are many counterexamples to that. Also, this inflation is mostly in the PL. Chelsea has so many players that I struggle to see how they can sell them all to other PL clubs. So Chelsea football club becomes an investment vehicle eh.  Fine by me. >There's some merit to it. Liverpool signed Carvalho in 2022 for under ¬£8m, he has had two loans (one disaster in Germany and one good one in Championship) and a really poor half season for Liverpool and he just got sold for ¬£25m to Brentford.  OK thats actually interesting. Maybe Chelsea are geniuses then. Gambling for sure‚Ä¶won‚Äôt be as much value if they can‚Äôt even see the field We paid a fee to Fulham for carvalho via tribunal. Wasn‚Äôt an actual fee. We would have had to pay more, we got forced to pay the maximum fee doesnt make sense when you extend those contracts and increase wages though. I reckon Chelsea is modelling player resell price for specific type of players/players with specific attributes. The players' price being pretty unidirectional it's not a stupid idea.   As soon as we start winning trophies, that will just accelerate the price curbs. > zero experience or leadership  the ownership don't see that as an issue, winning is not important Part of the strategy most likely is that if a player is to be sold after a few years, a large portion of the purchase price has been amortized and these contracts are easier to offload because they are generally on lower wages. Mudryk on 100k a week could be affordable for a mid table PL team in 2-3 years given rampant wage inflation in English football. Jackson on ¬£65k, Veiga ¬£25k. These contracts could be very attractive in a few years since you have a player locked in for 3-4 more years on good terms. So they either work out for Chelsea or can be offloaded without too much pain after a few years. Yeah it will work out if the value of the football industry continues to increase, year after year. Even players whose ability to play decline might still be worth more in that situation. The relatively low wages they are on will help too.  Of course there are many assumptions built into that plan... Carvalho was worth more than ¬£8m when they brought him + small Liverpool tax. Yea of course hoping player value increases but also lower wages with long contracts makes it so wages don‚Äôt hinder selling much while the club have contract security since the deals are so long. But Carvalho's value didn't go up regardless of performance. It went up because he had a good loan in the Championship. Chelsea have 15-20 players who will either rot in the reserves or hope to have a good loan spell somewhere else, but they were also all purchased for at least 20 mil. So it doesn't seem clear to me that their values will go up. I think they'll take a bath on a lot of those players. It might just be normal lol. People are so dramatic about it just because it's not common, but there is zero rational argument that 7 is innately so much worse than 5 or 6. Just as when 6 was the max, I didn't see anybody crying that it's so much worse than 3. Did anybody stop and ask if 3 would not be better scientifically? It's just guessing that if something is a bit outside the norm then it's crazy. It might be just kinda the same really.  Madrid gives 6 years to Camavinga, Endrick, Bellingham, Valverde, Guler, Tchouameni - I never see it mentioned at all. 6 is totally nothing, and 7 is totally insane. Like, is there really a reason to think this is SUCH a big difference that it has to bury the club lol. That really 6 is completely normal and 7 is just such a crazy thing suddenly.  The main reason is surely financial, Chelsea was able to rebuild a full football team squad in two years, and fill it with players who are young and - in their opinion at least - will be good. That was financially possible thanks to this ""trick"".   I feel the meaning of it to the sports project is vastly exaggerated just because it's a cool number and anyone can comment on it. ""Oh no, the number is bigger than the other number! As an expert, I see stuff going wrong!"". But 99%, the key part is just gonna be signing players who do well. If players do well on loan like Salah or De Bruyne etc., then the difference in their contracts is not that big of an impact to anyone really. It'd be mostly a gain to Chelsea as they did lose some good players to free agency in the recent past. Meanwhile if they sign players who will do shittily, then really, 5 years or 7 years is not the most important part then too... Liverpool do a very good job of making it seem like they plan to keep and even use these players though.   Chelsea go out and announce they are dead wood and they don't want half the squad¬† He didn't have a poor half season at Liverpool I don't think. Isn‚Äôt this also due to FFP? IIRC purchases are written off over the entire duration of the contract financially. With inflation, that will make the impact of each purchase smaller the longer the contract. It‚Äôs hard to see how players values will increase when they aren‚Äôt getting game time. If you‚Äôre not in the shop window and unhappy with your place in the squad, you are going to be agitating for a move and prices will be set accordingly. No-one is going to over pay for a player that doesn‚Äôt play. You are also overlooking the new salary structure at Chelsea. TLDR: Players who don't perform well will stay on their relatively low base salaries making them easier to sell on. Except football inflation is a good thing for Chelsea considering the long term amortisation costs. This is the most obvious and factually substantiated answer  But this gets 4 upvotes while half-baked theories about ""football inflation"" rising faster than ""market inflation"" get 10x that amount.  It's impossible to tell if Chelsea have a specific market thesis on football. But we can tell they are restructuring their wage bill and squad by reducing average wages and lowering squad age with these deals. Longer contracts give both the club and player a tradeoff- club pays less and amortizes the fees over more years, player gets long-term security.  And if Chelsea are counting on long-term trends in the market, Id bet theyre counting more on *wages* increasing over time rather than their player values increasing over time. Wages have grown astronomically. By locking players into lower wages for 5+ years, deals like Palmer's will look good by 2026. If one of those players got injured, couldn't be sold and ran out their 7 year contract wouldn't that already negate almost any potential profit? (Not to mention the ludicrous fees they paid for a few of them) I could see a world where there‚Äôs more than just the one player kicking off about things that you usually see tbh. It‚Äôs all well and good talking about performance based wages but if your whole club is tied down to shitty pay in 3 years, but you‚Äôve only actually got a handful of players with any quality, what happens if those players realise their collective bargaining power? It‚Äôs not like the kids or 8 goalkeepers they‚Äôve signed can fill in for them, ultimately as many Chelsea fans have said the squad is really only the usual 25 or so players. I‚Äôd argue they don‚Äôt actually have all that much quality for all the money they‚Äôve spent, and so could be in real trouble if Palmer, Caicedo, Fernandez etc sat down and demanded to leave or a payrise. Not really, we are still doing it after the loophole was closed. We're still doing after the ""loophole"" was closed as others have said but a point most people are missing: The new owners (whether you agree with how they done it or not) have culled most of the old big money contracts (hence trying to shift Sterling on despite him being better than Mudryk) in favour of longer contracts with lower wages but an incentivised bonus structure.   Hence Palmer getting his wages doubled and still only being on something like ¬£125K.  The lower wages make players easier to shift i.e. see Lukaku or other big wage players clubs can't seem to sell, and the longer contract helps maintain the value because West Ham are already well established to be terribly run, spent less money, did it with less players, and are a generally less relevant club than Chelsea.  don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôve been reported on more for no good reason. We're doing it for a few players that are 1st team guaranteed I understand that. But Remember, you may not lose in the eyes of FFP, but you do lose the money. We are still giving out contracts 7+ years despite that amoritisation rule being limited to 5 years now. Cheers Geoff No it‚Äôs not, that‚Äôs the point. If it was then why isn‚Äôt anybody else doing these big brained moves to get around FFP and PSR? It really isn‚Äôt but if you‚Äôre still touting that drivel here today, then you‚Äôre probably not going to change your mind regardless. I know that. Its just weird that other teams somehow didn't think of this. Rival Endrick for optics is wild. Vitor Roque was very successful in Brazil and Barca needs a young striker.¬† >Barca felt they needed to sign a player that potentially could rival Endrick purely for optics, and gave him a ridiculously long contact for amortization of the transfer sum.   People keep parading this nonsense as if he wasn't one of the hottest prospect in Brazil. At least RM used them on their B team to ease them in, and even with Reinier sent him in a couple of (mostly failed) loans. Roque is just frozen at Barca. He was better than endrick when we signed him.  I hate this endrick PR man, what has he done to get this type of praise. Lewy is great but he's old, can't play every game so striker was 100% a position of need. Roque was supposed to be promising and he was only supposed to play backup until lewy retired. It was a logical transfer had the scouts been correct that he was talented. Shakhtars ceo said it was the exact same fee as arsenal that we offered, just more reasonable add ons. Don't know where you're getting those figures from Thanks for the misinformation. You didn‚Äôt even try to look it up before writing crap. They offered the same total deal. Arsenals addons were just harder to activate as they had ballon dor clauses. Whereas Chelsea had premier league and champions league clauses. It‚Äôs not lazy scouting if two teams have been going for the same player. Do you really think a club goes after players because another club is going after that same player? We saw multiple clubs fight over kudus and todibo, do you think all those clubs were just following the other teams? Ridiculous statement. > then proceeded to offer ‚Ç¨20/30M more  Where are you getting this from? It was reported we offered the same but with more achievable add-ons. It's already a bad deal, you don't need to make shit up. i think he would have looked like even more of a donkey playing for this disciplined arsenal team with a clear identity and intelligent players in every position Mudryk would have smashed it at Arsenal imo, would have been a different player. Chelsea situation was like the worst conditions to move in to. Boehly was not involved in the Mudryk transfer, that was Behdad Eghbali and Paul Winstanley. Rich to think a moron like Boehly even knew who Edu and Arteta were at that stage. He probably overheard a rival wanted him and tried to show his big American balls bad decision-making is absolutely not easy to improve lmao  might be the number one killer of otherwise pretty talented and skilled players. if you can't think fast enough to keep up you're just dead in the water > but that is something that can be improved  Adama Traore begs to differ Its very difficult to improve a player's intelligence and instinct. It requires an incredibly regimented system with plays being worked on to the point it becomes second nature in training.  Its an incredibly difficult thing to do, especially given the time coaches have been given. Without it youve just got Johnathan Biabiany. In fact, ""decision making"" is one of the hardest football skills to improve. By and large, you are either born with a high level of intelligence, or you're not. It cannot be learnt. nah he's shit. im sorry but theres no getting around it, he turned out to be so much worse than the hype made him out to be. hes not even a premier league standard player, which is fine, not everyone is good enough We are not selling him its a normal loan for a season (possibly two) I feel like this is one of those jokes that could become true though Want to list all 20 there mate? Depends if he doesn't mind taking instruction while I'm on my 5th beer and covered in crisps. That should have been an easy one for you to get. Look at the flair they have. Obviously, they're making a joke Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's the joke flying over your head... And yet we still start the salmon instead. > I definitely feel he has the better side of the deal  Not saying that Palmer is hard done by, although 130k isn't a huge salary for a player of his quality and potential, it being guaranteed for so long is definitely a huge advantage.  But these long contracts are in the best interest of the clubs, not the players. They are only really advantageous for mediocre depth players at their peak, so they can get long term financial security. You can be sure that the club's bean counters have gone over the numbers, this strategy didn't happen overnight by mistake.   Amortization aside, nailing down players for a relatively low salary and having a massive advantage in transfer negotiations will offset any risk of players being injured long term. Even when a different manager comes in, the player has a falling out or he doesn't fit in future tactics Chelsea can just loan him out or let him train with the reserves for a year without the risk of him forcing his way out or running down his contract and leaving on a free. It will be much harder for a player to leave a club. That makes sense. Thank you He has the better side of the deal if he doesn‚Äôt rate himself and looks at the more negative aspects of the sport.   However, in four years time he kicks on and is capable to going to a club like Real Madrid or simply wants out for whatever reason. He has no leverage whatsoever in which case Chelsea benefit. Do players really think that way?  I may get injured or start playing shit. I would have thought to make it at the top of the game you need a fair bit of self confidence. It just depends how his career goes. Ali‚Äôs teammate Kane had the opposite problem, no way he could leave. I think it's a good way to think, but it all hinges on whether they stay healthy / a good footballer for that long. Is there anything stopping a player from dropping off and just collecting the paychecks for the next 7 years? The problem I see with that strategy is you can only ever buy young talent that doesn‚Äôt have other offers for better pay. That might be fine, but it does mean you‚Äôre always gonna lack both experience and proven ability in any new signings. From a football point of view that feels like it would cause issues, but maybe if you can stay ahead of your needs, and grow experience into the squad you can still get on fine. There‚Äôs also the option of arbitrarily breaking that policy, but the indication seems to be they don‚Äôt wanna do that or they‚Äôd be keeping the likes or Sterling. >Dude he has more goalss than alvarez had at his age playing in better league and some number of goals now despite missing 2 months:D People writing this comments never seen him play.  This one is also quite funny But when they start clicking they'll just sack their manager again and start another rebuild. I mean, who else is going to do it but us? Positive Chelsea thing gets reposted a few times = >:(  Negative and sometimes untrue Chelsea thing gets repeated in every single comment section = xDDD Oh perhaps you can post a link to what you are talking about Tenth time? In recent times, it's been posted by Chelsea fans twice. The other from a Leeds fan. He was born on 26 November 1997. If the contracts expires on the 30th of June 2031, he will be 33 years old (going 34) Wouldn't he be 33 then? He's 26 now and the contract expires in 7 years. Honestly good deal for everyone involved, hope he shines for yall. Basically securing the same money for a longer period while still playing for a (slightly less) competitive side. It also gives you a bit more flexibility having a homegrown player locked in for 7 years, especially in the post-brexit era. He's gonna be so good for you guys though I guarantee the fans are gonna love him. It takes him to 33 and 7 months, he basically has a contract for the rest of his career. (Born late Nov. 1997.) With the stupendous inflation of player wages, signing a player of his standing at ¬£90k a week is a bargain, never mind it being for half a dozen years.  Chelsea are desperate to get rid of Steriling who earns over ¬£300k per week and won;t even play for them - it's madness. Wait? He isn't already 30? AWB is not fast, but yeah I'm not sure his body is up for those lunges when he is well into his 30s Not pace exactly, but physicality in some sense, for sure.   I think the biggest problem that West Ham will realize quickly is that he‚Äôs not actually a good defender. He‚Äôs a fantastic 1v1 tackler, sure ‚Äî if his entire job was to run around the field tackling wingers, he‚Äôd do great.   But he has no positional sense, no strength, and a poor header. So he‚Äôs often exposed at the back post and at the front post.   He‚Äôs quite good at keeping the ball, but not good at doing something with it. So he‚Äôs good for a side that wants to control the game, but not as any type of creative outlet. To who Ben? Fucking southend?? Till 90 pssst To Arsenal? AC stands for After Cole Thats a lot of amps Mets did it first Only if your objective is to make big profits.   Chelsea‚Äôs owners are willing to inject cash for player purchases meaning that they only really need to break even on sales from a book value point of view to carry on this strategy.   As another user has pointed out in 3 years time Caicedo needs to be sold for 50m in order for him to not dent their books and conform to the regs. That is very possible. Couple that with their sales of homegrown talent which are booked at 100% profit and it suggests that this approach is more sustainable than people give it credit for, albeit a lot riskier than other clubs are willing to go. We also wouldn‚Äôt get the fee we got for Carvalho if he were under contract the next 6/7 years as well because 30m in 5 years time will probably be a lot less money with inflation. I think it's clear that there's 2 types for the contracts. Plans to develop and keep, and plans to develop and flip. Those 3 are probably in the develop and keep bracket, based off investment fee for each. Meanwhile others under 20m mark are probably in the develop and flip, unless they exceed expectations and get moved to the other bracket The only thing that really matters in this context is making a profit on the remaining book value, rather than the original price we paid. I could see that happening with the vast majority of players we‚Äôve signed Are you kidding me? Murdryk and Antony are practically this generations Messi and Ronaldo! I'm not advocating for the strategy, it's just a guess as to what they could be at.  I still think it's mental btw. Every top club is an investment vehicle. I mean, this is more liverpools strategy of buying the best 15/16 year olds playing in the country, developing them and if they are good enough they play if not we sell them on.   We did this again today with selling Bobby Clark, who we got from Newcastle for 1.5m and sold him 3 years later for 10m.   This window we got Rio Ngumoha from Chelsea. In 3 years' time, he will likely be worth at least 10m, but he could be worth much more. Carvalho was opportunistic buy (his contract ran out with Fulham and price was agreed so they avoid tribunal setting a price). Liverpool did not pay ""full price"" (full price would be 3+ year left on his deal or something), while Chelsea are paying ""full price"" and oftentimes above that Players who don't perform well aren't going to be that attractive to buyers though? But Chelsea will still lose money on net when they sell them. (Talking about purchase price - sale price, not book value at the time they leave the club.) Palmers deal will probably look good in 2026. But they'll also have 3+ flops they can't play who they have to keep paying for years. except if they become trash, no one's gonna buy them and you'll be hard stuck paying fees for nothing. Basically a fixed cost, high risk, low reward  It's like if I inherited 700k from nana and I put it all into INTC stocks, that'd be unheard of Sure, they're paying lower wages, but on net they're still going to lose money for a lot of players they purchased, since very few of them were less than like 20 mil. So they'll have paid on-average lower wages for about 50 players for several years, and then struggle to break even on most of them. Players values don't go up automatically over time. Aye, it's finance bro thinks they've solved football stuff. The same thing happened at United, they extended Phil Jones contract to 'preserve his value' on paper. You saw he just got injured, drew a wage without playing and eventually left. Maybe the asset on the balance sheet inflates the apparent value of the club on paper but a players actual value when you try to realise it is only high if they are playing and playing to a high standard. They‚Äôve also gone for lower fixed wage contracts that are heavy on match day incentives and performance clauses. It mitigates the risk. After that they believe the benefits outweigh the risks, simple as that. It still doesn't really make sense though. Sure, you have lower wages but you're also writing off 5-15 million a year on some of these players. The total cost is probably similar to just keeping the older player on a high contract who was already written off or attained for a lower transfer fee. Total cost for guys who came through your youth program are even lower because they don't have any amortization losses. It's basically a huge gamble on future transfer values. Long contracts are bad because you won previously and have spent money!  Compelling argument. Players are an operating cost to clubs, no players no club. So you‚Äôre not ‚Äúlosing‚Äù money per say. Clubs like Chelsea have huge yearly revenues to pay for these operating costs sure but neither you nor I nor any Chelsea fans nor any non-Chelsea fans are affected by the owner losing money That ""loophole"" was patched so it is not relevant anymore. But even before it was patched it was simply a bad move, which is why no other team did it - but it was still a way around FFP in short term, nobody said it was a good one. In addition they probably think it is a good idea to tie players down for that long, which is why they are still doing it. Please change my mind, I'm open to other points of view They need a Busquests replacement more. Xavi was crying out for one for the whole year. Once again, they‚Äôve been bailed out by La Masia with Bernal and Casado Then why didn't they play him at striker???? And why has their need for a young striker vanished 6 months later even though they didn't bring in a replacement? Honestly your rebuttal is more wild. I'm not saying I agree with OC but you didn't address any of their points You act like your club doesn't do dumb shit like this to justify such an opinion. It's not even that crazy of an idea considering how poorly Barca transfer strategy has been the last few years. I thought it was the same fee with more upfront from Chelsea. The narrative was a big part of their sale consideration was going toward relief fund for Ukraine war. Yeah thats how I remember as well, its not like Chelsea payed double what we were going to. Maybe we dodged a bullet, but also would be interesting to see how he could have developed under Arteta. Definitely could be the same result, but interesting to consider Curious - is he close to reaching any of those add-ons? Those figures come from exactly the same place Chelsea haters cope from: their asshole I don‚Äôt recall reading that. I can be mistaken in the numbers then. I don‚Äôt actually recall Arsenal being available to offer a ‚Ç¨100M package for Mudryk.   but if that is indeed what happened, doesn‚Äôt take away that Chelsea was more opened to give more money than Arsenal regardless - after all, easier add ons were accepted for a reason. when were we ever agreeing to pay 70m euro base for mudryk? you offered a total of ‚Ç¨100M with addons. if I‚Äôm not mistaken Arsenal wasn‚Äôt going over ‚Ç¨80M according to rumours at the time.  the difference was between ‚Ç¨20M and ‚Ç¨30M. You can teach discipline to even the thickest, it's clear they're simply not bothering challenging these players at Chelsea beyond buying two more guys in their position Totally agree. Also when people say ""he just needs to improve his end product"" - oh .. you mean the main thing that separates good from great players?  I would take someone with good decision making but inferior physical attributes all day every day - for example Jota on our team. His brain is just operating at a higher refresh rate than those around him. When young players get into the senior squad and coaches get asked what they need to improve on, most of the time they say decision-making. Don't know if the Progress is easy but definitely not impossible Always exceptions to the rule It's hard to gauge what is intelligence and instinct versus the effects of being under pressure, under performing, and being desperate to score. You often see players having a shocker, blasting shots from all over the place, then once they get a coupe goals and a little run of form they kick on from there > Its very difficult to improve a player's intelligence and instinct.   I don't know where you would get that from at all.   In Milan, we've watched tons of players mature on the field just in the last few years. Leao stopped playing hero ball and starting making great passes into the box, now he's really good. Theo and Tonali both stopped losing their head heads and flirting with red cards as they matured into above average defenders. Saelemakers looked so much more in control with the ball at his feet the second half of the year at Bologna.   Players mature with age all the time. This is exactly what happens those guys who come out of nowhere in their mid 20s to have solid careers. That‚Äôs a name that I haven‚Äôt heard in a while vini and CR7 have improved a lot during their careers in this aspect What is this based on?  Most people can be pretty good chess players with concerted efforts at learning and practise; I think this applies to football too like most things. The trouble is when every other (football) player is grandmaster already, it's difficult to bridge that gap This is just dead wrong It was a sarcastic question 'we rotate players based on form, why shouldn't we rotate managers too?' - Boehly, probably. Making a joke about your manager's comments mate, no need to cry about it. He will thrive in that environment. But the joke doesn‚Äôt work with them because they literally have like 5 million people to select from, so they have to make sure they stay. > But these long contracts are in the best interest of the clubs, not the players.  They're in the best interest of the club and the player. That's why so many players are choosing to sign for Chelsea. Provided he keeps last seasons quality over the majority of the nine years. If there is a Dele style drop off this season or beyond, then he'll suddenly be extremely grateful for the additional 8 or so years of that contract.      Of course if last season is truly a sign of things to come from him, then yeah Chelsea have themselves a hell of a bargain and a ton of leverage if anyone comes in for him. How‚Äôs that funny? No one here saw him play¬† lol so true [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1exu1cj/transfermarket_chelsea_have_now_made_145m_from/) We're really at the point where chelsea fans are that seething they refuse to acknowledge what exageration is. He‚Äôs 32 until he‚Äôs 33 I'll miss him. He's going to be great for West Ham I don‚Äôt watch a ton of United but from what I have seen he reminds me a fair bit of Nathaniel Clyne Al Ronaldo Nice hbomber reference Southend are a great team what do you mean Haha zing! Bobby Bonilla day is one of the great American Holidays. No? Breaking even on book value may still carry a loss overall.  If I buy a player for 50m and amortize them over 5 years, and then in the final year i sell them for 40m, I didn‚Äôt actually make money from the sale. Its still a 10m loss in total and that‚Äôs before counting the players wages into account.  Its because those losses count in year 2, 3 and 4. Its not like they magically disappear. And over time and over many players, they add up a lot. It‚Äôs a mess and provides no stability. Look at how managed managers they‚Äôve gone through. 6? How on earth is that sustainable? At that rate they are gonna burn through managers quicker than players.¬† Inflation isn‚Äôt linear and if anything prices have gone down from the crazy days of the Neymar, Coutinho transfers. Seems very unlikely that 50m becomes the going rate for youth players after loan spells Maybe. The top 4 transfers were all from PSG or the trickle down of the Neymar transfer (Neymar, Mbappe, Coutinho, Dembele) so transfer prices haven‚Äôt really increased in 5 years. Is simply speculation of player growth. It‚Äôs so cynical and disgusting treating players like objects and assets. Ik it‚Äôs just the way modern football is but chelsea have taken it to another level Chelsea still have to recognize the annual amortization of their transfer fees. So a sale of one of these players may show a gain in the year, but a huge loss if you extend the time frame. If you buy someone for 100M on a 5 year contract and sell them in the last year for 25M, you still paid out 75M of depreciation that needs to be made up for.  It is part of the carrying cost of these assets.  Yes, you made 5M in the last year but every other year you were losing value. that's not how it works :D you need to fund the yearly depreciation from somewhere The most expensive player there is caicedo at ‚Ç¨116m amortized over 7 years, which means that selling him in 3 years the break even book value is ‚Ç¨50m  Wouldn't overlook that as a possibility  It's more the underperforming long contracts that could be issues.. when players ask to be paid out to leave None of the La Liga top clubs are privately owned.  Bayern too. Just to name a few.  Even Chelsea before ClearLake takeover wasn't an investment vehicle.  It was a financial blackhole. Sure within reason, it'll be a spectrum. There will be absolute duds along the way but take Mudyrk for example. I could see a club taking a 20-30 million gamble on him if he doesn't perform in the next season or two. We'd lose money but not as much if he was on twice the wage. It's true, but I guess there's a whole spectrum of buyers out there where 'not performing well *for Chelsea*' is still good enough for them. There will be a few but likely less than if we were paying them wages like we used to (see my previous comment on the new style contracts).   We can handle a dud or too, or taking a loss on delling players here and there consider how strong we are at selling too.¬† I don't think so, maybe 1 or 2 really bad flops.¬†   Like we might take a loss on selling some players but them being on lower wages helps us sell them a lot easier.¬†   Disasi for example is reportedly only on ¬£80K which is not a lot compared to other top clubs. Lisandro Martinez ¬£125K and Maguire ¬£190K from a quick Google (so a pinch of salt).¬† Transfer inflation is really well documented but I get what you are saying.¬†   If we break even or make a small loss on most of them that's fine. We only need a few big sales to balance it.¬†   Unfortunately the academy becomes fodder for profit. That's my biggest gripe with the strategy. It's happening to other clubs to being force to sell youth players but Chelsea are using it to fund their transfer strategy moreso rather than being 100% backed in a corner. I really hope the reality of it all hits Chelsea like a sack of bricks in 3-4 years but for now they're acting like every other club is behind and don't get their infinite money glitch of buying players way above market value and then magically selling them for more after a few years of loans or not playing at all). There were stories last week or maybe the week before that the average wage of the signings is something like 60k, so just over 3m on average a year, so while there's outliers I.e. Sterling most players are significantly below the top of end that range you mentioned. The combo of bonuses in contracts and longer contracts seems to have really helped them keep the wage figures down on these signings. It should if you actually care about your club. Money doesn't grow on trees, eventually it'll catch up. The EPL patched the loophole such that contracts cannot be amortized over a duration longer than 5 years regardless of contract length, yet Chelsea continues to give out longer and longer contracts. That alone should tell you that the motivation behind the long contracts is not PSR compliance.  Secondly, the owners have very openly stated that they believe long contracts on reasonable terms protect the value of the players. Flick approving the purchase of Olmo is the most baffling to me. Same up front, just more achievable add ons I'm not a Chelsea fan, and it was pretty well reported at the time that Arsenal and Chelsea had a similar package in total fee, just that Arsenals addons were things like balon dor clauses. How can you be so confident yet so wrong. Not arguing that. Though even with the easier add ons, I'm not sure too many were triggered so far based on his performances I think our highest bid was 80-90 million, and then the kroenkes were going to offer 100 something but Arteta didnt want to spend that much money so we got Trossard instead Nah it was pretty well reported at the time that both clubs ended up at the same total amount, but just that Arsenal's add-ons were a bit harder to reach (though Chelsea's still include things like winning the league).  Arsenal just got saved by Chelsea stupidly joining them and competing for his signing. Arsenal were also offering 70m + 30m in addons. The add-ons in Mudryk's contract with us include payouts for winning the Premier League and Champion's League.  Source: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4096686/2023/01/17/shakhtar-donetsk-ceo-why-mudryk-chelsea-not-arsenal/ nah not impossible but it's heavily context-dependant imo. chelsea is too chaotic and they're expected to play at a level he just isn't at right now. i think he would benefit a lot from playing in a slower paced league  salah comes to mind Confidence helps sooo much, but at the end of the day sometimes players have a hot month but end up returning to their old ways. As a Bayern fan, I've thought K. Coman turned the corner so many times through the years. Like surely now he's got an end product. But nope, he just has the occasional impressive run of games then goes back to braindead decision making in the final 3rd. Those are mindset things, not playing intelligence in my opinion. Theo and tonali were too quick to rile up and opponents knew it. Getting less angry as they grew up is a part of becoming mature. Same thing with leao. He in particular learned to use his team mates. It helped that your team became better so he didn't have to be the one man star.  I don't think mudryks problem is maturity. He doesn't make rash tackles or get provoked. He doesn't shoot from distance when he should cross or pass. He doesn't try to do everything by himself. Who is Biabiany? It's 100% possible. I see it less so with Ronaldo because it happened at united more than real. Ronaldo improved himself but reinventing himself.  Vini definitely, and it helps he's had such a stable environment. Chelsea is far from stable That final sentence is the killer. Going from a newbie to above average is do able, yeah. But the top 1% is different.  Mudryk has the potential to be a good player, a really good player. But let's be fair his game sense isn't ever going to be on the same level as someone like Robert Pires.  And to be challenging for the Premier league, that's the Elite level you need to be at, not just v.good . We're not talking about ""pretty good"". Obviously practise and learning will improve any skill, up to a certain level.  But we're talking about the 0.0000001%. The most elite footballers on the planet. And at that level, you can't simply ""learn"" your way to the top. You can't learn how to make the right decisions within the 1/10th of second you have on the Premier league pitch. You're either born with that ability or you're not. I'd say there are planty of exceptions. But there is some truth to the fact the some players it comes extremely naturally and others it continues to be their weakpoint throughout their careers. Let's see you learn your way into becoming Einstein then It wasnt even a question. ""I am working with one manager"" Boehly said. ""It's not a mess like it looks from outside. The other managers can even have 20 years contract, it is not my point. I don't care."" Which comment? It'd be funnier if it wasn't based on bollocks. The joke wasnt on athletic, the joke was on chelsea Ik it was exaggeration mate, I'm just correcting it coz it's not fun to see from a personal pov whether u care or not. Idk why u care so much u felt the need to comment this. Here we go. Again. You wont miss him with nous their. the way he wins that ball.... I suppose profit can be achieved in many ways.  You‚Äôd suspect Clearlake‚Äôs ultimate goal is driving up the valuation of the club and then selling that in years time for big profit. Like a few billion. Player profits generating a few Ms are schoolboy by comparison That really doesn‚Äôt matter when you have owners willing to inject cash and Chelsea do so the only thing that matters at the moment is the books. But the ‚Äúbook value‚Äù is actually what shows up that year when selling. Amortization helps with that and selling a player for 40m the last years out of a 5 year contract  you bought for 50m is actually a good thing.   Paying a players contract per year isn‚Äôt necessarily a loss, but part of the operating financials per year, just like wages. If they‚Äôre shit and ride the bench, then yes , but the wages and per year contract value arent what gets docked as a total ‚Äúloss‚Äù in that years financials since it‚Äôs already spread out through the contract entirety.  Yes ‚Äúoverall‚Äù you can say it‚Äôs a loss because 50-40. But per year you‚Äôre only paying 10m. That‚Äôs why clubs hold out for a players contract value remaining at the very least when selling. If you then sell below the contract value per year and wages, then that‚Äôs when it counts as a book loss. but it's a write off!  /s Tbf they‚Äôre not buying 50m players so theyre not rly losing that much money Yeah, football prices trend upwards but are in bubbles and the owners have created their own bubble of inflation when it comes to youth players. I highly doubt the trend upwards will overtake the bubble they've created themselves that means they're paying ¬£20m for players like Kellyman, DDF, Ugochukwu, Casadei etc. [Premier league spending has increased](https://www.insideworldfootball.com/app/uploads/2023/09/image004.png) and will likely continue to do so as it is gaining popularity in america and parts of asia. The average stock market return per year after adjustment for inflation is 7.5% - 10% based a 20 or 10 year average respectively. The premier league transfer spend looks to be increasing faster than that. European leagues are also getting more investment which will further drive the price of players. Honestly buying football players is a pretty good investment all things considered. It's been like this for decades, mid table teams of the top leagues and other non-top 4 teams used players as assets to flip for money when possible, Chelsea are just trying to buy in at a smaller price on the product chain.  And players have been using teams as stepping stones for all those years too, now it's on them to actually put the effort to make it at the bigger level, or stop trying because they reached their objective faster than expected.  What Chelsea is doing here is just putting math to the formula that already existed, loyalty and honor are a thing from way before in time. They're not treating players like assets. They're treating the exclusivity of those players to play with their club. Tbh it's kind of a bubble if they don't play, because they don't generate revenue (unless you count shirt sales....) its not great but we have no other revenue source currently. This seems to be what the academy players are for‚Ä¶ Well you could fund it by not buying anyone else but I doubt that‚Äôll happen. And you can find it by growing the club‚Äôs revenues. Finishing lower places in the league doesn‚Äôt help with that. I'm pretty sure the losses of the previous 3 years are included in the PSR so if 3 years the break even is ‚Ç¨50m book value they've already taken a bath on the ‚Ç¨66m in their books as depreciation losses. They sell for ‚Ç¨50m in 3 years they've lost big time,there will always be 3 years of depreciation to fight in the accounts, I am not sure Sky are covering that viewpoint. For PSR purposes most of Chelsea's signings are amortised over 5 years regardless of contract length. The PL changed the rules to address this ""loophole"". Who knows, but I think the theory falls down if the wage is twice as low but the contract is twice as long.¬†  I think Chelsea will be paying off a lot of these contracts for a lot of years.¬† It‚Äôs kinda funny that Chelsea is prob the biggest driver of transfer fee inflation right now, and they‚Äôll be relying on it to save their books. The problem with relying on transfer inflation is that sure, the value of a decent prem player prob goes up year on year, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can sell a dozen players who have been rotting on the bench for a year or two for basically anything.   Obviously not a Chelsea fan, but I‚Äôd argue that the other issue with the strategy of selling beloved homegrown players to fund asset speculation is that the new group really hasn‚Äôt shown themselves capable of scouting well. Many more big misses than passable hits so far in their signings, which doesn‚Äôt bode well for overall squad management. I think in that case they'll be fine, because they can probably sell the club, may already be planning to do that in a few years. Clearlake Capital made a ton of money by swooping in and buying up assets after the financial crash and selling them at a profit when the economy recovered. They may be able to make a healthy profit on Chelsea due to the circumstances around Abramovich being forced to sell if they have a plan to pump up the value of the club.  These people are portrayed as stupid because of how they are running Chelsea as a football club, but I think they probably aren't stupid when it comes to having a plan of leaving this experiment wealthier than they were when they started. What that means for Chelsea as a football club post-Clearlake or even in the present I don't know. But when the music stops I doubt it'll be any skin off their nose. The Glazers are similar. People pillory the Glazers for how they've run United down over the years, but they aren't stupid. They've made money out of their ownership beyond what you can imagine at the expense of the club itself. You don't need to win to profit. Okay, thanks for the information, didn't know that Don't understand why they even signed him. Talented and he's from La Masia, but they're already stacked at the 10. Pedri, Fermin, Torre, Gundogan (though he's leaving). Feels like Laporta trying to make a statement signing after failing to get Williams, who actually makes sense given that he mainly plays on the left and not at the 10, where Barca's best option is Ferran Torres. Not to mention that Olmo is very injury prone. You think Flick has any say in transfers? The add-ons I've heard was 5M euros every time Chelsea won the Premier League or Champions League until his contract expires.  What were Arsenal's add-ons then? The Arsenal wage offer was also reported to be half of what we were offering him    Edit:   >  ""The Independent has been told that Mudryk will be on over ¬£100,000 a week, with Arsenal having initially gone up to ¬£50,000 a week.""  https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-mykhailo-mudryk-transfer-arsenal-shakhtar-b2262535.html    Maybe what was reported changed after the fact, but that was what was reported at the time. I ain't making shit up unless you think I wrote articles for 20 different news sites. Not true, the Athletic reported that both teams offered 100m all in (70 + 30). Our add-ons involved winning the Premier League and Champion's League and were deemed more ""achievable"" so I'm guessing Arsenal either had some Balon d'Or clauses or multiple PL/CL wins required. Funny how they‚Äôve talked Chelsea ‚Äúoffering 100m for mudryk and 20m more than arsenal‚Äù without any source whatsoever saying that. Just talking bullshit for the sake of it Of course it can depend on the player, but I just don't think we've really seen enough of Mudryk and to my knowledge he's never had a run of games at Chelsea to be able to say whether he's just not that good or whether he has more to offer. At least Coman has played so many games that you know nothing is going to change now A really fast direct winger with very little end product. I remember him most from his days at Parma and for being a menace on some earlier Fifa games Now you got me You don't need to be Einstein though lol *comment sorry >Speaking in his press conference on Wednesday, he said: ‚ÄúI am not working with 42 players. I am working with 21 players. The other 15-20 players are training apart. I don't see them.  You have access to Google you tit. The joke wasn't on chelsea, the joke was on low iq upvote whores. Oh lmao, I thought the guy I replied to replied to the prior seaweed guy above, my bad >Ik it was exaggeration mate  I believe you.  >see from a personal pov whether u care or not  Not sure how you got that answer from my comment Alright Fab :)  Jokes aside, us originals are getting old together :( We kept dalot. If you think AWB has bad crossing you haven‚Äôt seen Dalot cross. have you seen the prices pl clubs go for? The midtable and lower level pl clubs go for around 100-300m in recent history.  AC Milan went for 1.2 billion and they‚Äôre a good example of the buy low and sell high strategy working, but this strategy only worked because the old owners essentially got the club on a free.  Clearlake bought chelsea for 4.25 billion. Maybe I‚Äôm just too stupid to see it but how in the world are they expected to sell for even higher than that? That fee is ludicrous when compared to what other clubs went for.  Ironically it feels like the same problem with their transfer strategy. They don‚Äôt know how to identify actual bargains and just assume their investments will always go up in price. That‚Äôs what a lot of people are missing. Clearlake don‚Äôt really give a shit about Chelsea‚Äôs long term future. It‚Äôs an investment, they‚Äôre just trying to drive up the value now so they can sell it. They‚Äôre still trying to succeed, a club in the CL and competing for major trophies is worth a lot more, but they‚Äôre not concerned with long term finances. If we‚Äôre operating on the assumption that they‚Äôre perfectly happy to dump money into chelsea without any result then sure but surely they want to make money at some point?  And so far, it‚Äôs not looking good. Having to resort to hotels and training ground sales and still struggling with psr suggests that they‚Äôre very far in the red. But if they are buying these players as assets that are expected to appreciate and be sold for a profit, which is what this strategy appears to be, book value means fuck all.  If they sell Caicedo for 60, books have amortised him down to 40, books will say it's a profit. In reality, they have paid him ¬£5m per year at least, and are down $40-50m on the transfer fee alone. That's upwards of 60 million pounds that have disappeared into the ether. Creative accounting doesn't make that a successful asset sale in real life, only in the eyes of FFP legislation. Why are significant operational costs in wages not considered a loss? Well sure, if you're only looking at that year's financials and ignore all previous and future years.  But that's not how it works in reality. Its not even how it works for PSR either as PSR looks at the past 3 years, not just the year you happen to be actually selling the player in. I think there's a difference between a ""midtable"" team buying potential to flip, and a top team doing so. Mainly the difference being that the top teams are aiming for titles etc. and often can't afford to play players with ""potential"" to give them game time and development ahead of the likely much more consistent/developed first team player in that position. Whereas a ""midtable"" team can give playtime to those players, as the potential for those players is likely higher than that of their ""starters"". But you can still do that with academy players without paying 20M for assorted talent all over the place. No, the contracts that were signed before that are still valid I believe the owners themselves can get a profit off of selling the club, but I don't think that Chelsea the club will earn a lot of money and if the fans don't care about their own clubs and prefer their owners get rich then fair play, they'll probably ruin a few more clubs on the way but as you said they don't care about the football or the fans, only cash. As part of the sale of the club the new owners are locked into something like min 10-11 years off the top of my head. It's not going to be a while until they look at moving on, but it seems more likely at that point it's a case of divestment and bringing more partners in than fully selling.   We're all discussing how its going in the short term, which obviously isn't great, no doubt but it's pretty clear that everything they're doing is with a much much longer timeframe in mind. Can play on both wings, can play as a second striker if need be, has much better work rate than any of the mentioned players and especially than Gundogan; overall just a perfect fit for Flick's system and even more so if played as a 10 but even as a left winger with overlapping Balde.   &nbsp;  Of course he's injury prone and that's an issue in itself but to question why Barcelona signed him is genuinely baffling to me as he fits perfectly. if he doesnt then Barca is a even more of a joke project I might be wrong but I don't think the structure of either team's proposed add-ons have been fully revealed, just that ours involved Champion's League / Premier League titles in some capacity. The same ones but Shakhtar know Arsenal won‚Äôt win Prem or UCL BigReeceJames don't talk out of your ass challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)  >Neither does it boil down to his salary. Mudryk will be earning around ¬£97,000 a week at Chelsea. Arsenal had been speaking to him since October, according to Shakhtar‚Äôs chief executive Sergei Palkin, and their contract offer was within ¬£10,000 per week of that eventually accepted across town.   Source: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4093504/2023/01/18/inside-mudryk-deal-chelsea-arsenal/ I guess i remember it wrong then mb Funny but not surprising, nor is it surprising that /r/soccer eats it up no questions asked. It‚Äôs also hilarious that he said that it was ‚Äúlazy scouting‚Äù by Todd Boehly, when in reality, he was not involved in his transfer. This reminded me that the only thing I remember about him is going back and forth between Inter and Parma. He's the French guy who played for Inter right?  I remember this guy is part of the downfall of the treble winning team Majority of those players weren't in the 1st team to begin with so they are hardly being frozen out. If you actually looked up that list of players (take your own advice) you'll see names like Tino Anjorin, Marcus Bentinelli, Broja, DD Fofana, Kellyman, George, Washington, Gilchrist etc.  Sure Sterling and Chilwell are being frozen out but not amost of them.  I get you're joking but the narrative is 1. wrong. 2. been beaten like a dead horse.  So yeah shit joke. Legit clicked show more comments to see it, I knew what it was and wanted to read it anyway lol Absolutely shocking take Pretty sure when the takeover was happening bohley came out in a business conference and said that they see Chelsea growing to be 10-15b range or something to that affect. The only argument I see(and I don‚Äôt agree with it) for drastically higher valuations is this:  EPL/top football clubs are very few and they loom large in a massive section of the world‚Äôs population.  Given this, compared to large corporations that are valued at 1-3trillion dollars then football clubs are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù vs the mindspace they occupy. (Not saying should be the same and I personally think clubs shouldn‚Äôt be privately owned.)  Just that a few billion is not what it used to be to these sickeningly rich people To add a bit of technical details which could be applicable.   The losses will materialise over time as you mentioned, taking point of departure in your previous comment to this one. This will reduce the equity through lower retained earnings. Further, if this is debt financed, the same will occur with regard to interest and fees on the financing (conversely revenue from merch., stadium grounds, etc. etc. will contribute positively of course).  If the club were to be sold as a share deal, meaning selling the legal entity (or entities) that comprise the Chelsea FC activities, a potential bid would probably be based on an Enterprise Value meant to value the operations, assets and activities.  Deduct from that any debt to be paid/settled and you have the net asset value (or equity) that would be sold. Meaning, if you have not driven up the value (or the perceived value) of the club and its activities more than the debt and losses incurred over time, you will have lost money on the investment.  In short, your perception is correct. From a cash flow perspective. Clearlake bought the club for 2.5 billion, the rest was meant as money that they had to use for the club and it's infrastructure for the next 10 years. MLS just sold the rights to start a team (with no players or assets included) for $500mm so it‚Äôs basically do you think Chelsea can be worth 20x more than that. I‚Äôve seen absolutely nothing to suggest that generating actual cash is their goal. That could be a long term goal (god knows why you‚Äôd chose a football club to do that IMO) but at the moment it seems to be about building a competitive* global football club.   *Their methods for this are somewhat confusing.   Selling infrastructure was probably something they always had in mind in order to pursue this heavy spend operation. But they‚Äôve pulled it off and so far avoided any FFP and PSR issues.   Just for the record I think what they‚Äôre doing is bizarre from an actual money point of view and like you said, I don‚Äôt understand what the ownership group are gaining from it yet. But as far as spend regulations go the way they‚Äôre doing things seems to hold up more than people say it does, so far. Well yes, but if you‚Äôre treating players as assets the accounting is really all that matters here and is my point. Because you can technically, as you mentioned, still make profit selling a player below the value you bought. But across the period of ownership they have copped the amortization (plus wages) of the contract. If they sell all players for a price lower than the paid they will not be able to turn a profit But if he's good enough to keep them in the Premier League the tv money for that is crazy so you have to allow for that too But that‚Äôs exactly how book value is. PSR and UEFa both have windows so to determine the overall loss is really null when the cost is spread out, those windows don‚Äôt exactly line up at year 1 of player bought, the amortization is longer than those windows of PSR and UEFA, and the player sale shows up as a whole on that year sold.  Sale fee- amortization remaining = profit How Chelsea manages to give minutes to their players is still up for us to see, be it via loans, reselling or ""sharing ownerships"" with affiliated clubs to the same owners.  But at their current point of time, they're not a Real Madrid that have preference pick on their national league and money to buy consollidated players.  When any player from the PL that can make your squad costs between 70 to 90M, or players coming from Portugal or Netherlands that come from a good season are 40M+ signings and can be on a negative side Lindelof/VdB, medium side a Luis Diaz (50M for 25 goals in 3 seasons) and so on, you trace back to the previous development stage and try to double your chances.  When inflation hits a league hard, you can see it on the number of players by squad.  For example, the loan army for Parma before they went into bankruptcy (other Serie A teams had the same loan development tactic).  [2012‚Äì13 Parma FC season - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Parma_FC_season#Loan_out)  And this also happened to Deportivo by the end of their success term when they started to lack money and had to [bleed starting caliber players either on loans or free transfers.](https://i.imgur.com/11HbHFr.png)  The difference is that in the Parma and Deportivo times, there was no FFP rules to keep clubs viable economically in the long term, they pushed the boundaries looking for a break until they had taken too much debt to be sustainable, Chelsea are repeating the same pattern, only now the club should be safe from going bankrupt due to current restrictions.  In my dumb mind, clubs always return to this kind of martingale system signing promising players again and again until they can recoup their investments, as long as they have bankroll they'll keep going, and supposedly they'll always have bankroll as long as inflation helps Chelsea on the long term, and money revenues keep increasing their FFP threshold. Tbf, do you know the exact dates? UEFA was earlier than pl, so it's a possibility that some of the contacts are amortized longer in England than in Europe > **No**, the contracts that were signed before that are still valid  Have you tried reading posts before you reply? It will save everyone time.   > For PSR purposes **most** of Chelsea's signings are amortised over 5 years regardless of contract length.  UEFA changed their rules in June 2023, so unless Chelsea have no ambition to be a top 8 club for the next 3-4 years then they have to ensure the amortisation matches their rule change. That includes Lavia, Caicedo etc. It's anything from the 2024 calendar year onwards for the Premier League's rules too, so all of their business this window falls under that. Oh no, these people are vultures. I'm not saying he's a bad signing, but they spent 60 mil on Olmo when they already have several players who can play in the 10, and while Olmo can play those positions, there's no denying he's best at the 10. They are in a precarious financial situation where they have very little money to spend, and no good natural right back or DM (playing academy lads in the double pivot), and are spending 60 mil on a luxury player. There's more important signings to be made. It was reported repeatedly at the time. I guess The Athletic reported otherwise after the fact?   > ""The Independent has been told that Mudryk will be on over ¬£100,000 a week, with Arsenal having initially gone up to ¬£50,000 a week.""   https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-mykhailo-mudryk-transfer-arsenal-shakhtar-b2262535.html No reply from them since. I‚Äôm shocked, given how informed and involved in the deal they were? He did play for Inter yeah but for some reason I have no memory of him every being there No wonder Jackson's such a shit striker if Chelsea fans move the goalposts this much. Manchester United are one of the biggest brands in the world and only had two potential buyers, one being essentially a nation state. The pool of owners at that scale isn't big. That‚Äôs irrelevemt. They would still need to sell above 4.25 billion if their goal were to make a profit on the purchase of the club. From the start they've said their position is they see the Football market as being undervalued and are investing based on that. They're predicting the transfer spend of the premier league to [continue increasing](https://www.insideworldfootball.com/app/uploads/2023/09/image004.png), alongside the global audience continuing to grow. Many European leagues are also seeing an increase in investment which will further drive the prices of players. Maybe that's where the multi-club model comes in, because then they can acquire Strasbourg and other clubs, help them become competitive using what Chelsea have (and using Strasbourg to help Chelsea if it's possible), and sell those clubs for high multiples if they want to. A profit in one year, and a loss in each of the 4 years before that. Yeah I agree. Did you mean to reply to the bloke who replied to me?  This shit makes literally zero sense to me. All I've gleaned from these discussions is that accountants are basically professional liars and I now have a growing realisation of why the global economy is fucking doomed.  ""I have 5 cakes and 4 of them rot away and I swap the remaining cake for 2 apples, I'm 2 apples up baby, #winning"" Then one would have to wonder why they didn't just expressly build a team ready to challenge immediately, spend the same money, and have access to champions league income, higher cut of PL money, and a winning brand much more desirable to commercial interests.    Going back to my original example, 10m costs will be incurred in year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Since the sale happens on year 5, you have to include that.  In psr terms, the net effect will be this.  Year 1: -10m  Year 2: -20m  Year 3: -30m  Year 4: -30m  Year 5: +10m  Year 6: +20m  Year 7: +30m  Note how the negatives outweigh the positives. The total loss from all periods is -30m. It comes from 50m - 40m multiplied by the 3 years.  There is no running away from the fact that you‚Äôre paying more than you selling. Acting like the loss is ‚Äúreally null‚Äù just because its spread out its silly. And once you start adding more and more players those costs add up. With Chelsea, the worry isn't about it going bankrupt, the issue is that if this doesn't work out and the club stagnates their revenue would drop and so will the caliber of players that they can sign, as well as clubs buying from them would know that they're looking to offload their players so would have that advantage in negotiations etc. We weren't in any UEFA competitions lmao Oh no worries.   My buddy and I used to play PES 2011 all the time when we were kids.  He's an inter fan so he always have this dude as the main winger.  A cheat code in pes for sure. yeah but the value of the club went from like 900m to 4b or whatever the end valuation was that Ineos bought in at. They were asking for 5b at one point. The pool of individual owners isn‚Äôt big, but the pool of consortiums is quite large.   I don‚Äôt follow European sports teams values very closely. But the value of American sports franchises has skyrocketed since the 90s due to globalization and media rights. Seems to me Chelsea‚Äôs owners are playing for a similar outcome. Exactly and football clubs aren‚Äôt exactly the most profitable enterprises. What happens when you reach the threshold and no one wants to pay 10b for a club? You‚Äôre gonna turn the club into a selling club which is gonna hurt the team and then the value is going to drop even more. Sadly, At some point someone every club is going to have owners that are going to take money out of the club. It could be relevant if that ‚Äúclub investment‚Äù part doesn‚Äôt convey in a sale that happens within 10 years. Which is exactly the slimy shit I would expect out of a private equity firm.  Doing a quick flair check, I admit I am too unmotivated to validate this. The football market is extremely undervalued. The NFL makes more than twice as much money and they're only in the US. I don't particularly agree with their approach but I suppose if you look at it like an investor they are spreading risk/hedging by investing in lots of players where one or two failures can be offset by others succeeding. Whereas if you spend all your money on a few players and they get injured, lose form or struggle to settle in a new environment then you are fucked.  Of course that doesn't really consider the human element to it and I think it will be harder for them to build good team spirit with half the world on their books. I get that. But you‚Äôre assuming that year 1 and 5 exactly line up into the checks or windows that PSR or UEFA look into. Year 1 you bought the player, but this could could land on year 3 of the financial PSR check or vice versa.   And it‚Äôs not null in, I guess real life, but when clubs are abiding by the accounting for PSR and FFP, this is really all that matters. The net effect means nothing, only the player sale and amortization on the book. It sucks and isn‚Äôt how us casuals look at things, but obviously you can see why this causes clubs to take advantage. That doesn't matter. It matters to the finances going forward if you are paying 23m +wages for 5 years or 16.5m + wages for 7.  Multiplied by a bunch of players it adds up. But football is already globalised - the market cannot grow infinitely the problem with that is soccer is already globalized pretty much.... like banking on US getting on board, canada it isn't the most popular, Australia and Asia.  Which really if we are being honest it's hoping asia grows a ton, which is what is already happening for basketball.  So I guess hoping they realize most Asians are too short for basketball and switch to soccer as the major spreading sport. yeah but the market size of football in Europe is ¬£35bn compared to the NFLs ¬£4.8bn. The NFL is just set up to maximise profit and revenue for owners rather than being 'richer'. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶.not how it works? PSR checks every year dude None of the rule changes were retroactive. So yes, they are mostly 7 year amortised. I'm not sure what youre actually trying to say. Im saying it does matter since even if the UEFA rules came earlier, we weren't apart of UEFA that season so it didn't apply to us Of course it can‚Äôt grow infinitely lol, but it‚Äôs not as globalized as you think   America is a big market: ~350M people, wealthy, built in sports culture, growing number of soccer fans, really bad domestic leagues. Case in point - there is definitely a segment of the US that first heard about Liverpool when it was announced that LeBron was a part owner.   NBC (huge media company) has the rights to most EPL games and ESPN/Hulu have the La Liga rights. You could barely find either of those leagues on TV 10-20yrs ago here, so growth is definitely happening and will continue. The soccer/football wars are just now coming to the US.   No idea if Chelsea‚Äôs strategy is good. Just saying that the value of the clubs hasn‚Äôt peaked, and owners/fans exist outside of Europe and oil states. Yes every year BUT ‚ÄúPSR, one that will remain in place next season before reform arrives in 2025-26, allows for clubs to make losses of up to ¬£105million ($132.9m at the current exchange rate) over a rolling three-year period.‚Äù  That‚Äôs why the sale fee on that year is the key point of this. I‚Äôm not advocating for anything, but clubs take advantage of this for a reason. I know this. I know the pl rules were made after caicedo, even after Enzo and mudryk signed extensions, I'm just asking when the UEFA rules took effect All I'm saying is amortization is on the books for all years of the contract, so it has an impact on the finances throughout the next years, not only the year the deal was made Easiest way for American owners to make money is to grow the sport in America. Think that's what Boehly has in mind for sure....somehow. The part that makes no sense to me is the club valuation for Chelsea would have gone up year over year simply by virtue of being in the Prem. There was no need for this outlandish spending spree, they weren't going to get relegated. So Boehly/BlueCo will have invested billions between the purchase of the club and purchase of 100 players on which they won't make a profit.  So I think it's a combo of (1) Boehly knows the value will go up and spending some money between now and the long-term doesn't really matter, but (2) he did also think he'd figured something out that other clubs hadn't, and just turned the club into a vehicle for asset acquisition and speculation. If your point is that they will completely reform the system and wipe the slate clean by then then that‚Äôs a good point and something I‚Äôve speculated about myself.   But like, no shit right? Of course its not gonna matter if its gone. But its still here right now so it matters now. The end of June 2023. yes I know I said how in my comment. Media rights.   The ability to exclusively air certain sporting events is a multi-billion dollar game in the US. Media companies bid for leagues, and leagues then split the revenue. As a league grows, so do bids for its media rights.   NFL is maxed out, MLB is declining, and NBA is struggling to grow outside of social media. There is room here for competition. Even where the margins are tight, the monetary amounts are massive. There‚Äôs a reason all the big European clubs tour the US every year, and it‚Äôs not to sell merch or tickets to friendlies; it‚Äôs to grow media marketability.    The average American has little idea of what the EPL is. Mbappe or Bellingham or Vini could walk around the vast majority of the US without being recognized. That will (probably) not be the case for the next generation of European stars. I‚Äôm a lawyer not an accountant, and I also don‚Äôt follow this stuff too closely. I‚Äôm American so pretty casual about EPL finance rules.   I will say it‚Äôs fairly normal in MLB to sign long term guaranteed deals even if you‚Äôre not a superstar. NBA is also becoming that way. So 7+ year contracts for guys in their early 20s aren‚Äôt crazy in American sports.   I can‚Äôt do any of the financial wizardry, but I‚Äôm guessing they have some models showing that same investment strategy will work in the EPL. I guess it‚Äôs unusual but not like they‚Äôre idiots flying blind. No my point is the 3 year rolling period, the book value, the contract length, and the year the players is all matter.  That was a quote I took to show that, yes it‚Äôs every year checked, but on the backs of a 3 year period. So caicedo, signed august 2023, is amortized over 7 years for pl and 5 years for UEFA Issa joke my guy...about the way Boehly runs Chelsea smh Yeah, American as well, and there are obv some differences. In baseball, you're not expecting a massive drop-off in output when a player hits their early 30s. And in basketball, long-term contracts don't make it more difficult to sell somebody, which it can in football.   I know they're not total financial morons at BlueCo, but it def wouldn't be the first time an American franchise owner came to the PL and messed up trying to adapt business practices between very different competitive structures/sports. It's too early to tell of course how this will all play out, but right now (I'm biased) my guess would be that they haven't stumbled upon some magic formula because no one else thought of it, but because in the long run it won't pan out well. They could well be stuck paying several players for many years even if they confirm themselves to be completely not up to it. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm genuinely confused what you‚Äôre trying to say here. Yes I know they all mattwr. Yup You actually do see drop offs in the low/mid 30s in baseball, but not the point. I brought that up in part because both sports operate without true salary caps.   I brought up NBA because long term contracts make it easier to sell, especially if they have low wages. My guess is that Chelsea players‚Äô contracts have quite a few incentive clauses that aren‚Äôt accounted for when people say ‚ÄúX is making ‚Ç¨200k per week‚Äù but I could be wrong.   I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve stumbled upon magic either. They might be doing something really objectively stupid. Just saying they‚Äôre sophisticated bankers with models supporting their strategy, not ‚Äúidiot Americans who don‚Äôt understand anything about the EPL‚Äù like this sub parrots. I agree time will tell and they likely not coming out looking like geniuses."

Portugal getting bailed out Absolute cinema Shoulder to a head okay This is disgrace. It should be free kick for Czech. Yet Portugal scores just after ref mistake. Awful awful refering. Clear foul on the other end. Bullshit Absolutely shit ref and I don't even care for czechia Why no free kick for Czechia?? Should‚Äôve been a Czech free kick but you can‚Äôt defend like that. Faul on Czech before ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Missed foul on the other end leads directly to a goal. Fucked up Ref saved them Jesus Supersub  Martinez Masterclass Mart√≠nez masterclass lmao NETO WHAT AN IMPACT Horrible defending, horrendous refereeing Shit referring continues lmao Fucking farce Foul on semedo before this play that wasn‚Äôt given. The refereeing for this game has favored Portugal. Obviously bad call beforehand but no idea how to solve that with var  The foul wasn't called, play continues and then Portugal gets a kickoff. So the foul happens before the interruption of play and after that only cards are possible even though the continuation itself was wrong. Czechs were robbed. UEFA not beating the corrupt allegations. Hranac has cr7 posters in his bedroom I was gonna criticize our coach for the subs coming too late. Fuck me, right? The substitute combination So damn unlucky for the Czech!   But what a day of matches this has been! The commentator was asking why managers make changes for like 3 minutes ‚Äî because of THAT MARTINEZ GO FUCK YOURSELF 2nd day in a row a goal right after an incorrect call against the other side They cant keep getting away with this Kept the worst refs for the last few games I guess. Czech defender doing the kneel for no reason, you couldn't make it more obvious even if you tried tbh These dumbasses asking for a VAR review, when the ball went out CHICOOOOO Great game ruined by shit reffing in the end. Great job. Feels so unfair right after the Czech player got shoved and a foul wasn't given Nice, ignoring the Semedo foul.... Ridiculous Deserved Damn that's a shame. Czechia should have had the free kick before that. How does this goal stand considering the previous action was a foul?? What is the point of VAR # #JusticeForCzechia Unfathomly undeserved Lmao this shit is so rigged daylight robbery! that was the most obvious foul beforehand. Absolute bullshit. Clear obstruction seconds earlier, should have been a Czech free kick. Insane to not give that foul Clear foul in the build up All the comments are the same, we won, what a shammeeee right after a blatant foul that goes uncalled, ref is shite Poor Czechs The Czech had just a few minutes to not fk it up, sad. I betted on Portugal but ngl, this should've been a foul 20seconds beforehand Czech Republic got robbed of a well deserved draw, they fought hard for it and a single call erased all that work smh... Who? What a lucky win that was Semedo clocked that guy on the side on the play before, that's some bullshit. VAR needs a real revamp.  There's no way VAR should disallow something so benign as Belgium's goal yesterday and not look into the obvious foul that directly leads to Portugal's counter right after. Missed a blatant foul at the other end‚Ä¶ Should have been a freekick just seconds before that aswell bad ref the position was foul... portugal again with undeserved win well done euro24 Should have been a foul before that I was just praising VAR and you do this? Come on man it was faul before, fuck this shit Of course they score right after they committed a foul which the ref didn't call Absolutely robbed. Gutted for them. ofcourse after a clear foul not given [deleted] Ronaldo bailed again Absolute scam Robbed I fear. Czechia got screwed by the ref How come referees dont see that type of foul that we see it on tv clearly. Plus there is Var !!!! I don't want to see any Portuguese mad about Our world cup again lmao Inevitable lets fuckking goo boyyyy Ridiculous no call right down the field and they score lmao Hahahahaha Impact subs. I forget how good Neto is. Portugal really riding their luck here. my boy ü•π THIS PORTUGAL ISN'T GOING ANYWHRE! how is this legal?! Well done refs xd Official is a Portugal fan. What a refü§° game was rigged Ref robbed Czech republic by not giving the foul and card to portugal. Right after they score ROBBED. I have no words.  edit: keep downvoting me. it's the truth. this ref is a joke. S√ú√ú√ú Real Madrid effect When they have as much possession as they have had, you kinda expect this lol unfortunate for Czechia Super sub After all that work... Damnnnn Wtf Lol!!! It‚Äôs not been that Czech defender‚Äôs night, yeesh GIRUY Rotters Fuck you Martinez How do you say inevitable in Czech? This day is heartbreaking day Deserved just on that blunder alone by the defender, but should have been a foul previous. Such a winnable game from the Czech I'M BLIND I'M DEAF ... Atrocious refereeing on the play before. Foul 10 seconds beforehand. Czech defended poorly there but they were also ripped off taking shirt off lol Ref was actually doing somewhat okay until this. If fucking VAR rules were written as they should this goal would be overturned AS IT SHOULD BE. Fuck, im not even a Czech and I feel frustrated. He is HIM LETS FUCKING GOOOO yesss fuck all your sick jota jokes  WE CELEBRATE HERE Scandalous clear foul before Guys did you know that there should have been a foul before Refs hate Central European countries Of course this happens after the obvious foul isn't given  Czechia kinda deserve this tho. They've been truly AWFUL today Absolute robbery for the czechs. Portugal was more bark and no bite for the entirety of the game, somehow the referees AND VAR miss an obvious foul and the portugese score right after the missed call - dont know if there were strings being pulled behind the scenes but I cant call that a deserved win. woooooooooooooow Happy it wasn‚Äôt Jota This game went from mind numbingly boring to hard-core porn This one will be allowed because the celebration isn't an embarrassment That poor goalkeeper. That's just really unfair. BANGER OF A GOAL Super sub!! I've never really seen a match like this before. Portugal dominated the whole match but yet at the end it still feels like they were lucky to even get a point. The Czechs only had a few attacks but they actually threatened Portugal's goal and the goal itself was a beautiful strike. Meanwhile Portugal wasted chance after chance and only score on a deflection off the defender and a slip by both the defender and the keeper, neither goal would have scored in better conditions.  Portugal *should* have won that match but they also didn't deserve three points either. Clear foul by Semedo. And then there are people who genuinely think people ‚Äúhate Portugal because of Ronaldo‚Äù get out of here. No one cares, that was a foul and should‚Äôve been rightfully called. Doesn‚Äôt matter if Portugal score 7 after it, it should‚Äôve been called because it is a foul. It‚Äôs shocking refereeing and it‚Äôs stuff like this that make people turn away from football. Ridiculous with all of these CR7 fanboys and their stupid narratives. Shocked they‚Äôve even on Reddit to begin with [Replay/AA](https://imgur.com/a/foHqetG) Yep he is! He's a completely different player from 2 seasons ago. Kid has guts and his technical ability is already unbelievable Yes but actually no. Exactly. He is the one. I actually heard a kid say ""the late 1900s"" to refer to something in 90s we got 1998/2000 Champion Thuram's son playing for France too. New generation, lot of similar names ;) He is doing like his dad, putting smiles on the faces of all their fans. Own goal was because of the keeper, not the defender Just really unlucky on both occasions, neither are his fault But overall great performance, he had some really good postioning and defensive tackles. slap nose straight cooing marry shy different existence worry cooperative   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* His system is criminal. A 343 starting 3 full backs when you have that much attacking talent. Making Bruno play in a double pivot. Keeping 39 year old CR7 as the main striker for the whole game. Martinez is the real bald fraud, saved by coaching the most talented squad in the tournament. I wondered the same. I don't like managers not doing early substitutions when the team is behind. Subscribe. Euro 2000 wasnt it I can't wait to see that happen. Legendary duo: concaicaieo and ronaldo Kobe and Kwame Brown meme ""Concecaio""? jesus christ man He‚Äôs the commentator talking about ‚Äúwhat can you do in 3 mins?‚Äù :D He's been fucking horrendous all game lmao Not even a single Leverkusen player playing Absolute heartbreaker Vegas made the call. It‚Äôs Conceicao‚Äôs world and we‚Äôre all living in it Everything he says is wrong, yet he says it with such confidence‚Ä¶ Madness lol Absolute clown show Danny Murphy criticises Danny Murphy.

Da vontade de chora beb√™ [deleted] Assim ainda sabe melhor... Can anyone translate? El portugues con mas verg√ºenza deportiva: chicanea un 2-1 en fase de grupos Ganhou contra um time ruim, calma ai Same as the non-corner call yesterday. Scripited rigged. Ronaldo illuminati No idea how the ref missed that one but he also thought it was fine to start a scrap after the offside goal. Story of the euro, happened way too often with way to clear scenes Absurd take. Ref let them play all game. Ref had no influence in the goal, whatsoever‚Ä¶ They got away with so much yellow cards not given, absolutely horrendous referring It gave Portugal a goal kick, but okay. I agree it was a foul, but come on, man. üßÇüßÇüßÇ But the ball was also out of play. The didn't have a issue with going back into their positioning. It wasn't even in the same play, it was like 2 minutes after. The game stopped even, the ref checked on the player complaining. The goal would've happened anyway. Use your brains for a change. I'm portuguese and we won with crappy goals made by Czech mistakes, but blaming the ref is pathetic There's only so much luck you can rely on if you're Czechia. Why didn‚Äôt he review the foul in VAR after the goal? Yeah, because the ref actually passed the ball to Neto. You can see it a few frames back Este est√° a falar de que jogo? Czechia was robbed 100% in that situation. Disastorous decision by the referee. Classic for Portugal here, happened for several of their goals when they won back in 2016. EURO 24: We want to give trophy to portugal any questions? I  bet the ref got 9 or 10 out of 10 in rating Somehow the ref nailed Leao‚Äôs dive but has been blind for the rest of the game Genuinely such a blatant foul too, absolutely shocking from the ref there  Fucking infuriating if youre Czech I legitimately can't fathom how you miss that foul as a professional referee.  Semedo basically fucking tackled him lol. Pivotal missed call Queres uma babete para o choro?   CARREGA PORTUGAL 52 officials not one paying attention üëç Devia mas n√£o foi Easy yellow, as well as when Portugal player took down the Czech defender covering the ball five minutes earlier. This time really cost the Czechs. Maybe but they could've also tried defending lol should‚Äôve defended better It sucks when a refs mistake leads to a goal. Should have been a free kick for Czechia here, and a corner for Austria (but he have a goal kick to France and then the goal was scored) It was like 2 minutes before, stop pretending it was some kind of counter-attack, otherwise VAR could've checked Portugal getting favourable decisions in the Euros, a tale as old as time. it's portugal you think they let them go with 1-1 ?????? ref should take off his t-shirt I'm sure it's a portugal jersey  under For what? Running into someone? close distinct wipe knee pocket weather engine cautious boast cagey   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* That's Guida for you. That staple Serie A refereeing can't surprise me anymore. Yep. Should've been a free kick Czech blood will be boiling tonight üò≠üë∂ Chico>>>>>Bernardo In a game without any space idk why we didn't have our most creative players playing but yeah...   Leao was alright this match Can‚Äôt agree with this, le√£o in my opinion is the more talented player in Portugal team. It just easily disrupts any defense. [deleted] Most blatant foul and yellow card you‚Äôll ever see Ref fucked them not giving that, it was so obvious as well Foul o caralho que te foda Should've been a Czech fk Sometimes the ball does lie Thought the ref had been decent in letting the game flow but there's no universe in which that's not a foul by Semedo. Gutwrenching way to lose for Czechia Foul 45 sec before of guy that stays down 1 min and then gets up instantly lmao 100%, fucking refs Lmao a random play on the other half of the pitch ok yeah that's how the goal appeared, because otherwise Czechia would have just kept the ball until the end.  Maybe hravac should've cleared the ball properly instead of falling down and handing it on the platter to conceicao??? Yeah, the foul on the play before made it so that both the defender and the gk fumbled it during the play of the goal. Damn trip-inducing foul! Clear fucking foul on the Czech player not given and Portugal win it what a fucking disgrace Ok Hahahahahahaha chora [deleted] [deleted] PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO ü¶ù I am not sure if Wolves will be able to keep him this summer 1984 great season playing for his dad now scoring for his country, amazing First time ? Try to be French during the World Cup or the Euros and it's the same in every match thread My personal dislike is for Bruno Fernandes The real question is: How deluded do people have to be to think this goal should count? The foul beforehand was clear as day. People are rightfully angry that a team got handed a victory by a ref that was favoring them the entire game. This would happen to any other big country. Don't make it about ronaldo. Haven't seen one person mention him Nunca duvidei. Odeio/amo o fedelho Est√° no caminho certo para acabar o m√™s no meu clube de tripeiros/lampi√µes que eu tolero e at√© gosto por causa da sele√ß√£o, atualmente presidido pelo senhor Pepe. I'm a Chico hater but he does get the ball in the net and for the next few weeks that's all I need. This should be the take of this sub ‚Ä¶ I think like this even when I watch the shit show of the small Portuguese league teams doing this against my rivals Finally a smart comment in this thread This is an interesting take tbh. Defending is not anti football. It is still football. They were heavy underdogs. People need to stop thinking football is about goals and going forward. Defending is very much part of football too. This comment actually drove me crazy I understand why they had to do it but that new name is just never gonna stick Both of them chase encourage violet deliver whistle enjoy gaze unwritten square tease   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* To be fair it has been raining Both goals were hilarious defensive fuck-ups, which TBH was the only way we were going to score tonight. The guy who got beaten on the wing, sure, but the ball is deflected by one Czech player onto one who is trying to stop and readjust his feet in heavy rain. The player who deadens the ball right in front of goal was just really unlucky. Awful refereeing They got cheated by the ref beforehand but both goals have been absolute gifts, you can‚Äôt get results against big teams when you do that. q jogador caralho It happens all the time when people want a different result.  There's a case here though (people lose it over maybes but it was a pretty clear and easy foul to give) and I'm pretty sure Portugal fans wouldn't have been happy if the roles were reversed. Ainda por cima metade destes caralhos n√£o percebem boi de bola. So you're proud that after having gotten the easiest group you still need a biased ref to win against one of the weaker teams in this EURO? Weird flex, but okay. Bota sal nas bifanas caralhoooo Your team played like absolute shit. 85% posesion and 0 goals scored. And you're celebrating illegitimate goal. How embarrassing. It's a fucking disgrace Keep crying after todays game at least you have a reason cause hungry agonizing skirt pause silky flag ad hoc narrow fuzzy   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Don't even bother, brother. It's the usual hate VAR can't do anything as that was before the goal kick. It was like 2 minutes before, the goal would've happened anyway, it was a different play I think because play was stopped for the head injury, VAR can't overrule it? A shame Exactly. How is that not checked? Is there a time limit for VAR to be able to intervene? This is such bullshit for it to happen on the counter-offensive. var works for big teams not for small teams if it's portugal there is no VAR Favorites bring always $$$$$$$$$$$ I'm sure REF got at least 9 out of 10 in ratings. if You are Czech, Turkey, Georgia.. Var won't work for them! What are you on? World class reffering ISTO √â TUG√ÉO CARALHO! Get refereed* Acting like that had any impact on the goal lmao. This coping and seething is breathing life back into me Shouldn‚Äôt have changed their country‚Äôs name, no one can take Czechia seriously Czechia had 10 people in the box for most of the game. it's wasn't really possible to play much different Idk man there was a foul not given to portugal in the first half so i think its unfair that the Czechs scored their first goal... what fucking logic is this... Sure, maybe it was a foul, but the attack to the goal starts from stopped play long after that challenge... The ball went out after that. Not the same instance of play. If Diogo caught the ball and then resumed, then VAR could take a look. illegal six treatment attractive yoke depend crown expansion grey door   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Counter?? Attack starts from a goal kick, after the game was stopped for like 30 sec, while the player tries to roll his way to inside the pitch... i get the hate but we are reinventing history now?... What's var meant to do here? Keep crying after todays game you have a reason Should be more worried about losing 3-0 to Spain but to each their own Stupid take. Maybe because there's 30+ different camera angles?  Hell, the UK commentator didn't see the foul clearly until the last replay shown.   Var can't intervene for this either. What? Im portuguese and 90% of the people i know clearly wanted Argebtina over France. Not sure where you got this take from. Only here you guys make everything about Messi vs Ronaldo lmao so true, PENALTY FOR ARGENTINA Aside from his skills, it's his attitude on the pitch that I like the most. Wish you'd see that from more players.¬† Yet he's not good enough for Ajax. The mismanagement at our club is real. Adopted? To be fair, the 90s was on a whole other millenium, for Gen Z, that era could damn well be as late as the fucking Renaissanse. Imagine playing a GK from Czech league over Invincible BuLi winner I‚Äôm not a fan of Martinez but he deserves credit here for at least making the right calls that provided the assist and goal. Like you said, would‚Äôve been a lot better earlier on, but the right call and won the match Yes the system is bad and he keeps trying new things at this stage. Absolute bellend. You got the system wrong. It was a 3-4-3 only in paper, because in practice it was more of a 2-5-3. We played a super high line with intense pressure. One of the CB's was occupying the pivot role (it was either Mendes or Dias, they switched around depending on from where they were attacking) and both Vitinha and Bruno played up high. We obviously won't be playing like this against teams with pacy wingers that can punish it with fast transitions, but since Czechia doesn't have this sort of players, it was actually very smart from Martinez. I will never forget that game!¬† Portugal in the group with Germany and England and they go top of the group!¬† ¬´I didnt look it up or literally just hear some commentator talk about it I swear¬ª Ronaldo taking the young Concecaiecao under his wing, beautiful stuff Reminds me of the concentrao meme where they butchered coentrao's name lol Talk about fking up someones name lol My wife knows the answer Yep lol Both of them have been absolute shite lol I like the part where he said ""huh did you ask me a question?"" üòÇ what taking out Schick does to a mf I bet Portugal over 1.5 goals in the secondüòÇ Yep, Neto or Chico should start on the right I love Bernardo, but he was invisible in this setup. One of Vitinha/Bernardo has to go. But Dalot didn't help matters on that right side at all.  Mind you, I think if we were starting Ramos instead of Ronaldo, it would be a different story and Bernardo would be way more effective. He combines way better with him (and frankly, the whole team combines better Ramos, but Ronaldo is Ronaldo). it‚Äôs interesting as Martinez got to that so late, but it‚Äôs not a coincidence he‚Äôs subbing in two left footers like that. I‚Äôm just surprised that sub was made in the 90‚Äô. Felix is an obvious choice to be subbed on but tactically it didn‚Äôt make sense. The idea to have Nuno Mendes do the job In√°cio has done flawlessly all year long for Sporting was just... *Intersting*. I kinda get that he wanted him to play as a faux full back while Cancelo provided the width, but that also put him in the role of the main distributor through the left and... his passing wasn't it.

Mas adorei a rea√ß√£o do subreddit, parece que roubamos o ouro a algu√©m Yeah that pissed me off to an unnerving extent tbh Bruh FIFA rigged this. They have a rage boner against Portugal here because of Ronaldo. Don't try to reason with these idiots What, that was a clear foul. you mean the Czech's absolutely The Czechs only got one yellow card, there were multiple no calls for them but just because they were the underdogs no one calls that out. Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes and co playing dirty for a full game and not getting penalised? I'm shocked. Shocked I tell you.  Edited to add: Czech were absolutely at it too, but a bunch of the Portuguese players have a tendency to do this and avoid punishment. I was expecting a check for a red card for that foul in the 85th minute or so. Then I remembered the treatment favorites get this EURO. In overtime it's a huge momentum changer. Portugal shouldn't have had possession Explain how the goal would have happened anyway. With the free kick every scene to the final whistle would have been completely different. Portugal might have scored 2 more goals, maybe Czech would have scored from the free kick. The only thing certain is that this Portugal goal would not have happened the way it did. They didn't get much, both goals they conceded were rather unlucky. Was a different passage of play. You can‚Äôt go back to a foul or other incident that happened before a recent restart.¬† Cause the ball went out, game started with goalkick, its a new play, so clean goal, but a bad decision before but still, to much drama from Czech player. What goals? Ya? Which ones specifically did it happen on? Can you tell which ones? I'm going to say you can't because that's a lie. Lol, your hate for Portugal is huge Diga um? Even before the dive he's been letting some pretty rough play go on, but this one is egregious. Absolutely no play on the ball, went straight for the the head / shoulders. he didnt care about any contact An Argentinian guy commenting about a referee is insane Which makes it even fishier. Because if he had fallen for the dive, VAR would have dunked on him. So he was only making the right calls when they would have been overturned anyways.  Still don't think there's an actual conscious bias there, just your basic ""let's favor the favorites"" we've seen for Germany, France, etc. What? This is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve seen leao wasn‚Äôt a dive lol Am Czech, can confirm I'm not even and my injustice bells are going off For sure, but it's not like they tried to win at any point of the match [deleted] Fairly poor positioning really, he's looking through about 5 or 6 players at the moment the foul happens. The 4th official probably has the best view of it and should be helping him out there. Two Czech players were in front of the ref when the foul happened, blocking his sight. Ridiculous response, it never should have mattered. Terrible refereeing Ricochet off the first, offset the second. Keeper slipped. A series of unfortunate events. It was 30 seconds, which game did you watch? No ones saying it was a counter but it changed possession in a key way and your making up the 2 minute bit. Did time start about 5 minutes ago? lol what? Bro are you high? You probably been watching football for 1 year And under that shirt? A Portugal flag tattoo It was up the other end of the pitch and there was a stoppage. If that's the worst decision we see then we'll have had a good tournament. He clearly looks and body checks him - what are you on about? Bernardo playing like he is, we should have brought Pote It's funny because on every match thread, there's a comment like ""it's staple [any national league name] refereeing"" lmao Is there any league in the world where people are happy with the refs? Sit back and invite 20 shots from Portugal and you're bound to eventually get unlucky. And rightly so, that‚Äôs an absolute disgrace Unironically more goals than Bernardo in tournaments in his first game. Hotel>>>>>>Trivago Hotel > Trivago Couldn‚Äôt give a good cross to save his life it seems - it was very frustrating S√≥ camones a chorar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7T4ImANmYg ""Should"" is an interesting word üòú I'm sorry but why are you all acting so offended by this? Can you honestly say you'd be totally okay if the shoe was on the other foot? You would be furious and rightly so. Portugese fans better hope to fuck no decision goes against you for the rest of the tournament. Hahahaha what are you on about  It was a clear foul pal. That doesnt matter, does it? Where did i say that? I said that goal was bs. Which it was. Because of the foul from Semedo He didn't say that mate. He said it's bullshit. Czechia absolutely should have had a free kick in the play directly before this goal. Never should've had the ball. Ref gave you a freebie. Yes you don‚Äôt There is no ""deserve"" in football whos saying that I don't know who deserves what but I think the ref was favoring Portugal a lot in several decisions during the last 20min of the game, a foul given here or there isn't as obvious but this should have been a free kick for Czechia before Nah Portugal has done nothing but possess and pass, first goal was the lamest of the tournament None of us expect to. We just want him to do well this tournament and stay healthy so we can sell him for his best price. The only reason we would is if his suitors are worried about injuries. He is bloody dynamite and fully deserving of the Champions League. Don't worry he'll be out for seven months before the season starts Tldr: Este beb√© t√° a chorar Now say it without crying üòÇü´µ I mean the goal would not have happened if the free kick was given, but VAR could not disallow the goal because the game was interrupted already between the goal and the foul. So in that regard everything went by the book. Let‚Äôs be honest, you‚Äôd celebrate too if that‚Äôs how your team scored. Being a fan isn‚Äôt always about being logical and that‚Äôs part of the beauty if you ask me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Chora mais. The result was gonna be this no matter what, that no call changed nothing in the end. The ref carded Le√£o for flopping earlier in the game Defending is only part of football if you're not Portugal it seems. Or everyone changed their minds from 2016 to 2024. Re-read the comment. The criticism isn't about Chechia's strategy, it's about the suggestion that this was a close game. Up until the goal they were neutralized to the point that they couldn't even get a counter going. Even as the game got stretched they weren't a big threat and were obviously playing for the tie. Very much agree with you. Defending is as important as scoring goals. the game is dead anyways Ty, is that you? still no excuse for that defending Glasses? Ref not spotting a foul is cheating now huh He fell to his knees I think it‚Äôs absolutely overblown, there is always something like this in every game Chora bebe ü§´ They kind of earned that group. They had the best qualifying of any team to get there. They badly outplayed them today. Embarrassingly so.   I actually checked out for chunks of it because it was boring me to sleep. A biased Ref didn‚Äôt hand them the game. They could have scored any other way. It‚Äôs wild to say Czech was going to hold them off inviting their attack the way they were.   Let me give you  a preview of that free kick: Czech‚Äôs with less then 3 wasted touches and back to our regularly scheduled programming of 11 men around the box trying to survive. Chora palha√ßo, vai maz√© para o crl monte de merdaz queres uns len√ßos oh idiota? Chupa-pilas do caralho, vai p√° merda. Chupa-me a ponta da cachola if it makes you this mad, yes get a flair cuntface Your crying is so rejuvenating Chupai I mean, I wonder if they will start with   Ronaldo paid to win this cup, after this match   Or that's only for messi? Nobody asked, but ok Chora mais. There were multiple no calls from the ref for Czechia but no one mentions it. The hate for Ronaldo is absurd in this sub. I know, that‚Äôs why I said should rather than will. Still bullshit [deleted] Would've been a free kick for Czech, even if doesn't go in, it would lead to diff outcomes. Instead you have half the Czech team now distracted by the unfair no call. But happened happened I guess. Portugal has more work to do if they can barely win against Czech with over 70% possession. Maybe because the ball went out for goal kick ? I would recommend learning how VAR works. It can't interfere in these just checked your comments, turkish crybaby that hates Portugal Chora caralho If there was a free kick given instead of a goal kick, which let to a goal, Czechia would have had possesion. So obviously that horrendous call to give a goal kick instead of a free kick let directly to the goal. Do we know how the game would have played out if the free kick was given? No, we don't, but that call had massive impact. Not sure what you mean by coping, I didn't have a stake in this match, it's just unfair Idk..Portugal looked sluggish but that just might be me I don't agree with ""maybe it was a foul"" because it's very clear for me lol, and I believe it's the very next play so not really long after the challenge. Still yeah, Czechia could've defended better but it's a big miss from the ref ‚ÄúMaybe it was a foul‚Äù ¬†cmon man From Pepe himself His attitude off the pitch could be improved but that's bad influences (his father) Don't know what you guys fed him but ge returned an absolute beast He‚Äôs not going to be the coach next year I wonder how the last alive person born in the second millennium will be looked at. I knew it was the right call. But it was too late, we were lucky with the shitty ref in our side. These should have been made like in min 80 at least! Really hope he learned his lesson , absolute knobhead deserves credit for making the right call? It was painfully obvious their 4 fullbacks werent working in the first half and subs needed to be made the entire 2nd half and somehow he deserves credit. Credit for one of the worst managerial games of the year! Last game against Germany, we were through and so we rotated heavily. Still won 3-0. Figo's rocket and Jo√£o Pinto's diving header vs England, beautiful¬† Also, that game we played the subs because we already had qualification secured, noone was expecting us to win, and Concei√ß√£o goes and scores a hattrick. My earliest football memory is Phil Neville giving away a penalty against Romania in the last minute to eliminate us from that tournament Romania also qualified! Beat England 3-2 Erich Ribbeck terrorbal. But to be fair, Germany's talents were dire back then. Oh man we actually played amazing back then. Shame for Abel Xavier handball Lol  I was not even in high school and Conceicao was my favourite portuguese player.. And i remember because I used to play with him in the EURO 2000 game on the PS1 hahaha and then he scored the hat trick against germany with a proper banger Let's be real, Concaicecaiceao is already a bigger name than Ronaldo. Yeah, I know some portuguese names are not easy, but like please make the effort to write it well, if you think it's tricky to write it then copy and paste it, it's that easy lol No need to show off mate how would you do with 6 minutes? Dont worry bro, She's happy with 2 minutes of cuddling Schick was AWFUL today TBF /u/aleksandrovqist sent the chopper over to the stadium. I had a draw. Was about to win 4x my bet... fml. He always seems to have issues in this squad, I don't think he's been in great form all year tho to be fair, but always looks a step down for Portugal. Normally that's still a really great player but he's felt a bit off all year. They're the only wingers that were on the bench, i don't think it matters the fact that they are left footed. But yeah, i think he should've subbed at least one of them sooner The thing is we attacked almost in a 4 line because cancelo was always in the midfield, so at many times it ""made"" (bar the RB turn LB turn CM as a CM) sense in theory, but trying it the first time at the euros with an actual left footed CB who is good at progressive passing is very interesting indeed. I understand what Martinez was going for. He understood Czech were going to be so defensively deep and their quality was going to be low going forward. To break down low blocks with ease, you need rotations and nothing is more dynamic than overlapping outside center backs tactically. The only issue is Mendes and Dias were quite poor quality wise going forward. Leao was OK but he seemed uncomfortable as it never seemed he knew when to stay inside or go wide, and Silva drifting inside a lot which resulted in Portugal being extremely narrow. You need width to break down low blocks. Besides their wonder goal and 1-2 nice crosses, Czech were absolutely horrid going forward, Portugal were open to be killed in transition and Czech were let down by quality Joga o Ronaldo, tens meio mundo a torcer contra ele. Nada de novo.   (e aten√ß√£o que o Semedo faz falta clara, mas o vi√©s do /r/soccer quando joga Portugal √© evidente) Desde que Portugal seja um dos favoritos para vencer o torneio querem que sejam eliminados para terem uma chance. J√° vi uns quantos Turcos no Reddit a choramingar. Que piada, Portugal vai liderar este grupo em pontua√ß√£o facilmente. foda se, se tu so metes o bacalhau de molho de um dia para o outro de facto nao precisas de mais sal, vais medir essa tens√£o. Os portugueses n√£o comem bacalhau fresco! Quando o pescamos mete-se em sal para o conservar.   Se for para comer tem que se demolhar evidentemente. Bacalhau fresco comem os noruegueses e mesmo assim... Bro o bacalhau se nao for salgado com aquele processo vai saber-te a pescada (mesmo que seja preciso depois dessalgar) E ganhou com um penalty de brinde por jogo, mas n√£o se pode falar nisso ... Sim, mas irrelevante, s√≥ havia uma equipa que merecia pontos deste jogo. Um jogo sem espa√ßo como este os criativos que entraram aos 90 j√° deviam estar em campo desde os 70 Ronaldo atrapalhou? bem pelo contr√°rio at√© acho q ele teve um bom jogo It actually says ""Are you crying?"" ah yes, Portugal the famous spanish speaking country Uma virgonha kkkk Virgonha kkkk Ganhamos contra Gales 2-0 na meia final, nem a dizer merda dizes como deve ser co√±ito N√≥s temos uma das melhores ligas do planeta, muitos dos maiores talentos do desporto s√£o Portugueses. O Ronaldo √© um √≠cone mas n√£o pode carregar a equipa sozinho. >se creen grandes por tener a Ronaldo  Uh? Now that's a huge huge hot take. I think we have a shoot at the tittle cause of our loaded roster, not because of some old man who shouldn't be doing 90 minutes every fucking match just because he used to goat every once in a while. Fala baixo se n√£o ainda te compro o pa√≠s com a mesada Un t√≠tulo es un t√≠tulo broder, lo imporante es ganar.   En 2010 Paraguay casi nos saca (si es q eres espa√±ol). A todo se le puede sacar defectos.   Es de perdedor criticar a un justo vencedor que no necesit√≥ ayuda arbitral para ganar un torneo de semejante importancia. It was a clear foul and you're the one throwing a tantrum, calling other people idiots and not giving any reasonable argument. So who exactly is the idiot here Yeah don't forget, portugal is just the bigger country... the hate for ronaldo is wild üßÇüßÇüßÇüßÇ cry me a river Gotcha, didn‚Äôt realize the ball went out That's the stupidest thing I have seen, he clearly dives and tries to make contact with the defender in mid air, great spot from the ref and then he misses a simple foul before the winner. I'm Portuguese and even I can admit it was clearly a dive, it was the right call. But to then have a bunch of sore losers say that the ref was playing for Portugal even after that just because they want to see Ronaldo fail is absurd to say the least.   There were no calls from both teams, the stronger team just came out with the win in the end. Not Czech, still infuriated [deleted] Same Definitely deserved the ref to not give a foul then. How dare they set up defensively against one of the favourites all the while being the youngest squad in the tournament On the other hand, we were getting lucky whole game (not ref-wise, but score-wise) so it's not like we can complain all that much. Now if we were competitive in the match, that would be a different story. As far as missed calls go that should have been the least inconsequential spot when it comes to Portugal scoring only ricocheted off the first lad because he tried clearing it with his cock I mean, I'll admit that I watch Serie A the most. Probably EPL after that, and the refereeing there is also atrocious. Also, I was mostly ok with UCL refereeing last season. I would say that the dutch refs are usually pretty good BuLi is fine I have often thought about this. If every single country says ""classic \[our refs\]"" isn't it just because the job is actually impossible to do? Or at least that they aren't given tools to do it. If everyone is bad, then it isn't an issue with refs In a super controversial take I'm fine with Prem refs, most of the time people lose there minds over viable calls, probably the same most of the time with other leagues too. Democratic People's Republic of Korea What a stupid take In only his second touch too J√° sabem que n√£o vem para casa The ball went out for a goal kick (!). If I hadn't watched the game and saw this thread I'd have thought they'd given us a penalty or a dangerous free kick or something. But no, Czechia had the entirety of the pitch to deny us from scoring in two minutes. Was it not a close game? The very fact that it took a last minute winner justifies their strategy IMO. Do you think a gun-ho approach would have yielded a closer result? Is that why they keep putting it at half price constantly? No it was awfully defended. No doubt. But it should have never come to that ‚ÄúCheated by the ref‚Äù is a very common saying for a ref not spotting something and affecting the outcome, you‚Äôre just arguing over semantics rather than the actual events of the game here. You got insanely lucky after a poor performance, take it and run. It's the timing of being before a goal and near the end plus most of the time the foul is somewhat debatable but it was pretty comically clear. This guy been crying in all Portugal posts LOL what a sore loser Congratulations on being pathetic. :) You do realize that I'm not crying but laughing at you, right? Lol OP didn‚Äôt mention Ronaldo. I get he‚Äôs a national hero but quit looking for the fake persecution. It was a bad no call that affected the outcome of the game late. No idea how to fix that though other than looking at every single possible foul Why lmao, entirely different passage of play √úber die Jahre hab ich hier und da mal andere gesehen, aber echt sehr selten. Kiel auch sehr wenig, aber k√∂nnte auch daran liegen, dass man das ""eigene"" Wappen eher wahrnimmt. Is there any actual written evidence in the rule of that being a key aspect of VAR intervention?  Genuine question, because I know that the ball being played after a goal makes the goal unreviewable, but in this instance, an argument could always be made that the uncalled foul less than 30 seconds before was a determining factor leading to the goal scoring opportinity. Crying for a fault before game being interrupted... is something else You know, maybe thats why the VAR dont act there. Idk just saying If my Grandmother had wheels she would have been a bike That's also quite speculative. For all we know the ball could just go out for a goal kick on that hypothetical FK, and the play would resume exactly the same way.  Yeah it was a bad call, but pretending that the goal happened because of it is incredibly biased. It would have been different if Neto had fouled some player on the run-up obviously. Thats not the point is it... sure, it was a foul if you wish but fouls get not given all the time... the goal starts from a totaly independent play. Czech just suck at defending... witch says a lot of how bad the Portuguese were... Because Pepe speaks for the whole country clearly Honestly it's more on the pitch lol. He's not very talked about outside the game He arrived at an absolute shit show and was like nope, I will work even harder to earn my spot at Porto That would actually be someone born on the 31st of December 2000 Wad this the Euro where  Zidane hit that penalty 120th minute in the semis. Toughest game on that group for Portugal as well. Costinha only scored after 4 minutes of injury time and Romenia gave our defense quite a bit of trouble. Quite literally - 15 letter name vs. 7 letter name I always rated Concavecone. What do I look like? A fucking Kenyan marathon runner? Jesus fuck don't be setting up such unreasonable expectations I've found a good tip is to take your underwear off slower. What's happening for the other minu.....?  Ah Draw was a good shout Felix played on the wing at Barca the whole year. Preferred foot matters a lot for breaking down low blocks. Nem dev√≠amos meter os p√©s nessa merda. Soccer? √â football foda-se! Pois... La t√°... So pensei na fase de demolhar... Porque o compro assim e tal e qual fazia a minha m√£e... Sem pensar que se o tens que demolhar √© porque algu√©m o meteu em sal... Meia-noite passada, o Tonecas diria que √© hora de ir dormir... Tamb√©m acho. Interesting, chorare then is crying now not cry later. You do realize spanish and portuguese are insanely similar to the point where i can get 90% of what they are writing without ever studying portugurse in my life? Portuguese and Spanish are very similar. Portuguese people can understand the majority of what a Spanish speaker says and the same goes for the Spanish with Portuguese. I'm just messing with you guys, you have a nice team this cup Comprate una copa del mundo Acting like that foul changed the entire game is insane Not really? I've got no skin in this game lol, just saying what I see Tell that to Bruno praying to the ref after he kicks a guy in the head pretending he's done nothing wrong.   Nothing against Portugal as a country, but about 60% of the current NT squad are unpleasant, I dunno what to tell you. Newsflash dude had it been called it would have been a free kick and the whole play would have developed differently, even if CZ lost possession after it No one is ever happy with the refereeing and im guilty of it. It hurts me seeing people complain about the refs in the prem when here in Portugal we have so sit through some of the most negative, stop and go, terrorist like football ever concived bc refs just cant control the match. I guess the grass allways seems greener on the other side, but sometimes its the best that we have Germans are really good at following rules It's true. Referee mistakes happen almost every game. If one small refereeing mistake on the other end of the pitch is the reason you lost, it doesn't inspire tears of sympathy from me. But it shouldn't have been a goal kick. You know this, I know this, anyone with eyes knows this. 2 minutes doesn't matter for shit when 90% of it occurred when the ball wasn't in play. You scored almost directly from the immediately succeeding passage of play. Noone is blaming Portugal. Noone is saying you are shit. Your team did what any other would do. Why are you defending refereeing mistakes solely because they benefited you? It's insane. Just say ""yeah they should've had a free kick but what can you do?"". Exactly. If it wasn‚Äôt a close game, Portugal would‚Äôve ran away with it. They didn‚Äôt and Czech had every right to play ‚Äúanti football‚Äù because they were the weaker team. If they went any other way, Portugal would‚Äôve had 2 or 3 goals by half time. My thing is to say it‚Äôs ‚Äúanti football‚Äù is so ridiculous because many weaker teams set up to defend against strong opposition. Why wouldn‚Äôt they? They‚Äôre not matching the other team on quality so best to defend. And then to say they deserved to lose because they defended well is so stupid. Like idk if we watched the same match but they had some chances. They were just unfortunate with mistakes and some dodgy refereeing Yeah they sold 25% less or something like that. Still making a lot off the gambling though. The foul happen long before, even went for a goal kick. But it's Portugal so let's protest for that foul long ago lol It's not like czechia were any good either. Portugal dominated the entire game. It wasn't just luck that won them the game Couldn't say it was clear honestly. If it was blatant, it would have been whistled as a foul...   The ref even gave a yellow card to Le√£o and everybody was praising him, there was even a guy saying that it was one of the best shows of refereeing in the entire tournament.    The hate is real on this sub, simple as that. Never said OP mentioned him. But that's clearly what's affecting this entire discourse, look at this subreddit.  The game was rightfully won, the Czech team had an opportunity and they couldn't take it, next game there will be something else to use as an excuse for Portugal winning decisively. One way would be to give teams a (very very limited ) number of challenges where they can request a VAR review of an otherwise non-reviewable call (or non-call).  I‚Äôm sure this would cause other complications but it would give a team some recourse after a blatant ref error. Relevant rules from IFAB protocol   > * For decisions/incidents relating to goals, penalty/no penalty and red cards for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO), it may be necessary to review the attacking phase of play which led directly to the decision/incident; this may include how the attacking team gained possession of the ball in open play  > * The Laws of the Game do not allow restart decisions (corner kicks, throw-ins etc.) to be changed once play has restarted, so they cannot be reviewed  > * If play has stopped and restarted, the referee may only undertake a ‚Äòreview‚Äô, and take the appropriate disciplinary sanction, for a case of mistaken identity or for a potential sending-off offence relating to violent conduct, spitting, biting or extremely offensive, insulting and/or abusive action(s) 117th to be more precise. After a hand by Abel Xavier, he scored the Golden Goal on a penalty. It was a poor game that one, both sides seemed happy with a draw and afraid to lose  We also played in the qualifiers and managed to both go directly to the Euros, so both teams knew what the other was capable of. Still a very big restul for both teams to leave home England and Germany, goes to show what a terribly hard tournament the Euros was when it had only 16 teams. Still is, but then it was something else. fighting ED He isn't really a winger tho is he He made a typing error, meant to say ""chorar"" which is ""crying"", the ""Ta a"" part can be translated to ""Are you"" since it's a question. Quem ganhou foi a sele√ß√£o da Catalunha I mean, it kinda did. With the correct call the situation leading to the Portugal goal would not have happened. It did. Czechs have the chance to setup for a late freekick into the box. Minimum of a minute there to do that. And then we are basically at the final whistle. Bruno barely touched him... Thats probably because they hurt you, somewhere, somehow  ^((this is football, not about country opinions. good football banter is not bad and its also not personal)) [deleted] Where have I said I'm defending a mistake? I didn't state that part because it's obvious. Of course it's a foul and it should've been a free kick for Czechia. All that I'm saying is that our chances of scoring didn't grow hugely because we got given a goal kick. I completely agree. Cheating and persistent fouling may constitute such a description, but playing with a low-block is not only valid but *equally* valid to any other strategy. They're under no obligation to hit quotas on shots, possession or any other stat than goals. And they very nearly succeeded. Idgaf about Portugal. I give a fuck about fairness. And that was a clear foul. It should have been given a free kick. No matter the country I mean that‚Äôs why in my original post I said they didn‚Äôt help themselves by pretty much gifting both goals. It‚Äôs like people choose not to read sometimes. That's why people are annoyed though as this was blatant, he goes into the path of the attacker with a full push and given it's position on the field it should have been an easy call.  As an England fan I totally get the notion of ott hate in this sub and people making mountains out of mole hills. Plus the general people that can only see decisions one way.  But on this one I truly struggle to see why it wasn't given.  At the same time the game reset and Czechs should have defended better.  I think it's also about how poor you guys were in the final third and the jammy nature of the goals. No team would have challenged that call at that point of time. If teams are allowed to challenge the past challenges when the goals do occur, then how far could they back to challenge call? before the ball went out? in that case, they would not have been able to challenge this call anyways since the goal kick started new sequence of play. That sounds fair  Perhaps do it in a way (like I think American football does it) where you get your challenge back if you where successful?  Should be limited to 2 per game at maximum though Yeah makes sense.  Still a bullshit situation not to see such a blatant foul seems like ref was looking elsewhere at that moment but side judge or fourth ref should have been able to see it. I was so heartbroken! It was the first Euros I really followed and I was so convinced Portugal was going to go all the way! Going out that way was so harsh! Okay so if Felix isn't a winger, is Leao a winger? typing error implies it was accidental, which is not true. in colloquial speech (and depending on the region) a final weak e can be added to the end of verbs You don't know that. The play was reset, it was a goal kick and the ref even checked the player. By all we know the goal would have happened anyway.  The only facts are: 1) it was a foul, yes 2) 2nd goal wasn't scored from that play, so it doesn't matter. The fould didnt impact the goal play at all. People acting like Portugal didn't have 80% possession at some point and that Czezhia would retain the ball for the rest of the extra time. Not that I'm arguing that it wasn't a blatant foul, but by that logic everything that happens after a bad call would be questioned. Germany won 5-1? Well, there was a wrongly called throw-in while the game was 0-0, so that's the reason.  It was a wrong call, but the goal didn't happen *because* of it, rather *after* it. What matters at the end is the result and Portugal won Its not worth it, the agenda against bruno is insane Maybe it's because Portuguese looks enough like spanish for me to understand it written down, but sounds absolutely nothing like it. Why you gotta do that to me. Uncalled foul, Portugal keeps the ball, develops along the side and scores. Had the foul been called, Portugal wouldn't have kept the ball, breaking the chain By that logic, then every game should be stopped after a badly called throw-in, it wouldn't matter.  Yes, it was a foul. No it didn't have any impact whatsoever on this play. It happened 2 mins before, and that defensive fuck-up didn't happen because Semedo tackled a Czech player. Of course. Because what we have more is people protesting a random foul that has nothing to do with goal. One of this days they are going to protest foul in the first half with goal on the second. This happens a lot for sure. Give me a break. It's not a penalty or a decisive foul in any meaning, but it's Portugal so let's call a robbery. üò¢üò¢Oooooh so true!!! You wouldn‚Äôt challenge to get an attacking ¬†free kick for your team instead of giving possession back to the opponent, deep into extra time? ¬†That feels like a pretty big swing to me, and definitely worth a challenge.  How exactly the timing of challenges would work is definitely a real issue though, I think you‚Äôd have to say that challenges could only happen in dead-ball situations and would have to be resolved before play started again. It was a typing error. The goal was scored directly from Portugal's possession after getting the goal kick  If a foul was given, Czechia would have had possession‚Äîthat absolutely changes the game, TBH  It's what it's tho Oh sorry, we all forgot that this game isn't about scoring goals but having the most posession That's a gross oversimplification and you know it. It‚Äôs not really an agenda. His studs make contact to Soucek‚Äôs face and he claims he did nothing wrong. It‚Äôs a stonewall yellow card every single time. Maybe, but at least we dont take orders from Madrid, like some take from London  (you started it, i didnt want to) What do you mean it has nothing to do with a foul when the goal happened right on the next portugal attack? It seemed big in hindsight because of the goal. It's not like it was in a direct free-kick range or a close free kick range. It was a foul that ref missed without the hindsight context. And you think the czechs would have still any challenges left at the 90 minute in a game they even got VAR to overturn a goal? They'd have likely used them by 91 minutes, in extra time.   Try giving credit instead of finding blame minutes in the past using rules that don't exist Yes its a typing error done on purpose, sort of a meme sentence, coming from Jorge Jesus Given what happened during the rest of the game, Czechia would've lost possession immediately anyway. No you're right, thats why we won How is it any less of a reach to claim that Semedo's tackle 2 min before had any impact on the play? The game moved on, it was a different play completely. Idk what this is in relation to unless it's because I posted in r/Scotland? But I'm not sure all of Spain wants to take orders from Madrid üòÇ. Right next, really it was literally right next? So if one more minute past it was ok? Lol. If Portugal shots and fails and then there's a corner and is goal it's ok? How ridiculous this is... It was a foul on the other side of a pitch like any other foul, that happens in the game. Did not affect the goal in any way, but ok whatever. Go ahead. Cancelo suffers a foul that referee did not give and 5 minutes after that Czechia score, was that ok? Lol... Maybe you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ I feel like keeping vs losing a possession that near the end of a tied match could be pretty significant to the outcome, so I‚Äôd want that free kick for sure, but that‚Äôs just supposition on my part, not based on evidence or analysis Thanks for explaining, thought it was a mistake It's a different scenario building up a goal from a goal kick vs winning it back off a Czech free kick   It's what it's tho. Czechia deserved to lose for how bad they played today IMO See above. I understand what you're getting at, but there is a massive difference between the rest of the game and the final two minutes where Portugal is throwing all the pressure on the goal. It's huge for an exhausted, defending team to get the ball out of their third and even bigger to win a free kick to slow things down in the opponents third. I would bet money that the game would have finished a draw had that foul been called.¬†   With that said, refs are going to miss fouls and you're right that Czechia can't blame the loss on a missed call.¬† Very speculative to claim that FK would have ended the match, considering there were 4 minutes left to play, and Czechia barely held to possession throughout the whole match. Even if it had been called, the likelihood of them holding possession for long was low, they at 26% (!) the whole match, it was very one-sided on that regard, and they spent most of the time in their own third.  So yeah, I'm very skeptical that they'd avoid Portugal getting the ball forward with 4 minutes left to play on the clock. It was not whether we'd regain possession and push forward, it was whether we could do something with it upfront."

The craziest part is that's not even prime Lewandowski. There are still people arguing about his signing Look at that scrub Messi down in 10th. No way that guy will ever score close to a 100 goals in a calendar year. ‚ÄúFather, tell me about 2015/2016 Luis Suarez‚Äù Eto'o's numbers are insane considering that era Being on Eto'o numbers at his age, considering the Bar√ßa he joined is crazy. Certainly one of the best (if not the best) striker of his generation and one of the best of all time. messi is a fraud smh my head Look at Messi so mid His start to the season has been such an improvement over last season. r/bottomleftmessi  /s Suarez 88 goals from 100 games is absolutely obscene, as hated as he was he's gotta go down as one of the best to step on the pitch suarez is insane bro wtf was Suarez eating in Barcelona? lol Eto and Suarez were two beasts. I wonder how well Covid Lewa would've done at Barca I'm honestly more surprised he's played 100 matches for them already The crazy thing about this is that this is old man Lewandowski vs young Neymar, young Eto'o and young Suarez. He's doing this in his late 30s.  And Messi did it at 19 or something, which is also crazy My argument here is that only three on that list were there ""in their prime"" and that is Kluivert, Villa and Suarez.   Kluivert was such a huge name back then1995-2001 he was one of the toptoptop strikers but faded. But still in that era 0,5 goals per game was considered elite. Villa was arguably the best striker in europe then he signed from Valencia. Suarez was probably robbed of a Balon dOr somehwere there too, he is one of the most complete attackers I've ever seen.   Pedro and Messi were coming through as subs and young kids that were deferring the load of carrying games to R10, Villa, Henry, Etoo etc. Their record is impressive as hell considering that.   Ronaldinho came in as a bit of an ""unknown"" because there were doubts of his consistency although he was instantly a star player. But 40+ goals from the wing is crazy (15-20 league goals per season) when Freddie Ljungberg scored 12 goals as a winger was a EPL record for his time :D  Henry was already declining. Not bad by any means but still declining, same could be said of Lewa. Neymar came out of Santos and was lucky to play with prime Messi and Suarez.   Etoo came aged 23 and was amazing from the start. And still improving basically with every year. That is actually insane. Prime lewy is in the conversation for the best STs of all time. R9 would be top 6 in that list in just 49 games. I don't think people understand just how insane of a stat Suarez's is. Generally speaking Ronaldo's first 100 games at Real Madrid, Juventus and Haaland's first 100 games at City are often spoken about when it comes to hitting the ground running.   First 100 Games   Real Madrid Ronaldo - 95 goals, 29 assists - 124 G/A    Juventus Ronaldo - 85 goals and 20 assists - 105 G/A    Manchester City Haaland - 91 Goals, 14 assists - 105 G/A      Barcelona Suarez- 88 goals, 43 assists - 131 G/A. These are monstrous stats. Considering this 100 game period involved 1) Back to back leagues  and copa 2) winning UCL and treble back with a goal in the final 3) Some incredible goals against Real Madrid, Atleti, PSG. Gotta be the most explosive start to a club career.   Ofcourse in the long run- Ronaldo overtakes that, but suarez sits comfortably second with Haaland right at his heels. Those are really good numbers for Lewandowski wow. Insane how much disrespect lewa gets¬† Best striker of the last 20+ years. Su√°rez with almost 1 goal per game while also probably having the best assist to games ratio here lol Most disrespected forward of our time Damn Suarez popped off For the older folks here, how come Messi scored so little after 100 games? When did he really start popping off? Scary how good Suarez was. One of the all time greats. I mean, look at those Suarez numbers. He was just an absolute beast with a peak performance squad around him, my god Wow this Messi guy seemed super weak in comparison. Did he ever make it? In my opinion, he's the best striker of this generation. Suarez scored in empty nets after Ney and messi passes. Lewa was playing in a most weak squad of Barca in 21 century So, do we all agree that Su√°rez was the best 9 of our generation? Are the ""incidents"" going to eclipse the career of one of the best center-forwards of all time? For the first time, Messi is at the bottom. He ain‚Äôt the GOAT I‚Äôm afraid. Bruh wtf was Messi doing I think that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen a chart where Messi is not at the top of it lol Messi is quite surprising rare bottom left messi? Messi is absolutely finished And keep in mind that he could have scored so many more in the year where nobody could give an actual good pass/cross or where certain players went for own success too many times (ferran, raphinha, fati and yamal). Prime Suarez at Barcelona playing with Messi and Neymar 0.699 goals per game.   Washed Lewandowski at Barcelona playing with no name kids 0.710 goals per game.   Think about it. Didn't expect Kluivert to be so high in the ranking, to be fair The best player ever to not been rewarded a Ballon D‚Äôor Suarez one of the most underappreciated strikers in history. Remembered for biting than his talents. What is a murderer doing here? For comparison, Haaland just hit 100 games for us a month ago, on 91 goals. Can Barca please just fall off for once üòí Another weird and useless stat no one asked for. He‚Äôd have 70+ if he was in his prime and had better service like Eto‚Äôo and Suarez I dont get how tf is messi down there People don't really have a problem with his numbers. It's his overall game that people didn't like in previous seasons.  But yeah I guess you could argue numbers are all that matter for a striker. Even if isn‚Äôt in his prime and have no resell value, it‚Äôs absolute steal to get a player with those stats for 50m. I believe he has 20+ assists on top of those goals. The amount of criticism he gets, and people saying he should be benched/sold, or that Roque should have been playing over him. It's mind boggling.  Again, as you note, doesn't have nearly the support cast/environment the top 2 had, and sits above so many legends of the team.  Wild. Expectations are just ridiculous when you go to madrid/barcelona He‚Äôs slays been criticized for 2 things tbh - his link up play and big matches - but I get the feeling it was more due to Xavi‚Äôs system where the forwards are isolated He is a bit like Henry was. People dont argue about his signing, people argue about his salary. Luis Suarez was earning half of it. It's   Value for money vs current club finances vs his age vs his contract and % increase every year.  It's not worth it.  Also, regardless Barca isn't winning anything Rare bottom left messi Messi who? I know we're joking around, but Messi's stats look REALLY good here when you consider that he's an academy product that debuted at 16 while everyone else on this list except Pedro came in as a 20 something year old (30 something for Lewandowski) with plenty of experience in other clubs. Imagine if one day he would be the top goal scorer for the club üòÇüòÇüòÇ can‚Äôt even imagine his bozo ahh could do it > No way that guy will ever score close to a 100 goals in a calendar year.  You can say that about anyone shudder thinking about that trio, hell even the trio on the other side was also crazy BTW Suarez scored 198 goals and gave 109 assists for Barcelone in... 283 games. Truly insane player. Dearly missed and a shame how he was treated at the end. He would've won the Ballon d'Or if he didn't have bad PR best player in a trio that has Messi and Neymar, he was insane He was also incredible for Mallorca he was amazing. a beauty to watch. Everton legend Consistency for sure lewa but prime nothing beats suarez Suarez above every other #9 for me save for the obvious one, R9. If not. smh shaking my head shaking my head my head? Mid is accurate. He was a midfilder for his initual years. In an era when midfielder didn't go forward as often. 41 goals in 100 games is insane stats for that era. I thought he was very good for most of second half last season Call that the Flick effect Probably has something to do with Lamine and Pedri contributing assists, and not Concelo and Jao Felix ball-watching I think Xavi misplaced the shit out of him. He has been great for the past half a year Suarez scored 198 goals and gave 109 assists for Barcelone in... 283 games Nah. He just had anger issues sometimes.    Good player though. Dude went his first eight games without scoring. Also became extremely selfless. Once he assisted Messi on the goal line instead of kicking the ball into the empty net. The opponents He was insane for them. His finishing was incredible from anywhere. at barca during covid era or covid lewy in current barca. If its the first one he would have been shit along with the rest of the team. You should not be. If you watched his career closely you would know, dude is obsessed about health, not just fitness, and so is his karate wife. He had been one of least injury prone footballer for a long time. Highly undervalued and under-discussed issue. There's a lot players can do not to get injured, and most do not do much. Water is wet. Lewy overall is in that conversation. no way Ppl don't talk more about Suarez stats because he joined one of the best duo to ever exist in modern football, Neymar and Messi was clicking extremely well and a lot of Suarez goals were products of Messi or Neymar.  He was always unfairly rated, even on awards talk his name was only briefly mentioned. Is he? He‚Äôs super loved and any fan with half decent knowledge knows he‚Äôs top tier player it‚Äôs just striker is a very competitive position insane players he‚Äôs competing with We loved him and is my favourite player. He does deserve so much more respect and recognition imo. Really? Isn't he considered top 2 of his generation? Suarez being the other one. Because he was a teenager and the new kid on the block. Plus he was a CAM/Winger, not the main striker.  The ones at the top of that list came in already made at other clubs. He was not the focal point of the team until 2008 and also not a gala 11 player for most of his first two seasons. Ahead of Suarez? Noooo After Su√°rez LMAO  https://youtu.be/NIFJVCDDG4s?si=_Xl-3_WWuWyWq6LX Why tf do you want Madrid to not fall off? By being very young in his first 100 games and by having many games where he didn't start.   100 matches means very little if 1 person played 90 minutes all those 100 games (as an example). While the other played only 20 minutes in half of them(as an example). He made his first appearance when he was 17 lmao, its hardly surprising, if anything its shocking he even made it to this list. He wasn‚Äôt given very big minutes early on, but was subbed on late. Those drove up his games played stat. He was like‚Ä¶ 20? And playing as a winger in a very stacked team at the time. Roni was still there that season I think. Also, Pedro is really going to go down as one of our most underrated players. Guy could play on the right side of left. Would take that dude now and put him on our starting 11 they should've added age beside the names. some of these players joined the club in their prime (like Suarez), some started young (like Messi) and others joined in their mid-30s (like lewandowski). He played as winger, AND he wasn't accurate finishing back then. Also kinda more selfish, sometimes overlooking easy choices, and rather overdoing ... although he had an insane dribbling already and I knew he was something else, i never thought he was gonna be a good scorer. First two seasons he wasnt a starter and ""only"" scored 9 goals in 34 games You shouldn't argue that, because it's not true.  It's just that Lewandowski had a really bad year at Barcelona, but his first year was really good, and he is actually better now. Yeah the argument is so tiring. I mean it's a part of the job to score goals, but it just feels like someone is too cool to be remotely interested in football to talk about nothing else and just shut everything down with ""the guy playing 9 for FC Barcelona is scoring goals in La Liga!!! You cannot criticize him!"". He is criticized by fans who watch the game for various aspects, and some here act so high and might like being interested in football at all is below their level, they're here just for the adult stuff and numbers lol.  Whether overall he was good enough or bad enough last season, that's another dispute. I think the consensus would be that he had a decent season. He is the best paid striker in Europe. Barcelona isn‚Äôt in its current position for making great deals. > it‚Äôs absolute steal to get a player with those stats for 50m  The fee was never the issue and it would be a stretch to call him a steal even if we ignore his wages. 63 goals in 100 games is a fine return. But he's the best paid striker in Europe by some distance right now. He's costing Barcelona a sum they can barely afford and having come off a 50 goal year for Bayern, has absolutely underperformed on what Barcelona expected.   You cannot ignore that fact he's on over 600k a week this season and has just come off a year where he scored 19 league goals and finished miles behind Madrid. Problem for Bar√ßa are his wages, not the signing fee. Also, despite putting out good numbers, if you actually watch the games from the last season, he actually still missed a lot of chances and messed up quite a bit. That said, I still feel like that was due to many factors and got better over time. The coach, his confidence, how the team played in general, etc. So I think that he will do better this season than the last. For 600k a week they should be. No one expects this from every player going to barca/Madrid. It's literally lewandoski who scored 110 + goals in his last 100 bayern games that is held to such a standard. Except for all the trophies barca won with him, of course. Cuccitini Andre Messi Pionel It's ridiculous Messi had already that many goals considerig he would be only 20-21 in his 100th match. > while everyone else on this list except Pedro   Out of all of these the one I'm most surprised about is actually Pedro. Really underrated player. (You made me look. Not only he tops the chart, he has more goals than the next three players put together) *Kisses thre fingers* ""Sit down son, let me tell you about the man we called El Pistolero"" Bale, Benzema and Cristiano was very nice, but after 2016, those 3 very rarely were on the team sheet together. It was a lot of Benzema and Cristiano and then sometimes Ronaldo and Bale. yea the guy that won it was a real fraud Maybe he would have had a chance if Ronaldo missed at least one between the Champions League and the Euros, because in that edition he won with one of the highest advantages ever (and I don't think he deserved such a big margin) Lmao he was not better than Messi Sadly not for real madrid It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. I‚Äôd take prime Lewa in CL over prime Suarez any day tbh. Suarez has weirdly poor stats in CL. I mean Suarez has been as consistent his entire career and yes I‚Äôm bias but for me Suarez was ahead of Lewandowski I just feel he had the goals but also was just a better all round player. If youre talking just from this list and only playing for Barca, then.. no actually, Eto‚Äôo was better for Barca. Peak Suarez was in Liverpool, and even then, that peak Suarez didnt hold a candle to Ronaldo Nazario. Tbh honest There is always someone hahaha He wasn't a midfielder, he was a wide player and also a teenager for most of these games¬† He had some great dummy/leave-the-ball assist play. Yeah you're right, I forgot Barca really struggled during that time, still think a player as good as Lewa would be able to set his marks even if he played there. I think he's talking about the utter nonsense people like to spill, such as ""he did it in a farmers league"", whilst having the 3rd most UCL goals of all time lmao You‚Äôd be surprised by the amount of people who say ‚Äòfarmers league tax‚Äô or ‚ÄòBayern tax‚Äô about Lewa‚Äôs career, they‚Äôll talk about how good the Bayern teams he was on were without mentioning who the best player was on the majority of them. Considering he would have won the vote for Ballon d'or in 2020 if not for Covid procedure from UEFA then yes. Madrid fans have been trying to insert Benzema into it because of his well deserved Ballon d or. But they forget he had 1 season as good as Lewandoski had 4 or 5. He was barcas best player at 19, it's just he was a wide player and a teenager for most of these games. You need to actually go watch him play from that time rather than look at goal stats, plus football was more balanced than it is nowadays back then. Prime Suarez was bether. No doubt about that. But still would take Lewa over Suarez because he can guarantee 30+ goals each season. Prime suarez, sure. But I am still taking lewy over his entire career also for his performance in the biggest club competition in football Arguably yeah Higher peak for Suarez but Lewa been better over a longer period, depends which you prefer tbh. Nah not really Was shocked to see Pedro here. Yeah, the talent was too immense on that team and Pedro consistently considered ""not good enough"" or just didn't have that same crazy level. But the man was really good. I agree ‚Äî one of our most underrated players. yeah, that was the most obvious thing that jumped out to me. Barca in general had a bad year with goal scoring. Nobody else got double digits. Is he really paid more than Haaland or Mbapp√©?   He's on slightly more than 20m a year which is a lot, but I find it very hard to believe Haaland and especially Mbapp√© is on less than that Their own fault for expecting an aging legend to put up ludicrous numbers in a different league He is a steal. People often forget that the clubs like Barca and Madrid who have a global fanbase, it's not just a sporting aspect but also marketing goals when it comes to signings. Once Messi left, Barca needed a superstar this is the reason Laporta took so much effort to bring him in. He came off a top 3 itw Bayern. Barca just hasn't provided him with the same quality of service up until now. And also bayern were tailored to play around him as their main man for 6-7 years. Which barca aren't. Add to that he's 3 years older, 35 and in a new league with a new style of football and a completely new environment. 63 goals and 20 assists in 100 games, including a first season pichichi beating benzema who came off a Ballon d or. Haaland, Kane and Mbappe are the only strikers in the world who are performing better than him. And they're all paid more than him iirc? Agreed, but it's easier to score in Bundesliga. Also, Bayern were a much better team than Barca, and age. Yes, he has maybe underperformed with Barca, but not that much. My only complaint is the game vs Bayern (away) he missed 2-3 chances which he would always score. Why would the player be rated by what's the club offered him, rather than what's he's presenting on field? Shhh, those don't count. Piatek? You mean gladly? What about ""against"" Real Madrid? Fortunately * Su√°rez has been consistently fantastic throughout his entire career Suarez hasn't played that many CL games Then by definition if you‚Äôre judging him on his poor stats you aren‚Äôt judging prime Suarez The irony in picking Lewa for his CL numbers, when his whole career has mostly been defined by disappearing in big CL games. His 4-goal game against Real Madrid was literally his peak in the CL.   Not being a big game player was his reputation with Bayern throughout his career. Lewa will score 99% of his goals in the group stages and then disappear.   I'd pick Suarez over any striker (except maybe Benzema, but Benzema was not as dominant of a striker as Suarez for more than a couple of seasons). Haaland has more CL goals than Suarez R9 was amazing but not as amazing as messi or cr7, suarez was the only player to dethrone messi and cr7 in goals on their prime. R9 couldve been better but he had shit work ethic and injuries fucked him over. Prime suarez is the best 9 ever. rip in peace Wide forwards weren't really a thing until the 2005/2006 (and Messi and Ronaldo were two of the OG for the modern era). Wingers did exist but they were again, people who played well back of the CF (usually two). üîù its kind of the same point tho. Being in bayern for 8 years makes you be n¬∫1 seed in groups for 8 years, thus easily advancing to quarterfinals, so a lot more games too Yeh there was ways that discourse but like he did at every level against all types of opposition, still remember that hattrick vs Madrid insane  player Bro I watched him play during those years too. I know he was great. All I am saying is that the team was built around Ronaldinho until 2008 and he alternated playing time with Giuly in his first years. Also his focus was not on being the main goal scorer of the team. The 2nd youngest on this is pedro who was 4 years older than messi when he made his first appearance, so yes it is pretty amazing he is even on this list. What are you talking about, nobody at the time considered Pedrito to not be good enough? He was an absolute key player from 2009 up until circa 2014. It wasn't until Luisito arrived that he was displaced from the starting lineup. Mbapp√© is the second-best paid player in the Spanish league, slightly behind Frenkie de Jong (who IIRC still has a Bartomeu-era salary in his contract). On paper mbappe is paid less.  Around 250k a week, but has 30m loyalty bonus or something every season He has a rising contract, AS says that this season his contract jumps to 32-33 million.   They are Barcelona, they were probably hoping that next year they will have higher revenue and it will not be a problem. And, hey, they're not bankrupt officially so maybe it was the way to get there, what do I know. I absolutely believe that that's more than City say they're paying Haaland This right here. Makes it hard to have any sympathy for them. I do not think they expected 40 goals considering the \~1.5 million (might be 1.25, do not remember)  they have to pay to Bayern when he crosses 25 total per season. I mean, it's just an imagination of an oline commenter what Barcelona ""expected"". I don't think they expected to sign prime Lewandowski. If you had a player that's guaranteed to play like prime Lewandowski for many years to come, the fee is not 50 million euro lol.  The contract they gave him is totally crazy, but that can (in some proportion) be said about several players. They've been desperate to maintain their position as without it, they're gonna lose a lot of revenue, and signing a big star that plays well was something I can aaalmost understand as a way to try for that. Without a strong offer, they probably don't get such a player. There are few of them that ever leave their club, and Lewandowski was not conflicted with Bayern without a reason, he wanted to be appreciated with a strong contract (and I'm sure Bayern's offer was not small at all).  They really lacked some star to be the face of the club. Defenders don't really become that. De Jong is... controversial. Goals are goals, and nobody in Barcelona scored close to half as many as Lewandowski. Who's the offensive star at the moment they were signing him? Dembele was rarely in form at the moment, Raphina was just ok... A more defensive one, no less. Absolutely this. Madrid's Galacticos v1 won basically nothing and is still considered a success by the board due to the amount of brand work that it did for them. Hence why they chased Mbappe for so long - him, Haaland, Bellingham and likely Lamine (post Euros) are set to become the biggest superstars of the next gen just in terms of their brand value.   Lewa is an established superstar and in particular has a massive following in Eastern Europe, which helps their global appeal. Probably the biggest ever from that region - Yashin and Sheva were from different time periods. A good example is Son - he's probably the biggest celebrity alive in Korea, bigger than any single K-Pop member even. And the amount of Koreans with Spurs 'Son' merch is crazy. Barca does not need Superstars. The club itself will always attract players. Lewandowski is currently on about 650k a week. That makes him the top paid striker in Europe by some distance. I suspect Mbappe earns more but early sources suggested he's on similar money to Madrid's top earners. Because it's football and it's supposed to be a meritocracy? Whether right or wrong, of course fans expect the highest paid players to be the best performing players. Pio Pio üî• Suarez scored 198 goals and gave 109 assists for Barcelone in... 283 games No he hasn't, he had a few good years and that's about it. Never was that consistent. never said he did. his goal ratio is mediocre as well. I feel like people have short memory because I distinctly remember Bar√ßa fans wanted him out circa 2019/2020 because of his terrible CL goal record. His goal ratio is still very bad Except that period was his prime considering how he out scored Messi and CR7 in the league. His CL record is just poor overall. He had very poor UCL stats throughout his career. What part of it do you want to cut and call his prime? Because it wouldn't matter when you'll compare it to Lewandoski who was going close to 2 g/a per game in the UCL during his prime. If we are actually talking *peak* and not longevity, then me and Mourinho heavily disagree with you. Ronaldo from the age of 19-21 when he didnt suffer from injury of weight problems was the no.1 best player in history, nobody has dominated a football field as much as that utter beast. He had the same, or arguably better, ability as Messi, where you just gave him the ball in the middle of the field and let him run all the way to goal by himself.   Messi and Ronaldo is just recency bias and longevity, not peak performance. I‚Äôm taking Henry over Suarez if you consider him a number 9 The more games argument is moot because his ratio for goals per game and g/a per game in both UCL matches overall as well as UCL knockouts is sandwiched between messi and Ronaldo and at times even above them both. The fact that he played more games and still maintained that ratio shows how much better he was compared to every one else. Messi and Ronaldo did it for even longer ofcourse, but lewandoski just absolutely clears everyone else in any conceivable stat. Including Suarez and Benzema. And Messi and Ronaldo too had the same seeding and quality of team around them as him. After 2006 he was the best player on the team until he left, his first proper season was 05/06 where he got injured and did alternate a bit with giuly as you said but he was 18 lol. Emm nah ive seen better I am pretty sure de Jong's contract appears inflated because of the amount of money Barcelona still owes him. We're going to have to start talking ""Total Comp"" when discussing players' wages, the industry is changing. Don't think I've ever had to find a tinier violin than the one I play for Barcelona's misfortunes. Same reason why PSG would never seek Lee Kang-In You really think that ""region"" matters and fans from Ukraine or Hungary care so much more about Lewandowski compared to Messi or Ronaldo because he's from the ""region""? Do German fans start following clubs where Dutch players go? Looking on the jerseys on the streets, I'd say Lewandowski has fans all over the world, and Barcelona being extremely globally popular probably does its part. to play for free? lol you still need to pay them superstar wages Barca need a superstar to attract the global fanbase. There are more and more younger generation kids starting to watch football and they are not gonna be Barca fans because they are gonna watch videos of old matches in the pep era. I have seen many saying they chose Barca as their club because of Dinho. Is this not an increased wage for just this year? Were his wages the last two years also so much? Is his total 4 year earning at Barcelona more than those of Kane, Haaland, Mbappe? Because I believe his average wage per season shouldnt be much above them if at all. But that's rating how your club is run, the performance should always be rated as performance. It's not players fault that someone overpaid them. The guy was a genuine menace for half a season and simply dissappeared into oblivion That wanting out started in the first half of 17/18 - until he shaved that is. I guess it depends on what you consider a prime. I conceptualise comparing primes personally as effectively comparing how good they were on their day in a one off isolated sense rather than how good they were over a period of time. I think Suarez has a million more strings to his bow than Lewy in that regard, he is a better linkup player, stronger than Lewy, faster than him, better at dribbling, better range of shots to his game, debatably generally a better finisher too. I think there is a lot of revisionism happening with Lewandowksi right now because of how he is still around and Suarez isn‚Äôt. When he won the title with us every single person around here was saying he was unquestionably the best striker of his generation. Recency bias and longevity? Messi scored 91 goals in a calendar year, and thats one example cuz i could give you more than a whole hand full of examples from him, cr7 in 2017?  Literally the best primes of all time. Not peak performance??? Lol. I would have him as more consistent, henry at arsenal and bar√ßa was always amazing. An injury prone 17-20 year old playing sparingly having figures that were roughly comparable to Prime Ronaldinho and Villa and Henry (who were each top 3/5 forwards in the world at the time they signed for Barca) is extremely good. Even more so when you consider he wasn't particularly clinical at the time Better 17 year olds? What pray tell is your better 17 year old than 41 goals in 100 games from mostly sub appearances competing against the likes of etoo, Ronaldinho, and Henry for places in the front three. In one of the most competitive leagues in the world. Yeah it does actually make a difference. A kid growing up in Poland might be equally likely to idolise Lewa, CR7 and Messi. That leads to not only brand value and merch sales, but also talented youth being more likely to work and eventually join their idol's club. And 'similar to Messi/CR7' is not at all a snub. They're once-in-history talents and in 15 years when nostalgia glasses set in they'll be seen in the same light as Gretzky and Phelps.   Never said that Lewa/Barca don't have global appeal, but their appeal is in fact greater in areas where there have been a dearth of stars. See Son as an example of that. He's considered the GOAT of Asian footballers and Korea's single biggest celebrity. And he's an amazing baller but just one of many amazing ballers of his gen technically. No other club in Europe would've offered them the kind of salaries Barca was giving out.  You'd expect PSG/City to do that because of the lack of prestige they have His wages were structured weirld to get around registering him, but he is paid as well as Haaland/Mbappe on average for sure. Probably bit more. You do know that clubs have a finite amount of money and of course if you spend 15% of your allowed budget at one player, it's a sacrifice of not signing anybody else in the world in that place? Or 5 other guys, sometimes? It's a choice, not everyone gets to play for Barcelona.  Of course Lewandowski is better at football than most humans on the planet, but why could anyone care about that? The expectations from him are based on context of what HE is, where HE plays, not on some abstract idea of everyone being the same. If you go to a hotel and it's just a pile of trash, you don't think ""well it's the same as the street outside, I cannot be critical about the fact that I overpaid for it"".  You can say he didn't meet expectations, or not, that's arguable, but of course expectations for Lewandowski are pretty high. True. He was just never able to replicate his league form in the CL. He was a big reason bar√ßa struggled in those away games tbh. Hey man, I personally believe Suarez was the more talented player. Rather the most talented forward after messi/ronaldo. But greatness is where I put him on number 2 ( compared to lewy). Lewandoski has had his moments of individual brilliance too, including two of the most iconic ones in modern football history, 5 goals in 9 mins and 4 goals against Madrid. Yes Suarez was a more complete player, no doubt about it, but lewandoski just left him behind in legacy during his last 3 bayern seasons. 25 g/a in 9 or 10 games in the UCL when he led bayern to the sextuple, 69 goals in a single calender year that too when he was injured, 41 league goals in 29 games, back to back fifa the best wins and so on. It's not revisionist to say Lewandoski will be regarded as the better player, because any player is defined by how good they were over a period of time. That's the most authentic metric you can measure greatness by. Suarez was more talented no doubt about it, but lewandoski ended up being the greater player. There's a difference. 16 penalties and 22 friendly goals in that season, and played a lot more minutes than Ronaldo, who had 0 penalty goals. Ronaldo had 47 non-penalty goald in 49 matches, and a lot of those goals he made completely by himself.   Messi is close, but no cigar. Go call Mourinho and tell him ‚Äúlol‚Äù at his own opinion that Ronaldo was the best player in history. I would pay good money to see Mourinho‚Äôs reaction to that lmao Giuly who he was directly competing with in his first season captained Monaco to a CL final before joining too. Poland, sure. But ""region""? I don't know how people in Iran, Indonesia or Siberia think about Son, maybe they care, hard for me to say, but I know for sure how people in Europe think about it. Do German fans start following clubs where Dutch players go? Simple question. I don't think he had an away goal in the Champions League for 3 years or something. The top scorers in that period were Messi, Own Goals then someone like Neymar who had been gone for 2 years. Also, I'd say that there is an argument for Lewy being the most consistent striker of all time. Most of the greatest strikers of all time miss that consistency like R9, Van Basten, Romario (not on Lewy's level in consistency considering leagues too), etc.       Gerd Muller is on that list too but I think Lewy is straight up a better player than him from footage I've seen of Muller and how people who watched Muller talk about him. Lewy has never had a season like Luis in 15/16. Luis has almost won the prem dragging fucking disgracefully bad Liverpool team to second, he completely revolutionised Atletico and won us the league title immediately. I appreciate your response and I understand where you‚Äôre coming from but I just flat out disagree, I think you‚Äôre placing too much weight on his recent seasons. I will be interested to see how these opinions age once he has retired. Have a good night sir :) You are like those women that wont suck your balls because when you were shaving them you missed one hair. When messi misses the penalties he is a fraud, when he scores he is a penalty merchant. Mourinho has his own opinion, everyone is entitled to one, so go cry somewhere else because someone has a different opinion than urs. If you need someone elses opinion to validate yours then seek therapy because thats just weak mentality when you cant find arguments to validate your own. I couldve mentioned klopp, henry, wenger, and many others to validate my opinion so whatever makes you feel better brother. You're correct maybe he didn't, but he did have an almost equally impressive season in a completely different style ( the one after bayern's UCL win ) where he was going at 1.3 goals per game at par with what messi had put up in 2012. And then his second best, third best and fourth best seasons were also so much better than Suarez. You could argue again for Suarez' liverpool season. But it's just a fact that over his career, lewy outshadowed him far too much. Not with talent, but with his output. After reading half of your first sentence its clear to me that youre just a child, so i have lost interest in engaging with you any further. Have a nice day and do try to be nicer to people Also, Suarez didn‚Äôt always take penalties whilst Robert always has, as a side note. What are their non penalty numbers? Not sure but iirc he's still easily 3rd behind only messi/Ronaldo for per game stats without penalties. I apologise but I am inclined to not trust that is true That is fine. Suarez has scored 54 penalties out of 68 and lewandoski has scored 82 out of 91 over their careers. Suarez has 752 g/a in his career at a pace of 1 g/a per 86 mins. Taking out penalties he is involved in 1 goal every 92 mins. Lewandoski has 726 g/a in his career at a pace of  1 g/a every 87 mins. Without penalties it becomes  1 every 99 mins. My source is transfer market.    So yes Suarez is slightly better when discarding penalty goals and also very very slightly better ( basically identical ) over his career at g/a per game.    Two important things, you shouldn't just discard penalty goals, important part of the game, especially for a striker, and especially considering the fact that Suarez has a much worse conversion rate than Lewandoski. And second, these are for their entire careers, for just the top European clubs ( athletico barca liverpool ajax and dorrmund bayern barca ) , they're both basically identical again with 0.97 per game. Couldn't fund per min stats for these.    They aren't as separable as you believe, and it is 'only' assists that put Suarez on par. As a a pure and pure striker, lewandoski blows him out of the park for just goals, even without his penalty goals.  Again, I believe Suarez is the better player, but lewandoskis legacy in the biggest club competition ( the UCL ) renders him the greater player. Said ‚Äúathletico‚Äù, opinion invalid Also you say that I shouldn‚Äôt discard penalty goals whilst you earlier discarded the fact that Lewandoski is inferior to Suarez in every other faculty of his game, which is a worse thing to discard do you think? lewandoski is superior to Suarez in the one main thing he's supposed to be superior in. Suarez is so much worse at scoring goals thay everything else he does combined just about puts him at par with lewandoski. He has the second most number of assists in history and is one of the most prolific goal scorers and all of that combined just about levels his output with just lewandoskis goals. Both the things you mentioned aren't to be discarded, but this is some Nunez is a more complete player than haaland shit at this point, lewandoski is just so much ahead in goals that it doesn't matter for anything else. He simply wins you matches by just existing on the pitch. And not just that, he scores in the most important competition of all, his stellar scoring record shines in the UCL knockouts. Above everyone, even messi in goal per game stats. So I don't get what's so hard to comprehend. But he‚Äôs not brother you literally just proved they are on par for goal scoring. I cannot believe you just likened Lewy to Haaland and Suarez to Nunez. I can see you arbitrarily believe what you do so I am just gonna leave you be. again I keep saying I believe Suarez is the better player yet the one time I make an extreme comparison just to prove my point you catch on to it like that. Also, there seems to be an issue with your reading comprehension, they aren't on par for goal scoring at all, they're on par for goals + assists total. For just goals, like I said, lewandoski is very easily ahead. Should be obvious. Let's leave this conversation, lewandoski has his back to back fifa the best wins and sextuple. Suarez is a great in his own right, but lewy will be remembered even greater. I massively disagree. If nothing else too Suarez is much more of an entertainer, those are the ones that stand the test of time. People don‚Äôt rate Van Nistelrooy above Ronaldinho. Ultimately my friend, we are so incredibly biased in our opinions that we are effectively just having a conversation where I go ‚ÄúI am an Atl√©ti fan and I think my player is better because I love him‚Äù and vice versa for you. We shall see what happens in time! but people rate Gerd Muller. Not an entertainer, one of the greatest ever anyway. They rate lewandoski too same as gerd muller except for national team accomplishments. You just seem to have a thing for south American flair. Most Europeans don't have it, save for some Spaniards. It's a bias. And a very common one. Can't say I don't like watching it myself, doesn't change the fact that in an imp UCL knockout, when you need a goal, any one in the entire world puts lewandoski on the pitch and not Suarez. Indeed. Have a great day! You make some valid points, it‚Äôs hard to argue the UCL goal stats indeed, though I think in terms of football cultural impact, Suarez will be remembered more fondly for being part of MSN and battling for La Liga when competition was incomparably high, whilst Lewy will be remembered as the crowning jewel of a Bayern team which no one stood a chance against which may devalue his importance. Heck as soon as he left you guys still won the league with fucking Eric Chupo Moting up top. Angel Correa is better than Gerd Muller I shall, thank you for the spirited debate homie, hope life is treating you well Cheers! It is,  I hope the same for you. :)"

#üóíÔ∏è Match Events

- 1st Half Begins

**1'**|
The visitors kick us off and we are under way!

**2'**|
Saka swings an early corner in, but the delivery is poor and cleared by the first man. It's been a front-footed start from the visitors, however.

**5'**|
SAVE! The first shot on target of the game falls to Kulusevski after Son cuts the ball back to the Sweden international, though the shot from a tight angle is beaten behind for a corner by Raya.

**8'**|
There's another nervy moment for Arsenal as Kulusevski's whipped cross goes through a crowded box, somehow missing everybody. It could catch Raya out, but the Arsenal goalkeeper is alert to palm away from danger.

**15'**| üü®
William Saliba (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card.

**17'**|
CLOSE! Martinelli races past his man down the left before lofting a cross to the back post, where Havertz rises well to meet it. The forward powers a header goalwards, but Vicario does brilliantly to get down to his right to keep it out before his defenders scramble clear the danger.

**18'**|
ANOTHER SAVE! Arsenal get in down the left again, and Martinelli opts to shoot instead of laying it to his right for Saka. The left-winger looks to curl into the far corner with his right foot, but Vicario again comes up big for his team to keep his side level.

**27'**| üü®
Destiny Udogie (Tottenham Hotspur) is shown the yellow card 

**28'**|
JUST WIDE! Solanke is inches away from giving Spurs the lead as he gets on the end of Son's cross, though his header back across goal bounces just wide of the left post with Raya scrambling.

**30'**|
Half an hour on the clock, and both sides have certainly had chances to get their noses in front. The Gunners have so far edged proceedings according to expected goals (xG), creating 0.41 to Spurs' 0.14.


**32'**| üü®
Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham Hotspur) is shown the yellow card

**35'**|
HANDBAGS! It's all kicking off here as Timber and Vicario clash after the referee blows for a foul. The referee Jarred Gillett's first punitive measure sees Timber booked for the initial foul on Porro.

**35'**| üü®
Jurri√´n Timber (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.


**37'**| üü®
Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham Hotspur) is shown the yellow card.

**40'**| As we near the break, we remain goalless at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It's certainly been frantic, though, and you'd image both managers will be relatively pleased with how their teams have competed to this point.

**45+1'**|
As we move into three minutes of additional time at the end of this first half, Johnson blazes over the crossbar from a difficult angle.

**45'+2'**| üü®
Micky van de Ven (Tottenham Hotspur) is shown the yellow card.

**45'+2'**| üü®
Dejan Kulusevski (Tottenham Hotspur) is shown the yellow card.

**45'+4'**|
First Half ends, Tottenham Hotspur 0, Arsenal 0.

- 2nd Half Begins

**45'**| The home team starts the 2nd half! 

**49'**| üü®
Jorginho (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card 

**59'**|
Johnson wins a corner, and the tension builds as the referee pauses the set-piece delivery to have a chat with the scuffling Son and Trossard. However, all the tension dissipates when the short corner ends with the ball flying over every head in the box and eventually out for a throw-in.

**60'**| It has been 30 minutes since Arsenal last attempted a shot in this game.

##**64'**| ‚öΩ Goal! Tottenham Hotspur 0, Arsenal 1. Gabriel Magalh√£es (Arsenal). Assisted by Saka

- GOOOAAALLL!!! GABRIEL PUTS ARSENAL IN FRONT!!! This is a huge moment as Arsenal take the lead from a corner! Saka swings an excellent ball into the six-yard box, with Vicario blocked off from getting there. Gabriel is somehow in plenty of space in a crowded penalty area, and he makes no mistake with his close-range header, thundering the ball into the back of the net to spark wild celebrations in the away end! 1-0 to the Gunners!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fhdp4e/tottenham_hotspur_0_1_arsenal_gabriel_magalhaes_64/)

**68'**| üîÑ
Substitution, Tottenham Hotspur. Wilson Odobert replaces Brennan Johnson.

**68'**| üîÑ
Substitution, Tottenham Hotspur. Pape Sarr replaces Rodrigo Bentancur.

**78'**|
Spurs are dominating the possession and the territory as they press for an equaliser, but they're not really threatening Arsenal, who seem content to let their rivals have the ball. Tottenham need a spark.

Match thread created by /u/VivaLosHeavies","1183","VivaLosHeavies","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fhef13/post_match_thread_tottenham_01_arsenal_english/","Taking off Maddison for Werner was very funny. I don‚Äôt even understand why spurs even made that transfer lol Really don‚Äôt get what spurs were going for. With no Odegaard and Rice Arsenal were always going to try be more solid. Spurs solution was just to spam crosses in to Solanke? They just had no idea what to do to win that game.   Atmosphere was also shite for a derby. What does Brennan Johnson actually do for Spurs? Never seemed like spurs were coming back after the goal, not a great sign for what should be high tempo ange-ball. Son especially seemed like a ghost when spurs needed to crank into gear Brennan Johnson is one of the dumbest players I‚Äôve seen . His decision making is terrible I‚Äôll tell you what, seeing Nwaneri coming in and not Kiwior was not something I expected. Kudos to Mikel, only offensive minded subs today in an away game. Lining up with Werner, Johnson, Odobert and Maddison is like turning up to World War 1 with a foam bayonet and a water pistol is there a reason why spurs players don‚Äôt shoot? Dam Arsenal sure have an impressive defence More dreadful football from Ange and the boys Seeing Sterling race down the left then cut a few times and dribble into four defenders ü•≤ Was Ange the one who said he didn‚Äôt need a set piece coach last season? Or was that Poch and I‚Äôm blurring them together because they‚Äôre both spursy managers? Or was it both? Outside of the first 10 games last year, Ange Spurs have been very mid Arsenal officially have won more matches at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 5 years than Spurs have won at the Emirates in nearly 20. Why do Spurs play so slow in attack.  So many times they were in a good position but rather play sidewards and let Arsenal get players back Wasn't quite the shithouse terrorball victory we were praying for but a very solid defensive performance and managed to find the goal when it counted. Made Spurs look pretty toothless for most of the game. Gabi XL absolutely immense as usual.  Never thought we'd win three on the bounce in their gaff. I don't know what to say. 8 years we went without winning here. I've now seen us win here three times in a row, something we never did even with wenger. The latest win without our entire fucking starting midfield.  I am so so fucking grateful to mikel arteta, I cannot tell you. Spurs just didn‚Äôt seem to know what to do, crossing to no one over and over again. Soon as Arsenal got the players back it was impossible for Spurs to create seems like defenders have figured out that if they leave brennan johnson free, he'll clear the ball for them Perhaps next time Arsenal should rest Saka as well to give Spurs a better chance of winning at least a point  On a more serious note, Gabriel completely dominated the game, even if we disregard the goal I fucking love our centre backs so god damn much So many great performances but how the fuck was Timber a CB? He looks like he could play every position on the pitch! Doesn‚Äôt look hampered by the ACL at all i would let brennan johnson shoot all day if it kept son from having the ball Timber man , goodness me , he is him, I know now what we missed last season I like the game plan of avoiding Spurs press and just going long until Spurs eased off. Similar to what City did to Arsenal at the Etihad 2 years ago. Also, Spurs are super dangerous with their entry passes breaking the 2nd line, and Arsenal were smart to just concede possession and close down those lanes.  I think mature coaches know when they need to adapt to the opposition, and I like that Arteta came with a specific plan for this game. What;s amazing is Saliba was on a yellow from 15 mins and Timber from 35 mins. They played the whole match. Years ago I would of thought one of our defenders would be off. Every team with a decent defence is going to play Tottenham thinking they can come away with something, because they seem to have no idea what the plan is in the final third. Spurs played with good intensity in the midfield but their final third play was awful. Bad touches, bad passing, poor decision making too. Arsenal's defense is so damn solid it's impressive. A defense like that wins you games when the midfield/forwards aren't at it. They're weaker in the middle of the park without Rice and Ode and the defense stepped up to compensate. Raya was fantastic today too. He's really impressed this season so far. Professional true title contender win this by Arsenal in a big game especially considering if they dropped points City would be so hard to catch  A set piece goal, take the sting out of the game, compact let them have possession without a true threat Arteta seen prime pulisball in the barclays videos and decided to copy What a match! No starting midfield and Arsenal walks into Spurs stadium and digs out a win. Huge for the season. Everyone is complaining about Manchester City‚Äôs charges, but not ONE single complaint about Arsenal having two home stadiums. Arsenal with no √òdegaard and Rice. Spurs never stood a chance, did they? Someone needs to ask in the press conference,   ""Ange, have you heard of the phrase All Wank, No Cum?"" Big Gabi deserves a free meal from one of those Brazilian restaurants on Tottenham high road They really made this man London manager of the year after 4 months. Lol Spurs could‚Äôve played for 19 years straight and they wouldn‚Äôt have scored Even if Gabriel didn‚Äôt score that goal he still deserved MotM Spurs looked absolutely toothless against a team that fielded two of the slowest midfielders in the prem [deleted] Arsenal weren't good going forward but no one should think this was a robbery or an undeserved win. Tottenham were just as poor if not worse. Actually it is worse for them considering that's all they could muster at home in the derby. 3 Point Lane Saliba and Gabriel are a brick wall. Also Timber what a performance. I am buzzing Swapping Timo for Maddison when your entire strategy was cross into a compact defence is like going into a gun fight with a dildo carved out of American cheese. Timber was cooking today Gentlemen Jorginho and Partey double pivot, I‚Äôm still in shock we pulled this off. Ange on Fraud Watch. Funnily enough I think the injuries made the game easier for Arsenal. Mourinho ball against spurs who have 0 cutting edge worked wonders. Fully shit myself late on with that deflected shot in stoppage time We have been shockingly bad since that crazy game against Chelsea when we played that comical high line with only 9 players. Nearly a year has passed and we look shite. Ange will be gone by Xmas if something doesn‚Äôt change and change fast Timber is immense and is absolutely an upgrade to our already great defense I still think Spurs will stay up. Three straight wins for Arsenal away at Spurs At some point its all about club mentality..Clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United in their banter eras have actually won stuff which if it happened at Spurs would be considered a ""golden era"",Look at fucking Leicester they have been relegated and still given their fans more moments of joy in the last decade 3 years in a row with an away win at Spurs. We have now more wins at their new stadium that they have at the Emirates. What a record Three wins in a row at this stadium. Sorry but the stadium is ours now, that‚Äôs the rules Cagey NLD. Definitely some stuff to work on, but rolling out that midfield and winning at spurs. Top shelf work boys Fuck the PGMOL, but the voices were right: winning this on a depleted midfield does go down a treat Spurs fans, with a serious face, will keep trying to convince you that Romero is the best CB in the league. Is there anyone better at catching a football than David Raya!?   With him in goal, I almost never feel like we‚Äôre threatened when a cross comes in. So great to have that level of reassurance for a skill I had never considered being THIS important! Boring Boring Arsenal... I love you ""Are you watching Arsenal?"" Only caught the last 15 minutes or so, was expecting a big Spurs onslaught but it never came. Absolutely nothing going on in wide areas, crossing was awful. Didn't realise Son was playing until he tried to shoot from 40 yards. Angeball is like a butterfly trying to bite an Elephant‚Äôs arse. Depleted squad, away from home. This is a huge and necessary win if Arsenal are going to have any title aspirations On a serious note, questions need to be asked about how Ange saw the best defense in the league and thought ‚Äúyou know what we need to do? cross the ball 31 times to our lone CF‚Äù and then just run with it for 90 minutes. lmao how did we pull that off with our midfield Spurs could really do with someone like Conte or Mourinho to play with a bit more steel and pragmatism in these big games. Gabriel motm. Absolute rock, he loves the nld. They can demolish White Hart Lane but they can never demolish Three Point Lane Can we talk about the time wasting incident though?   I thought that by the letter of the law we‚Äôre supposed to see yellows. They cross it from the left. They cross it from the right.  Playing at home Spurs look so fucking shite. Has Ange gotten any sort of result against Arsenal since he took over? Seems like he can never get it done against Tottenham's biggest rival. Was spurs gameplan to just cross and hope for the best Might be the most ineffective I've seen Spurs' attack in a long time.   Solanke was invisible Wait, aren't Spurs fans supposed to be happy when their team concedes at home? I picked son solanke and maddison in my FPL draft league this year, so Arsenal fans you can thank me for this one 60m+ on Solanke is certainly a decision Arsenal midfield B > Spurs midfield A Best central duo in the world Spurs have lost 7 of their last 11 PL games but no one cares because Big Ange calls journalists 'mate' and played a high line when down to 9 men against Chelsea. What a player Timber is  Fuck me, mans running up, down, dribbling, passing, tackling and all to such a fucking high level  Wonderful I know Raya didn‚Äôt have too much to do today but he‚Äôs so good Spurs competing with Southampton for having most possesion and absolutely nothing Wait, why didn't Spurs fans do the Poznan today? Spurs reminded me so much of Arsenal under Emery.   Just can‚Äôt seem to attack properly if it isn‚Äôt a counter attack. Could see Arsenal being content to sit back for much of the game. Even with sitting back, Arsenal created much better chances than Tottenham.  Not sure what Ange Ball is, but if it is that, good luck getting even top 6  (I know it was against probably the best defense in the league but in a derby, 1-0 down, at home, and you play like that in the second half??) But I though Maddison was better than Odegaard Hey Spurs have you tried crossing the ball into the box from the right side of the field again? Surely it‚Äôll work the 15th time you do it.  My god the team plays so predictably. Got no bias towards either team but I was getting a bit frustrated watching Spurs play today.   Also Levy‚Ä¶ lower those ticket prices. Atmosphere was Shambolic for a NLD. ‚ÄúGive us something to cheer for‚Äù and all I know but when the team seemed to need a kick in the arse neither the players or crowd seemed up for it. ‚ÄúEnglish Yellow Wall‚Äù my ass. Half the fans were on their phones. Everywhere they goooo  Pretty mild for an NLD though Nwaneri looked good Imagine spurs fans saying their midfield was going to boss our midfield, I‚Äôm dead üíÄ couldn‚Äôt even outplay Havertz as a midfielder and Jorginho [deleted] I'll take that, especially with key players missing. Spurs are absolutely horrid thoughü§£ü§£ Maybe Spurs should get a set piece coach. Good win for Arsenal. Put some pressure on city to  get serious and finally play Rodri Werner blocking our own shot in the 90th minute whilst also being offside sums up that game   He can fuck off back to Germany Ange got schooled big time I honestly rate Ange and thought he was gonna be the one to turn spurs around (he still might) but can't help but feel he's digging his own grave. The stubborn refusal of a set piece coach looks worse and worse by the day, the comments about only small teams care about rivalries was moronic, and the players he's signed for his system look bang average. Today we were forced to play a second string geriatric midfield and he didn't give Sarr (who would've ran circles around us) any minutes at 8. It was such a promising start but he needs to get his shit together quick or it might be an early end Mate. Honestly Spurs are in trouble. Ange subs were genuinely brain dead and they showed 0 cutting edge against two geriatric men in midfield   I didn‚Äôt want to jinx this but what the fuck was Ange thinking bringing on Werner against a low block lmao There will still be some Tottenham fans claiming Romero is on the level of Saliba, let alone Gabriel. We saw his disaster week 1 at Leicester. Then he scores a couple goals and plays with intensity‚Ä¶  and some people forget that defending is an art that requires a brain and concentration. He made a shocking choice to stop tracking Gabriel and start ball watching. In American football terms, he‚Äôs a cornerback that makes flashy interceptions but regularly gets caught out because he lacks practical defensive awareness and focus.   Also Vicario is the shortest tall man in the world. Raya, a ‚Äúshort‚Äù GK, comes out and dominates the 6 yard box. That‚Äôs his best trait for all the talk of playing with his feet. Our number 6 is the king of Brazil How has ange let two uncles rock up to his home stadium and leave with 3 points. Dreadful approach from him Tottenham are such bottlers  Johnson and Solanke looks way below top 4 level. I think they will turn out to be poor signings. Awful game, awful ref but Arsenal just about edged it. I think Arteta realised Tottenham really struggle breaking down a low block so he set up the team as solid and compact as possible. Some really nice play faltering at the final pass. Tottenham had so much of the ball and did so little with it. They really need to invest in some good wingers, Solanke was feeding off scraps Vicario has a very clear weakness.    ""Best defender in the league, arguably in the world"" Romero was also weak as piss on the goal. Yeah he got nudged in the back but it wasn't enough to be a foul and he didn't even try to get back and contest against Gabriel. Solanke is a myth Expressions getting Porro and Van de Ven into a combined XI with Arsenal defenders is fucking hilarious now. Uncle Partey and Uncle Jorg stood on business today The quality of the chance conversion made the real difference today:   xG: Spurs 0.74 - Arsenal 0.73 xGOT : Spurs 0.33 - Arsenal 1.50   Spurs looked pretty toothless to the eye. Now can we be honest, did anyone in this sub ever think solanke would be worth anywhere near 60m? On less positive side, I do not remember last time I thought Martinelli had a good match Raya is a monster Ouch, 3 away losses at home in the derby in a row? That‚Äôs got to really sting. Particularly when this one came without Arsenals entire starting midfield. The chasm is massive.  Chin up spurs fans, maybe next season. Probably not though. Feels like Spurs have got their recruitent wrong recently. Don't rate Solanke, Werner or Johnson at this level of expectation. Angeball looks to be so bad..  Son, solanke, kulu, johnson and maddison seems to have the same role.. and none of those forwards got any clue where to be on the field Romero is the Argentinian Mustafi and no one can convince me otherwise. Shits the bed everytime. Fake hard man. Spurs with all the possession outside of the danger zone and hoofing balls into our box which we mopped up with ease = Spurs played really good No Rice‚Ä¶No Odegaard, no problem. 3 points in the bag. We move. Big Gabi. Put some respect on this man‚Äôs name. Romero ain‚Äôt nothing before this man. Confidence game. The next one we have to face without M√ò8 should be much less nervy. But it is clear to see how influential his partnership with Saka impacts the latter‚Äôs potency r/coys and chill Arsenal have more wins at the new spurs stadium than spurs have at the emirates Throwing romero up front doesn't seem very ""ange"". I never remember him throwing Carl Starfelt up top when celtic were losing to St Mirren. Spurs have a higher net spend than Chelsea since 'big ange' joined. They've now picked up just 44 of the last 96 points available.  At what point do his credentials start to come into question? Arsenal were a shadow of their full strength today and take all of the points in YOUR backyard. Spurs really need to book up their ideas before Ange needs to take a little walk down the road of the job centre. It‚Äôs ok though, because this loss doesn‚Äôt mean any more or less than any other loss. Gabriel and Saliba were immense today. Attackers must dread facing them. Andy Townsend is still moaning about the two hands on Romero, that the player himself didn‚Äôt protest about. Pretty comfortable victory for Arsenal all things considered pathetic performance from Spurs Worst Spurs performance against us in a long time. Man ode and rice gone is roooouuugh We basically played to bypass our own midfield, never seen us go long ball so much. Though with Spurs high line it's a valid tactic and we probably should have scored when Martinelli was through in the first half.   Can't fault the tactics given the depleted state of our midfield.¬†   Great result solanke and Johnson dint help them much I don‚Äôt want to be all depressing here but my girlfriend of 3 years just had a miscarriage yesterday, and it was devastating for both of us I‚Äôve been an emotional wreck but this win has brought some light back into my life and I can remember what it like to feel happy again so thank you Arsenal Spurs why would you do this.¬† What‚Äôs that stat? Arsenal have now won more matches at Spurs new stadium than spurs have at the emirates since it was built‚Ä¶in 2005.   Spursy Four four fakkinnnnn twoooo Ultimate ""Cry about that"" setup and execution by Arteta Why did Tottenham play like that? As listless a performance as you'll see anywhere. The pattern of play was the same: pass at a snails pace, get to the edge of the area, then check backwards and give it to a midfielder.  In other words, the problems are the exact same as they were last season - a lack of creativity in wide positions. And now exactly what everyone said would happen is already happening a few games in.  I don't know who needs to hear this, but if you just miss out on the CL and need to kick on, you can't have the majority of your signings be *teenagers*.   Whoever is in charge of transfers for Tottenham needs to answer some serious questions. Spurs could have played for 10 hours and they wouldn‚Äôt have scored I would be disappointed if I were a spurs fan tbh  They had all the advantages and it was their best opportunity to beat us while were lacking some key players, and they looked absolutely toothless.  20 passes ending in a cross to nobody ad infinitum. That's how you handle business when you're without important players. Thought we held up well defensively and showed why we're called the best defense in the league. I have been saying spurs spending 110m on solanke and Johnson is going to look stupid both of them are squad quality players for a top 4 team or midtable players Postecoglou? More like Ain‚Äôt Got A Fucking Clue I can‚Äôt stress this enough, but having more possession cause your opposition has a gameplan counting on you have more possession and then playing on the counter is really not something to be bragging about. To top that with having your gameplan relying so much on crosses against a team that sets up so well to deal with them is questionable at best from the coaching staff.  In short, if this is Spurs playing well may it long continue lmao Love to remember that Ange was the backup plan to Slot. Just nothing going under him right now, less than the sum of the parts. Lots of people clowning the defence but only .8 xg for arsenal is fine IMO. It's the incredibly poor chance generation going forward that is inexcusable¬† Fuck me Gabriel-Saliba is amazing duo Gabriel and Raya dragging the corpse of Jorginho and Partey away at Spurs.  YOU LOVE TO SEE IT 3 points, TYVM Arteta owns them Entire starting midfield out lmao Honestly a shit game from both team to watch for them neutrals  However, considering we were without Odegaard and Rice, it was a given  Spurs on the other hand never felt like they were gonna score at all  Total shutdown from our defense Massive 3 points. Was shitting bricks going into the NLD missing Rice and Odegaard, but we‚Äôre just so solid defensively.   3 away NLD wins in a row in damn impressive. [Mystic Meg Award winner right here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fatd1s/riccardo_calafiori_injury_vs_france/llx75xq/) Spurs had so many great positions in attack, especially in the first half, that could have led to tens of clear chances, but their final pass and end product was basically non-existent. So disappointing from them because the 3 points were there to be taken and they still managed to lose.   My. I'm c Tottenham should be absolutely rinsed for this performance. Like God damn. Why have they been so poor? They have quality players Spurs do be Spursy. Surely Brennan Johnson has to be the worst winger who starts week in week out in the PL? He's  an absolutely diabolical  player. he's up there with the likes of Mudryk and Anthony... At some point teams are gonna realize when zinchenkos isn‚Äôt our starting at LB, that left side is not our weak point. Fuck around with timber if you want, no soup for you lol Not a great game from Arsenal but 3 points are 3 points. Missing midfield was so evident but luckily the massive defence and a great set play by Saka got it where we need to be.  Spurs keep playing around possession but their finishing was shocking today but they struggled to make any meaningful chances outside of the first 20 or so mins. I don't know what Postecoglou is planning, but you can't be happy as a Spurs fan to have 4 points in 4 games. Romero is my favourite Spurs players, absolutely awful hahaha Their stadium starting to feel like a true home, wouldn't mind playing a few games there instead of the Emirates every season I'm not one of those Spurs fans who expected a win today, but I hoped we'd eke out a draw. Arsenal are the better team right now, but the bigger problem is how Angeball is being exposed. He only has one way of playing and when it isn't working, Spurs have no plan B. The worst start in 9 years is a huge worry. That's the best back 4 in the world right? Saliba and Gabriel are leagues above Romero and VDV. Really showed today Best back 4 in world football. Insane. Our players are shit, Ange's tactics are shit, we're just shit. I don't even care when we lose anymore, I just expect it. This team is slowly making me hate football Spurs plan for the final half hour was just chucking aimless balls into the box from the right wing. Never looked threatening whatsoever. It's da history of da Tottenham Tottenham really should've looked better against an Arsenal team missing 7 senior squad players Mate set pieces aren‚Äôt even real. the difference in levels between these teams wauwie wauwie, encroyable, Lmaoooo get innnnnnn !flair :Arsenal: Spurs one of the least threatening teams I‚Äôve ever seen. ¬£50m on a roadrunner out wide, crazy stuff. All you‚Äôve got to do is sit off Spurs, force them wide, crowd the centre, let them run out of ideas, then hit the high line on the break.   If that fails, they‚Äôre weak as piss on set pieces. Thank googness that fixutre is done with for another season. 3 points, now next an easy one. Man City..gulp! Spurs might be the least threatening team with the ball in the league. All out attack for 90 minutes makes no sense if the other team knows it's coming and can prepare for the same variations of play a week in advance. Arteta knew they'll have their chances and finish them when needed. Then they can retreat and wait for Spurs to undo themselves. Who need midfield & forward when you have DEFENDER Gabriel man of the match Neither team played great but I‚Äôll take the win!! Was hoping for a nil nil all things considered How can a team be this much of a pushover in set pieces for this long? I think I‚Äôve seen Spurs concede from set pieces all year long. Also I thought Ange was playing beautiful, attacking football again. That attack looked toothless, lots of people running around doing fuck all, like I pretend to be busy at work the first week of the month. i have a question. what is ange ball? Some of the Spurs players are too selfish and would rather attempt poor shots at the goal than to pass it to someone else at a better position. Son wasn't playing so hot today, either. Just what kind of strategy or tactics were they discussing? What a wonderful football team Arsenal are. Backs against the wall today, made Spurs look like schoolboys in attack. This is even more enjoyable than the last two, I think Spurs are 100% getting dumped out of the Europa League if they can't handle a team that plays more defensively Lol ange is not going to last this season Rolling up without our entire midfield and winning still. LMAO sp*rs. Ange Postecoglou's committment to not working on set piece defending pays off once again for Spu...oh wait.  Vicario is a complete liabilty, you cannot watch replays of the Arsenal goal and tell me he's a quality goalkeeper, he's not even being pressured yet he somehow ends up in a crowd of players with no idea where the ball is.   Arsenal weren't brilliant, but even at this stage of the season this is a massive win. Spurs are awful what a shit match from them, don‚Äôt see what spurs supporters see in their manager at all. Attacking football without goals means fuck all I was never worried about anything they threw at us. This defense man... They're so fucking good, I'm a very stressful person and still they've managed to teach me to have big big confidence in them.   Love them, now Timber included. Knew he had the flair, but today I realized he's got the edge, the dirty and the dog too. Romero is fucking overrated, same with Maddison and Vicario The Arsenal midfield was so lightweight and pathetic today, hope to never see them 3 together again DEFENSIVE FUCKING MASTERCLASS.   That second half was a breeze for us.   NORTH LONDON IS RED. LIKE ALWAYS. How do you get done in midfield by two uncles and a striker? Odobert seems class [deleted] Lmao let‚Äôs all laugh at spurs Timber and big gabi dragged their huge balls all over spurs today I geniuenly think Arsenal have the best defense in the world at the moment. 4 points after 4 games with almost ‚Ç¨400m spent in 2 seasons. Time for the sack mate? I can‚Äôt believe Solanke didn‚Äôt score from the chance he had in the first half. 100% sure that Kane would have buried that.  Not complaining though. I wasn‚Äôt too nervous today, despite it being NLD. Spurs didn‚Äôt create anything of note in the second half. Spurs were spectacularly boring timid and uncreative.  You cannot beat a team as disciplined as arsenal without being brave with the ball, especially when VdV  can recover transitions. The league needs to get back to running with the ball. You can‚Äôt pass your way through man to man defence structures without having some of the best midfielders in world football and we can‚Äôt all have a KDB, so take a man on and stretch the field. All spurs needed to do was be more direct but you can tell in the way they played, they‚Äôre afraid. Conte was right This was really Spurs best chance to get a result against us and that's what you put forth? Brennan Johnson has deactivated his social media after taking even more pelters from Spurs fans. Funniest part is every single spuds fan will still pick Romero over Gabriel in the Combined 11 or even ‚ÄòPL best defenders‚Äô for that matter Is vdv the first defender who‚Äôs a pace merchant? It‚Äôs the history of the Tottenham u/tottenhamnole or that other Spurs/Seminoles guy that pretends to not be tottenhamnole is probably not having a great time. FSU have lost their first 3 games and Spurs have won 1 of their first 4 games Anges team should have wanted to beat a rival team more. Small club mentality Someone explain Angeball to me like I'm 5 Oh Ange. You would've been legendary mate. What could've been. Fucking Tottenham of all teams. Postecoglu won‚Äôt change his ways. It‚Äôs just who he is mate. You need to watch his celtic days‚Ä¶.    4 games played, 4 points. What more can you ask? Those Arsenal substitutions were ballsy to say the least.. 1 nil to the Arsenal! HOORAY Ange reminds me of myself when i started playing FM. No gameplan just cross it to the big lad up top 20 times per game* This is football 'eritage. How embarrassing for Tottenham. This was Arsenal at their worst. They were pretty shit but somehow Tottenham manages to be even worse Well done to Nwaneri today, he did a great job off the bench Riddled with injuries and I went into this hoping we could get a draw, I need to have more faith lmaoo Damn that was pathetic from Spurs even early in the game spurs players were taking way too long with the ball, almost never playing it first time. Too many times I saw them slow dribble for way to long just to put in an arm's length pass they could've made with their first touch instead. More wins at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in three years than they‚Äôve managed in nearly 18 years at the Emirates. Nice. Against such an unathletic midfield with Partey and Jorginho you'd think Spurs would have dominated the midfield but it was very uninspiring from them, only Kulusevski¬† impressed me from their side today.  As for our performance, not the best but expected worse, Saliba and Gabriel were immense and second half barely felt threatening. Havertz also did well with the little service he got and Raya very good at claiming crosses as usual. I‚Äôve seen sharper spoons than Tottenhams front line. As a Liverpool fan I don‚Äôt see any progress under Ange‚Äôs Tottenham. He‚Äôs surely gotta be under pressure, especially after this result. The team is just so mid It‚Äôs amazing how good we are away from home now ONE NIL TO THE ARSENAL What foul are they talking about??? 3-4 more games and the Australian Sam Allardyce will be sacked. Then Tottenham will apoint another shit manager who will be sacked after 1.5 seasons while sitting 8th-9th on the table.Rinse and repeat.They had the chance to cement themself as a top 4 team but the managment of team as a whole is just shit.They will never be a big team with levy. What do football scouts do? ¬£110m for Johnson and Solanke is bizarre. Give me a week and I‚Äôd get a list of 10 players in Europe who are better and cheaper. Why do so many clubs overpay for mediocre English players? I don't think I understand Angeball. Stagnant attacking and terrible defending. How's not training set pieces going for you Ange mate? Lmao don‚Äôt even need Odegaard and Rice to beat those muppets. And they may find ways to suck themselves off  But Gabriel moves with a purpose   15 PL goals, the dirtywork defender of this backline and a 4 year stalwart through a constantly evolving Arteta squad. Always shows up. Always makes a difference. Fuck your differing opinion because stats don't lie, performances don't lie.  This dude is the best defender in this league. And his hype man isn't too shabby either If I were a spurs fan I‚Äôd be pissed you guys couldn‚Äôt beat arsenal without their two best midfielders Damn Arsenal are really back to owning them. It‚Äôs not even a rivalry no more. Can‚Äôt beat us at our lowest with so many injuries. NLD starting to become not important How tf is Spurs midfield so bad? We were missing Rice and Ode yet they couldn‚Äôt even control the midfield üíÄüíÄ Love that Spuds are dooming their team into a mediocre season again with just 4 matches played. We really killed their dreams today. I love it. At this point last season, they were talking title contention. How the turntables... 9 PL wins and negative goal difference in 22 games this calendar year. The football is completely ineffective outside of battering a relegation team every couple of months and he's far too stubborn to change anything.   Bye Ange, mate. Tbh , thats the worst NLD i remember , nothing happened in this game.   2 interesting things , spurs trying to act tough over timber , and the goal. other than that nothing happened.  playing solanke after kane for years is fucking great  . what was spurs gameplan? trying timber over and over and flying balls at the box with 2 of the best cb's in the leauge. Ange 2nd season hype üò≠üò≠ Partey was trying to full on sabotage us lmao hahahahahahahahahahahah spurs Can any Celtic fans weigh in on whether you were terrible at defending set pieces too or is this just a Tottenham issue? If only Ange had more fire going into this as a big fixture for the fans Lots of people deleting a lot of tweets. A win is a win. 3 wins in a row at this shit stadium - same as spurs‚Ä¶this is our home now boys Away win with some key absences.  Good day we move Turns out pissing about on the outside of Arsenal's box and backwards passing at every attacking opportunity limits your ability to score... Who knew? 0 composure from Spuds man, so bad. Embarrassing from Spurs, 3 wins in a row at their place. Forever our lil bros For a combined ¬£110 million, Solanke and Johnson really needed to contribute more and need to become much more rounded. Feel that surely for 2/3 of the price they could have got more game-changing forwards Spurs attack was stinking it up Partey and Jorginho midfield and they still didn't create anything. love to see a midfield without rice and odegaard getting it done Teta owns nandos fc Feel like they should‚Äôve gone for Gyokeres instead of Solanke Lads‚Ä¶ Last 30 minutes was watching a team desperately trying to pass the ball into the goal. People who love to shit on Big Gabi, there you go. He always comes in with the clutch moments when it matters.  I will hear no slander against him Ange mate, that‚Äôs an embarrassment. What's up with Tottenham under Ange?   I mean the question honestly, I don't watch them outside of the NLD so maybe today was a one off, but the last few seasons they've always been able to raise the tempo and make it nervy even in the NLD games that they ultimately lost. Today was different, they were more dangerous at 0-0 - soon as that goal went in it was as though the game was over. I don't think Arsenal were truly troubled in the last 20 minutes. 60 mil for a shite striker  Drawing against a promoted team  Losing against the orcs  Losing to their rivals at home with Arsenal missing their midfield   Fucking lmao That was an excellent defensive performance by Arsenal. gimme those spurs excuses and tears with the bottle of red I‚Äôm about to open No rice no odegaard no problem :) 3 points at the toilet bowl! Now I have to go take a tottenham :) 11 points in FPL. Saka + Saliba. Good day Lmaoo they couldn‚Äôt beat us without Rice and Odegaard In a time of uncertainty and without their leader, Arsenal went to a place of comfort...~~white hart.~~...Tottenham Hotspur Stadium! Running away from the toilet with another 3 points Spurs players did do a good job of acting hard, I‚Äôll give them that People don't talk enough about how Spurs haven't even won a league cup after spending more than majority of the clubs in the English football pyramid No Rice. No Merino. No √òdegaard. NO PROBLEM. [deleted] A good game Tottenham attack is so toothless. Arsenal was dire as well, but they took their chance. Winning when you're not playing well is a sign that you have the grit to compete. Thanks for the win Romero. Best CB in the league I was told I guess this is what they mean when they say attack wins games, but defence wins championships. Barring the first 20 mins, I was never really worried about Spurs scoring; crossing to Solanke and praying doesn't work when we have Saliba at hand. Just wondered whether we had enough up top to nick one, and luckily we did!  Now if either Saliba or Gabriel get injured, then we have a real problem... Mourinho and Conte were right. Tinpot club I‚Äôll never understand why spurs dropped the amount of money they did on Solanke. Yes it‚Äôs early but he is not worth that amount if you are trying to be a top team. He is a solid mid table player, but it is spurs we are talking about so it makes sense It's actually embarrassing for Spurs. We were running retirement home in the midfield for the most of the game. with rice and √∏degaard missing too üíÄ tottenham is tottenham LADS Arsenal wore black to Tottenham‚Äôs funeralüíÄ Spurs will cope with this L by giving their fans free diddy tickets or something Once again the team that doesn‚Äôt have a set piece coach concedes from a set piece.  He really generous of Ange to tell his team to play like shit against us as well, why would you have any extra motivation against a rival lmao Wins at villa and spurs already is quite impressive ngl Spurs are so shit 3 Ws in 3 away games against Spurs. You love to see it No Rice, no √òdegaard, no Merino, and we still beat these jokers. Really not even mad, just incredibly disappointed.  We‚Äôre really facing the prospects having 1 from 6 given the form Brentford are in & United while shit are going to be able to beat us.  Don‚Äôt even necessarily think it‚Äôs primarily an Ange issue but a players, Ange, Levy & Co.  I‚Äôd give anything to be playing the footy we played under Conte when he had just signed on to Spurs. How can you expect spurs to win in a stadium built for the NFL. Ange cant cope with all them stoppages. Lost to an arsenal with zero first choice midfield playersüò≠üò≠üíÄ [deleted] Ange on massive fraud watch Imagine getting pumped by your biggest rival at home, against a weakened side   Ruined their whole week I reckon ü§∞üèº They are going to make a remake of Blood Diamond based on this game.   Ange Postecoglu will play Solomon Vandy and the film will just be 97 minutes of him shouting ‚ÄúWhere is my Son?‚Äù I can‚Äôt with the crosses anymore Lovely kick about with the boys Surely this was the easiest game for Arsenal this season, no? Spurs just look toothless. Is there a single spurs player besides Madison who can cross a ball? One of the most satisfying wins of the Arteta era Let's go. Who needs midfield when you have defense Spurs looked fucking toothless Thought I was watching our game against Tottenham at some points. Possession is pointless if you do nothing with it. Shithousing masterclass. Moyes Sensei must be looking down from the sky, smiling today that was a game alright Hehehe siuu Whenever Tottenham see Gabriel on the corner, they know they going to lose Good teams find ways to win in difficult situations.  Spurs were terrible at creating chances. Solanke looked sluggish on his one chance to pivot and shoot This is embarrasing loss for Spurs. Not even one proper shot on target against very poor Arsenal team. Worrying Spurs still lack proper structure to their attack and todays game reminded prime United just cross blindly into the box. ugly win but a win nonetheless, and another clean sheet, can't complain No odegaard or rice‚Ä¶ What an incredible set of defenders Mikel has assembled. Immense defensive performance. Didn‚Äôt feel like spurs had any belief after they went behind that they‚Äôd come back. Sure you can struggle to create quality against a team like arsenal but there wasn‚Äôt even an urgency from Spurs. How shit is Romero btw, Gabriel and Saliba showing him levels once again Tottenham fans just go watch another sport for the sake of your mental health, football is not for you. Delete the club and turn the stadium into a neutral concert arena. Raya giving Alisson stiff competition for best keeper in the league.   Vicario is just as good a shot stopper or maybe even better but Raya just has so much more presence in the box in claiming crosses and some of his distribution was just pinpoint onto a player's head Saliba is top 3 CB in the world [deleted] Dont worry spurs fans, your gaffer will just say mate three times and everyone will laugh and forget how piss poor you are That ref was horny for yellows Big gabi raya and saliba take a fucking bow, but especially Gabriel. Clean sheet and 3points without rice and martin away playing spurs, god there‚Äôs no better feeling for the rest of the week. This is the sort of performance that inspires absolutely zero hope. No positives to come away with here. So unorganized in both defense and attack. We haven‚Äôt got any attacking ideas and remain incredibly soft at the back at least twice a match. LADS‚Ä¶ Without Odegaard, Rice, and Merino in midfield and with a literal daycare on our bench. Ange is just out of his depth in this league. Arsenal weren't very good and they still didn't really struggle.¬† Lost Rice, Merino, √òdegaard, and Calafiori and still managed to snatch a win.  Peak Spurs. Come on Levy, give the fans free Beyonc√© tickets. We deserve at least that much ange got some worrying stuff in him Officiating needs to be looked at (ik people say this every game). Aside from that impressed with Kai, Timber and big Gabi today Couldn't beat us with our entire midfield out, forever our lil bros Toilet got flushed.ü§© Spurs have to be one of the most pathetic teams for derbies. Don't remember them ever doing well when they need to Reminder Arsenal were missing their ENTIRE starting midfield vs Spurs. Odegaard, Rice, and yes, Merino is a starter. Arteta doesn‚Äôt sanction a 30m pound signing for a 28 year old with 1 year left on his deal unless he ABSOLUTELY wants him. While Spurs had a pretty much healthy XI - and you can tell how shitty Partey was today, he should nowhere be near the XI   Joke all you want, Arteta coached a defensive masterclass today. Tomiyasu, Zinchenko also missing. Their bench had 3 players I had never heard before in my entire life. Excellent win for Arsenal imagine having to watch spurs every week üíÄ  ange wyd mate Send Archie back you fucks, ruining his development. WHAT DO WE THINK OF TOTTENHAM Lads it‚Äôs Tottenham Honestly without Kane, Spurs have nothing for Arsenal Poverty football lmao [deleted] We do a little bit of robbery. First half was all Spurs, we were largely limited to set pieces. Second half they got tired and we made one of our corners count.  Ref was shit all round, too many soft yellows and just let too many stoppages kill the game a bit.  Think we're in trouble against City if we repeat that first half as they'll be more punishing than Spurs. Still no timescale on Odegaard, Martinelli still has the yips, both DMs are bombscares against pacy teams although at least we'll have Rice back to take one of those two out. Another easy W at Three Point Lane I‚Äôve lost faith in the manager, I don‚Äôt want him out as there‚Äôs no replacement, but I just don‚Äôt care anymore, I‚Äôm apathetic.  Let‚Äôs see how the rest of the season pans out. Lads, it‚Äôs Tottenham Missing Person!   East Asian appearance.   Short, black hair.  Answers to the name of Heung Min Son.   No reward. Thrilled with the result. Beating Spurs away with our entire starting midfield out (and not getting over run) is a great reault  Our defence is rock solid. Spurs could have had 9 hours and they probably wouldnt have done shit Cross and inshallah. Beat them without our most crucial player and our 100m midfielder [deleted] Ange is shit Postecoglou won't last the season. Ange has been discovered. Had a good start to his spurs tenure but after that, nothing. Imagine not being able to even force a draw at your own gaff with us missing a midfield, ahahahahahahah What a clutch win for us, beat Spurs away with our B midfield. No Odegaard, no Rice, no problem I love large Ange and I appreciate what he‚Äôs trying to do but I think the system might need tweaking   Also solanke is awful Can someone who is neutral tell me how the officiating was? I didn't watch the match but I heard some people complaining. Played better than us and still lost, damn such an easy boring win #We hate you Tottenham we do  #WE HATE YOU TOTTENHAM WE DO üíÄ Is Ange just Australian Brendan Rodgers? London is red. Aint a derby üòÇ so easy, 3 in a row away hahaha Spurs attacking options are so mid, but Arsenal‚Äôs defending (as a team + individually) is ELITE 4 games in, the outstanding players from us are the back line, Havertz and Trossard. Spurs looks good from time to time, but they still have some glaring holes and lack plan B. What do we think of Tottenham After watching that shithouse defensive masterclass from Arsenal, I‚Äôm gagging for next week when the new Fifa comes out because I‚Äôm going to try & replicate that tactic on FUT and stink people out.   Watching that performance really got my juices flowing, I feel full of vigour watching that, stink Spurs out all game and then go up the other end and score from a set piece, football heaven. Tee hee Tottenham concede off of a corner, shocker. Gabriel was fucking immense today. He and saliba both. HOLY SHIT THE LAST MINUTE Amazing win with the amount of players we had out. Good to know Spurs can‚Äôt be Arsenal at home even with a makeshift midfield Spurs look so toothless this season. 100 crosses, but how many of them were good enough? What the fuck was with our passing today Even Allah can't help you with crosses that shit. 3 points' 3 points Mate I have been on the Ange train since day 0 but his team's inability to defend set pieces is making me question if I rated him too highly. COYG!!! Ange ball üî•üî•üî•üëÄüëÄüëÄ The Ange apologists in r/coys really need to take a step back and acknowledge how poor they've been under him for close to a year now. In the last 12 months their form puts them 11th and are showing absolutely no signs of improving and if it carries on like this - they'll be fighting for top half of the table, not the top 4.    He has got no plan B - it's just a suicidal high line and hope for an opposition mistake or a moment of brilliance from the attackers. It works in second rate leagues with opposition quality that isn't to the standards of the premier league - but against capable teams you get punished.    There just doesnt seem to be any acknowledgement for how dreadful they've been for so long - everyone here seems blind to it because Ange says funny things in press conferences sometimes. IMO Ange ball might actually be fine, good even, but Ange the talent evaluator (plus rest of the staff) has been so bad it doesn't matter. None of our attackers would start for any other big team. I love Son, but it isn't 2022 anymore, and everyone else isn't even close.   Brennan Johnson wouldn‚Äôt even be on any other big team's squad and he‚Äôs a locked-on starter for us for some reason. Trying to stay optimistic but looks like another season down the drain.... We were lucky to get spurs after our entire midfield became unavailable. Any other team would have put up a fight. Couldn't even beat our weak team üíÄ Do people still actually rate Ange? I'm thrilled for the 3 points, but besides that set piece, we were actually poor...  Raya should've been MotM. This is what we are here for! Fuck spurs, fuck ange, fuck Romero and fuck Vicario. Timber saliva and Gabriel‚Äôs are my heroes, g+s is the best cb pairing ever, Nwaneri is the next Messi, we own the scum again arteta knows exactly what we need lfg contract fully deserved Will Spurs get relegated??? What a shite match Lads hat trick of humblings Easy like Sunday morning Made great money on this result. Couldn't believe how good the odds were for Arsenal before the game. Arsenal are simply a far far better team than Spurs at the moment I don't like Tottenham. Spurs lmfao Man the Spurs job must be the cushiest right now. How is there not more pressure on Ange, that was turgid. Arsenal is a hard game yes, but no Rice, No Odegard and others missing they barely laid a glove on Arsenal and I‚Äôd back the Sunday league team I play with to score from a corner against them! You guys just came up against the best defense in the league, don‚Äôt feel too bad!  As a tip, Romero needs to bulk up a little bit Our B team > perennial losers A team  But in all seriousness, I really thought Solanke would be so good for spuds this season and he‚Äôs been awful every game so far I love Arteta but his refusal to sub people early is infuriating. Jesus and Sterling should have come on wayyy earlier especially with most of their players on a yellow and tired. Trossard and Martinelli were knackered. With that being said the fact that he's gone to Tottenham and won with a midfield of Jorg, Tross and a washed up Partey is amazing. That commentator was soooo upset that Gabriel goal stood and that it wasn't given a foul lmaoooo. Timber MOTM for me. Postenoclu living up to his name We were shit and idk how we won that but I‚Äôll absolutely take it fucking hell Does Arteta have a license to drive big vehicles? Cause he is very good at parking the bus. edit: I mean this as a compliment Nwaneri was nervous forsure once he got in which is fair, but still excited for him in the future.  Oh and get fucked s**** That was kind of easy mode at least they played a high lineüòÇüòÇüòÇ Spurs team is just lacking talent. Levi has made little investments into it. It doesn't even look like the board care for top 4. I wouldn‚Äôt leave my house for a month in shame if I lost to this Arsenal midfield interesting, i really expected spurs to win 4-0 because of how many arsenal fans were saying they had absolutely no chance with their best midfielders out   i really shouldn‚Äôt have emptied my 401k betting on it. arsenal truly have prevailed against all odds wow incredible Sterling still has a negative football IQ I will win a trophy myself for this club. Until then, we are in a time of darkness LOLLLLLLL Well that was an awful game of football. It's still not mathematically impossible for Spurs to win the league lol. maybe if Arsenal has 14 players injured/out instead of 7 next time Spurs will have a shot! One team is just better Can't believe we've won with two hospital patients in midfield lol, lmao even The Son-Solanke partnership does not work. Solanke with a LW who is not a LW is not complimentary to look at. Either Son or Solanke gotta start at the 9 with an actual LW on the wing.   This game also continues the biggest Ange problem for me since his arrival. He has no Plan B. He is not able to adapt the game well and if Plan A does not work, then Spurs do not win.   Spurs tried the same attack down the wings with a hard and flat ball into the box from start to finish and not once did it work, not even closely. MIND THE GAP!! Same old sterling Spurs really are a cross and hope team aren't they Australian fraud Damn what a hard fought win. Set piece FC does it again. Sterling doing the classic Sterling move already. Gonna be a long season with him... Proud of the boys!¬† [deleted] [deleted] Big Gabby leading the charge! Spurs are so shit at crossing amongst other things Get fkd Fuck yeah ! Lol Spurs absolutely lethargic I‚Äôve always thought of Tottenham sort of like vanilla ice cream - soft, bland, and uninspiring. Jorginho and Partey doesn‚Äôt exist in this game. Gunners go home.   Take yer horn with you Gabriel. [deleted] That game was certainly something Postecoglu isn‚Äôt gonna survive 2024. We were a Romero flop away from being on the more convincing side of a draw, I think it was an okay performance¬†   Solanke looked good if a little hesitant [deleted] So i guess Ange will leave this season. Who's next? Spurs are like us these days in so far as no manager lasting. Shout out to vicario for trying to make it a derby, not even that happy because the refs are so bad. Tottenham look like they‚Äôre getting worse, and part of it looks like players, part of it looks like the coach. Tottenham looked good and Arsenal won, NLD completed.  EDIT:  *****SORRY, LOOKED BETTER THEN ARSENAL***** The logical part of my brain says we‚Äôre more likely to be competing with spurs than Arsenal so this is a good result, but the emotional part of my brain says that the team with a rapist in the starting lineup doesn‚Äôt deserve to be happy. Obvious takes Matchday 4 NLD¬†  * final third possession. not scoring goals. it's a theme  * The ref was big dickin all through the first half and then completely changed his tune, i.e. the shove on Romero for the goal was not even looked at¬† * Irregardless of Romero‚Äôs play tonight, VDV has consistently shown that he is our most valuable defender * Son was off it, again. Despite his undeniable ability the system does not cater to his strengths at all and what the fuck, does Ange just want rid of him but there‚Äôs no easy way to do that to a Spurs legend?¬† Sean Dyche's wettest dream is watching this Arsenal team today. Surprised they managed to clinch it given that Sterling kept trying to dribble past 2-3 guys at or near overtime, losing possession and giving Spurs counters. If spurs could cross they'd be the best team in the league Terrorball ftw. That was a dull ass game. Both teams shit, 0-0 should've been the score. Game could have gone either way to be honest. Yes Arsenal were great but the amount of balls Spurs were getting into the box is very telling that it was a closer game than this comment section makes it seem. [deleted] Arsenal play like the England national team in big games, effective but dreadful to watch Arteta seems to get away with being way out of his touchline alot Solid tactical plan from Arteta. Go to a massive club away from home, play for the draw, and hope to nick the win on a set piece. Pretty funny to see arsenal fans using the 'possession doesn't make you a better team' line like they've not been saying the opposite when they've 'dominated' but lost. City is going to run circles around this Arsenal team Curious how Arsenal fans will defend Gabriel‚Äôs push off on Romero after crying about Joelinton doing the same thing to them last season for an entire year Arsenal are effective but so boring to watch Cunts Massive push on goal, would be 4 posts on the front page if that was Spurs goal on Arsenal [deleted] Awful game.   Arsenal are definitely not going to win the league and Tottenham are just shite.   An Australian as a Manager, what can an Australian know about football? lmao Terrorism won. That amount of energy, heart and pace Tottenham plays with over 90 mins is amazing but without brain cells if they had just little amount of brain cells they would have been one of the best teams in the world. Atalanta will show you how to beat Arsenal it only takes brain cells and make every attack dangerous What a waste of time. Absolute bore as it usually is when Arsenal are playing a non relegation team Absolutely did not deserve to win Alan shearer saying arsenal have the best back 4 is criminal lmao Dumbass Arsenal fans acting like they won fairly. Foul on the corner and got away with so much. Scumbag fanbase and scumbag club. A truly gritty performance from Arsenal today. Problem is, they‚Äôve always capable of a performance like the one against Brighton‚Ä¶ They got like 80 Million for Kane and Spent 70 on fucking Solanke and the rest on the Timo Werner loan.   Honestly should have just bought 80 million bags of Haribo. I was happy to see that change That was strange. Maddison is one of the only creative players they have. Said to my brother I can actually relax more now they've taken off some of their best threatening player. Always rate Maddison and Son the latter needing his confidence back Werner was very good for us last season. Atmosphere was awful, after all that chatter from the supporters group asking Spurs to let them build a natural ambiance. Embarrassing playing johnson instead of odobert or deki on the right was the wrong move. no space behind and brennan‚Äôs got the worst decision making and composure on our team Ange‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt really work against low blocks Spamming crosses against perhaps the best team in the world at clearing away crosses sure was a decision It was great first 10 but then it really fizzled out. I thought Arsenal did a great job of slowing the game down first 10. yeah lets spam crosses in towards arguably the best cross-stopping keeper in the league for 2 years running Was it shit in the ground? The mics were weird on the broadcast I didn't like it. All good teams cross, you have a Liverpool flair lmao you have been leading the league in crosses with City for like years, Arsenal cross a lot too  Crossing is fine, why do people have so much issue with it   ESPECIALLY since the tricky intricate play was not working, Arsenal are great defensively He cost 50 million ! Youth-like appearance Welsh Antony Boost the home grown intake for Spurs. Vibe merchant They saw him run down the wing once and thought ""yeah, that should do it"" lmao Run forest He's actually solid... as a sub. He should never ever start Spurs are just incredibly predictable. They'll play a high offensive line, commit their fullbacks into attack and you'll get space to play in behind. Throw in their weaknesses for set pieces and it is very easy to concoct a game plan against them. They start very strong but feels like they drop off a lot after the first 15 minutes They didn't really have a clear cut attempt the entire game. As soon as a defence sits deep they‚Äôve no clue how to break it down Son has been a bit of an enigma for a while now Son was the invisible man. Very disappointing There‚Äôs 0 conviction in anything he does, cutting inside or trying to go outside, it‚Äôs as if he knows it‚Äôs not going to work before he does it That dude is dog ass   Guy has the decision making of a toddler reminds me of sterling toward the end of his city career. pace to get himself into positions and just goes braindead once he has to play a ball or shoot He looked good on the ball too, good pass to setup martinelli who was slightly offside I hope he gets more opportunities soon, he‚Äôs going to be a hell of a player That had more to do with taking Saka off rather than steeling up the defense, no? Would prefer Nwaneri there for someone who would need to be able to carry the ball Yeah not taking Jorgi off for Kiwior was a surprise Was kiwior on the bench? I thought he was suspended internally because he wouldn't accept a tranfer offer this summer. We were incredibly solid at the back.  We need fresh attackers to help press and keep their defenders honest with the threat of our counter.   If we had just 11 defenders, Spurs would create chances just by having more numbers. Werner made the team worse lol Maddison had a good start to last season, said he was the main man of Sunday dinners for some reason and just dropped stinkers thereafter Im watching from an arsenal bar in vienna and the austrian guy behind me said ‚Äúwerner? Schiesse‚Äù in the most sarcastic voice and the entire bar burst out laughing A foam bayonet üò≠ I don't watch many Spurs games, but has Maddison justified his transfer fee? From the few games that I have watched him, he's been a very mid version of the player that he was in Leicester City.   With Partey and Jorginho today having an average performance (Partey infuriated me at times when he kept giving the ball away and was slow to track back at times. Jorginho was okay at best), he really should have done better. And the water pistols broken. against our defence too lol Was like bringing on the wish.com avengers Maddisson isn't in that category. Odobert seems harsh but the other two are genuinely useless I mean if you shoot, it might be a goal. But if you pass, it could be anything! Maybe even a goal. I wish I knew And it‚Äôs not even full strength if you consider the depth which was not there today - plus Rice It kinda stings now seeing Timber being such a beast cuz things might've been different if we had him healthy last season ü•≤ It's not even full strength. Rice Merino Calafiori Odegaard and Tomiyasu were all missing They do, but Spurs are also terrible at breaking down defences. Saliba and Gabriel going on 3 years as a partnership helps. They‚Äôre both individually very good but they play very well together Best defence in the world by a mile Get used to it. _Vietnam flashbacks_ Truly playing the Reiss Nelson role i think he knew he was offside, just wasting more time It's going to take a minute for Arteta to untrain all those bad Chelsea habits. Havertz wasn't great at the beginning of last season either It was Ange. Both of them said that. Chelsea ignored that and got the Brentford set peice coach, Spurs didnt get anyone as far as I know That was indeed Ange. They can‚Äôt defend a set piece to save their lives.  Were Celtic bad at defending set pieces or is it just a problem he‚Äôs inherited? Absolutely no clue how to break down a deep block. Just whipped in crosses and shot from distance. Blunt. They seem so toothless in attack. Today especially. Tried about 300 crosses and every single one was awful sign mid table dross and you will play like a mid table team Chasing a goal and bringing on Werner and Odebert is grim + Ange tactics have been more than found out and he refuses to adapt Worse than mid, near relegation form since May But don't you dare question Ange as he says mate and cracks the occasional half-witty remark I'd be surprised if he lasts the whole season at this point No one cares cuz he‚Äôs funny and says mate  /s Once arsenal went ahead and sat back, Spurs couldn‚Äôt muster a decent attack for 30mins. Just hoofing long balls. This sub will keep sucking him off though because he says mate, speaks his mind and makes a joke.   The ideas behind his tactics are sound, but he isn't willing to make adjustments at all. Spurs doesn't even have such a bad group of players but he isn't willing to be pragmatic and play to suit the material. It all went downhill after they played Chelsea‚Ä¶ i swear we have some sort of curse on them lol Reverting to the early/mid 00s mean*   Was always gonna happen, exactly the kinda performance and result you'd get from a Redknapp/Jol team. They‚Äôll still blame those injuries though.   I think the measure of how a manager will do at the club is how he deals with adversity and comes back from it. Because at some point you WILL lose 2/3 games in a row. Those games can easily turn into worse form and then spirals from there. I always said last season I was impressed with Ange‚Äôs start but wanted to see what happened when they lost a few matches.   This is why I‚Äôm very curious how things will go for Slot now. They‚Äôve lost in poor fashion but if it‚Äôs a one off it‚Äôs fine. Ange Past it Coglu Am I missing something? Because I've seen a few people write this and it feels like it's underselling it.   We've more more times at their stadium in three seasons, or just a year and a half, than they have at ours in over 30 years.   I guess if you want to reduce it to just the Emirates though then yeah it's only 18 years. you should see the Chelsea-Tottenham head to head ‚ò†Ô∏è Nothing like flushing shite in the big toilet bowl üòÇüòÇüòÇ As is tradition though. They had fun during our banter era but let‚Äôs not act like they‚Äôre even close to being on the same level. Mind the gap lads. They don‚Äôt want to win. There‚Äôs no other explanation. Timber had a monster game against Son. Especially on a yellow for a considerable period of the game. Hats off to the defence today.   Special shout out to Nwaneri who had a bright cameo. Jesus and Sterling looked scratchy in comparison. Keeping in mind that even under peak Wenger there were no 2 straight wins at White Hart Lane. And that was back when they were a midtable team. Remember, a small club beat Totnum today. Big gabi on away days might be the best defender of all time. Guy definitely turns it up a level More than you believe. Good for you, you lot  deserve it  /srs if it looks sarcastic Amen brother. Amen. That's been us for like half a year now 11 players in the box does that. Lampard, is that you? Gabriel been the most underrated player this last full year. I LOVE Saliba and I even feel Gabriel has been unquestionably better. Either way it‚Äôs so awesome having the best cbs in the league. Never thought I‚Äôd enjoy defense so much Gab was phenomenal today. Legit 10/10 performance. I know right? I feel less nervous in a close game nowadays. What a strange feeling lol Respect Timber as well  If not for Gabi he would‚Äôve been my MOTM, was a wall himself today, and was great up front supporting Martinelli We deserve this after watching a bunch of fucking clowns at CB for so long. I used to dream of times like this. So many years of dross man‚Ä¶ Almunia, Fabianski, Squillaci, Senderos, Santos, Traore, Hoyte, Mustafi‚Ä¶  We‚Äôve got an embarrassment of riches in our back 5 now. Absolutely loving it. Modern ACL recovery methods have come a long way. If all goes to plan ACLs aren‚Äôt the bogeyman injury in the long term for a player as much anymore He just secured that starting LB spot. Calafiori for competition. Ajax technical training, robust physical profile and elite reading of the game. Dude bossed that left side. If we could get any one of Martinelli, Trossard or Sterling to be a solid starter, that left side is looking Hella juicy, especially needed after White's fairly poor showing today. Cant forget how he gave the ball away right in front of goal in first half I‚Äôm not joking, but he‚Äôs a better CB than a RB/LB, though he puts in a solid shift there as well. You should have seen him right after joining us in that summers pre season game he was our best player. Guy is of similiar quality to big gabi and saliba. I know he is doing great at LB/RB and won't start at CB over Saliba amd Gabriel right now but he is even better at CB than as a LB/RB. Gabriel was obviously MOTM, because of the goal, but if Gabriels performance was a 9 then Timber was 8,99. He was everywhere, very safe, threw some punches, marauded up top. excellent spatial awareness, definite upgrade over zinchenko Thought he was a bit unlucky not to get MotM I think we would've likely won if he was fit last year Yeah, I definitely feel like we‚Äôve gotten over that na√Øvet√© we had a couple seasons ago, where we‚Äôd often allow ourselves to get counterattacked way too easily. This team seems happy to just plug away in attack and grind out the win rather than force the issue too early and leave themselves open in transition. Ange needs to have the best team in the league as he's too stubborn to play the opposition Biggest difference between Ange and Arteta. Arteta realised we don‚Äôt have the players to take the game to them and adapted accordingly. Ange makes it so easy to prepare cause he does the same thing every time. I don't think conceding posession was intentional This is what happens every game with us, Arteta didn‚Äôt have a plan different to anyone else. I didn‚Äôt even notice since Spurs weren‚Äôt exploiting it. Which is weird because if anything Ange is meant to be good at attack. brentford are probably salivating watching this spurs high line tn Missing our Captain and starting midfielder in Merino too. And others like Zinny. We take the points and breathe Thing is it isn‚Äôt just Arsenal who can do this to us, West Ham, Newcastle, even Wolves do it.   We‚Äôre just so incredibly easy to play against. They didn‚Äôt even seem troubled at all. It‚Äôs awful stuff. > if they dropped points City would be so hard to catch  cmon, it's matchday 4. they could probably have 3 points after 4 matches and still everything on the table Copy? Mate he has over 200 appearances for David Moyes's Everton in the 2000s. He knows that shit better than anyone Wait until see what we do next week lol Arsenal went from the most entertaining team in the EPL to the least entertaining in about three years and still haven't won shit. Needs to be investigated. They never do in a derby. Wait, I thought Arsenal were the gooners. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA All for Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur We might as well be called Whiskey Dick FC. Couldnt finish in a brothel. Even Moyes was a better shout Timber for me. He was everywhere Pace in real life is not as important as it is in video games. These are experienced professionals - they know how to minimize their weaknesses, read the game, use angles to their advantage. It‚Äôs funny seeing Arsenal fans say this about Kai, when Chelsea fans did the same thing and we got a lot of shit for defending a ‚Äúbad‚Äù player who wasn‚Äôt scoring. (I‚Äôm not saying it came from Arsenal fans, just in general).   Not that I really care about that, it‚Äôs really just an observation haha. It was the strategy for the game. Imagine relying on Trossard, Jorginho and Partey as your midfield away from home on the biggest derby. The athleticism is lacking so much so we needed to just pack our midfield and take our chances. Yeah we could barely string a pass together but luckily Spurs were toothless Shite Hart Lame That was beautiful, man Unexpected succession Spurs fans keep saying this but let's be real, Maddison was not being effective at all. He has proven time and time again that he is not good enough to influence a game at this level. He really did look great. Shut down that left side and was everywhere on the pitch. Impressive performance So happy he looks as good as he did pre-injury Lads A short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us ‚Äòtake a monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car.‚Äô Thirty years later, Sebastian told us ‚ÄòI had to start my car like a computer, it‚Äôs very complicated.‚Äô And Nico Rosberg said that during the race ‚Äì I don‚Äôt remember what race - he pressed the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you both: is Formula One driving today too complicated with twenty and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future concerning the technical programme during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more communication with your engineers? It Be And they both played 90 mins.   Brain melting stuff, that. Says more about Spurs than us, honestly You played Dyche-ball today. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre surprised Still not the most embarrassing loss at home this weekend tho Honestly you could be right. They always score one counter attack goal. We were happy to allow them to play possession knowing they wouldn‚Äôt create anything haha And then shit myself laughing when I saw it went out because it hit Timo stood 5 yards offside Ange was my pick for the first manager to be sacked this season, for the reasons you mention. You were a revelation at the start of last season, but teams adapt when you always play the same and there are weaknesses. Ange has to realise you need to expand your tactics. Especially in the PL where other teams will figure you out. The amount of people last season who clowned on me for saying we missed him a lot last season need to see him in this game. Immense. More wins at new Tottenham stadium (3) since 2019 than they have at the Emirates since it opened lollll Absolutely bonkers stat, that. I still remember that loss. weren't we 2-0 up as well? more than they‚Äôve had in the emirates in nearly 2 decades btw I mean you‚Äôre just spitting facts [deleted] Was always gonna be cagey without our two balon d'or nominated midfielders starting.  The fact that mikel arteta found a way to win this game is unbelievable. If anything, it put more pressure on them to win, and they wilted.  Love it. I've seen a few claiming their CB pairing is the best in the prem Saw an Inter fan put him over Saliba cos of Saliba‚Äôs performance in the Nations League üòÇ I never understood the overhype about him, he's a decent defender who is hyper aggressive...I really didn't get all the comments that said Real will be all over him like he was the most in demand CB in the world right now lol He's like a bad version of Gabriel XL, he's super aggressive but doesn't have the quality to back it up, so he gets exposed But... Madrid want him uwu I don't watch spurs often but I swear ever time I do he does something that costs them a goal not even top 10 That conversation should never be entertained Romero's not even the best CB at Spurs. It's still hilarious how a modern meta better keeper was bought who ticks all the boxes and fans still thought Ramsdale would still start Raya has had an unbelievable start to the season. Gives the entire back line so much confidence Probably not, he's really excellent at that, especially the catching tehnique itself. And I'm not the biggest fan of Raya.  The thing which makes it even more funny is that Raya is most likely the tiniest GK in the league and among the shortest GKs in top-tier football. He's very unique in a way, because his height makes him *extremely* agile and quick, with an unusually high jumping reach. And he‚Äôs short for a keeper. Only 6‚Äù2. He‚Äôs been fantastic this season. 1-0 TO THE ARSENAL Pathetic how it was their most joyful match of their season. Odobert was more dangerous than Brennan Johnson with the little time he had  Bennan is an expensive useless player well ange did say they were going to play arsenal like they were any other team, which is exactly what they did with the same level of effectiveness they've had for the best part of a year. Also thought it was weird he was playing so deep. He got quite cheeky in and around the box, letting passes through and trying flicks but it was all flash and no substance. Our entire first choice midfield missing that, mate, is proper Angeball Ange told to cross and try to hit the best centerback pairing in north London, so spurs obliged He already admitted it, he was going to play any side the same way he'll play any side. Nothing was going to be adapted lol Cause they are shit, mate Because they sh*t Because we played fantastic. Fantastic defensive performance. Because we have the best defense in the world.   When it comes time to park a bus my god can we park it. I still can't believe Conte cut a promo essentially calling them a bunch of fuckin losers Shoutout to Timber as well, very solid and composed. You‚Äôre a Chelsea fan and talking shit??? What happened? Didn't expect an Arsenal fan to admit to it but yeah it was a bit ridiculous, even in the first half when it was 0-0 2-2 last year when they won the league in September They had the 2-2 at the Emirates early last season when Spurs were being talked up as genuine title contenders and that's about it. 1 draw 3 losses I think I think they were told to aim for the best centerback in north London for set pieces and rightfully kept crossing to Gabriel over Romero Crossing against the best goalkeeper with crosses omds It‚Äôs all they‚Äôve got I mean Arsenal‚Äôs was just to foul and score on a set piece I watched the whole game, can someone tell me what Bentancur did for ~60 minutes? I genuinely have no clue. Son was almost as invisible as well. Tbf they pocket Haaland too‚Äî Solanke had no chance He threw himself around a bit and nicked the ball off our midfielders. Was in the game, but yeah pretty nullified by our strong defense. Buzzing That guy is bang average no matter how much people try to sugarcoat it.He is good physically which people mistake it for hold up play when his touch is atrocious. He has looked clueless in both games he has played for spurs idk I heard a lot of cheering on the broadcast... Surely it wasn't that the Arsenal fans were outcheering the home crowd They wanted it last season, hopefully they continue getting it this one. Thank you, Bulbamew. Your contribution shan't be forgotten. Is FPL draft league like American style fantasy sports where other teams can‚Äôt have the same players as you? I‚Äôve always wanted that for football and never was able to find it. Did they just add that capability to FPL? wait till u heard about bird man I can't tell if his confidence is shot or if he's just rubbish. I haven't watched Bournemouth enough. > played a high line when down to 9 men against Chelsea.  Still irks me a little anyone dared to compliment them for being ""brave"" for doing that. Yeah they‚Äôve been quietly shit for a while and I‚Äôve seen hardly any headlines about it. Guess I‚Äôm just used to the thousands of ten hag headlines after every game we play. Yeah he is phenomenal. MotM for me. Very impressive performance all around. He got that dawg in him Yeah he's such a good gk, I'm surprised how good he's been this season. He evokes a ton of confidence for the team in both shot stopping and when it comes to cross collection. I absolutely don't miss Ramsdale's flailing. Their fans celebrated being best in some random stats THIS SEASON, only 3 games into it. Kinda reflective of their team's mentality ngl Because their team played yesterday against Brentford With our absolutely bodged midfield we knew it would be a sit back and hope for the best game. Probably be the same against City üíÄ So what you're saying is Ange is gonna revive the sleeping giant that is Everton. Ange ball is:  1. Have quick players with stamina and press high  2. ????  3. Profit  Works about half the time In fairness, Maddison made more passes than Odegaard today. We literally have a man mountain in the box in Gabriel and they put every delivery on his head. Genuinely bizarre About 5 times the cross was pretty much on the penalty spot and no player was within 10 feet. In fairness, the crossing from wide areas is about the best they got With all the yellows i was convinced it wouldn't stay that way I thought Kiwior would come on, with Timber shifting up to the wing. Glad Nwaneri seems trusted - he looks very tidy. Couldn‚Äôt take advantage of a physically washed Partey Jorginho is so underrated. People really think of him as he's about to retire or something. Your midfield is far more balanced than theirs, they were never going to out-play you. But everyone told me the ref had zero discretion and simply had to send rice off‚Ä¶ Love the argentinian league arsenal flair lol You had a push-off that resulted in the only goal of the match that went unpunished.  Be happy. lol has Rodri not started Solanke grabbing betancur on the goal which prevented him from jumping was also humorous. Proper Werner that But his runs are amazing and he create a lot of space and he presses a lot hes the perfect Ange player and his buy option is pretty cheap, seems like a no brainer massively overrated. unable to even match conte's record He‚Äôs not good enough.  He has a plan A and his Plan B is ‚Äúdo Plan A, but better‚Äù Agree, sadly. I‚Äôm not Ange out yet, but we have been mediocre to dreadful since halfway through last season. At first I thought some of Ange‚Äôs statements were just keeping things calm and collected in front of media, but thinking now that he‚Äôs just incredibly stubborn. We will not fare well in Europa if our approach doesn‚Äôt change. He played two 10s in the 8 spots. Sarr wouldn‚Äôt have been better against that parked bus than Kulu.  Kulu consistently runs more than anyone else in our team. Better passing from the 6 spot and better take-ons at RW are what we needed. Brennan got pocketed Issue isn‚Äôt whether there‚Äôs a set piece coach appointed or not, good idea but not the only way to fix things, issue is that their keeper looks terrified every corner. He‚Äôs got zero confidence and a terrible track record, this bleeds into the defenders who keep making rookie mistakes on them. Whether the guy to coach them out of bad habits is a specialist or general defensive coach is secondary to just knuckling down and doing the work.   Either way they cannot keep being so weak in and around both boxes. That will be what ends him. The bit between both boxes is often alright. It‚Äôs the keeper not set piece coach. He is small and refuses to come out for the ball This was far and away from the best Arsenal have played, even without their best midfielders. If I was a Spurs fan I'd be super bothered by this result. The trio of Raya, Gabriel, and Saliba is so clearly above the Tottenham defence. Gonna be honest dude right now that doesnt really mean a lot Probably why Brazil lose all the time I mean var let a clear full outstretched arm push freeing your goal scorer on a corner count‚Ä¶.thats how you got undeserved 3 points, if Romero went down like gabi does it would have been called off. Yet here we are with no team deserving more than a point but Woolwich gifted 3 points. Solanke was set up to fail.  1 good season and they spend what? 60 million pounds on him? Crazy behaviour They didn't even have a bottle... He had no idea where Gabriel was. Lost his man on a body feint That‚Äôs a big reason why it was a deserved no call. It‚Äôs one thing if Romero made an attempt to contest, but he just accepted the type of shove that happens on most corners ‚Äî I can‚Äôt count how many times I saw Kane do that and worse ‚Äî and meekly put his arms to the side after the goal, he didn‚Äôt even believe it himself. As an Arsenal fan I thought he was causing Gabriel and Saliba a bit of trouble in the first half he was winning a lot of the aerial long balls. But then didn‚Äôt really do much in the second half. Spurs fans maintain they have one of the best defences in the league but can‚Äôt understand why they concede so many shit goals Pedro Porro is a failed winger playing fullback, nowhere good enough defensively to merit playing fullback and nowhere threatening enough consistently to get the leeway he does If Spurs entries back line plus goalie merged into one human being they'd be a good football player. I saw spuds fans saying Porridge, Udigie, VdV and Vicario in a combined 11. The mind boggles¬† Porro is fucking dog water, every time I watch him play he fucking sucks. No clue how their fans think he‚Äôs even average I'm surprised Robbie didn't push back harder and stop him from putting 6 Spurs players into the combined XI. Also of their 15 shots, 6 were blocked. This is a superb metric He ain't even the biggest problem. Imagine spending 50m on Brennan Johnson, whoever had a part in that needs extreme punishment. He‚Äôs not worth anywhere near that. He‚Äôs scored 29 goals in over 135 appearances, he‚Äôs putting up Anthony Martial numbers. I laughed out loud at the pundits saying he was going to be one of the signings of the season. [deleted] He's decent but not worth that, it's just a symptom of how much money is in the PL now and how that fucks up the internal transfer market. Solanke is a good player. He did quite well today against the strongest CB pairing in the league. 60m is just what good, Premier League proven players cost. Maybe 10m too much. He‚Äôs just an older Eddie Nketiah No. But also don‚Äôt think like 75% of the players are worth their sell values. I‚Äôm holding out judgement until he gets a few months of games I thought Solanke looked good in the 1st half. Give him some time, it may come good. Nope, I think that if Solanke were to be worth even 50 million, he would have to be scoring 2 goals right around now. Seriously, I was so weirded out by Spurs fans trying to say that Solanke would be better than Ollie Watkins this season. Dominic Sowanky  He had one good season and got a big money move. Kinda crazy Think he‚Äôs the most likely player to face being replaced.¬†  He‚Äôs not bad but he just isn‚Äôt great, often makes the wrong decision in front of goal.¬†  We‚Äôve all been waiting for him to find his form for a few seasons but he‚Äôs never got there.¬†  Very good at running opponents into the ground, which is very useful but a bit one dimensional as a player.¬† last year against Sevilla He was great defensively though, credit where due. But yeah he has been wank for over a year now. He just has obligatory two good games against Liverpool and that papers over the cracks. But that's just TAA tax. On the positive side he works hard, especially when defending, and runs hard down the wing, which scares opposition.  He understands Arteta's highly structured tactics very well.  He's not perfect, but he does enough of all of it right.  But yeah, he should have found Saka for that pass when he shot instead.  But then again, he did break free,  i suppose. Hes been extremely poor for a while now and seems to get worse and worse. He just cant do the last ball final product/decision, I think he gets it wrong 9 out of 10 times.  For me, this is his last season to show something or we will have no choice but to replace him. Can‚Äôt think of another winger who is as dependent on other members of our starting 11 for end production than Martinelli. Like if Jesus isn‚Äôt starting, we can expect little to no production from Nelli. He‚Äôs a good player, but he doesn‚Äôt pick up his head and look up for that final ball either. He‚Äôs an incredibly frustrating player to watch IMO The last one I can honestly remember was the City win last year where he scored. He played decently all game and had the goal. He‚Äôs completely cooked right now >recently  For about the past decade.  We have had some good signings but it always feel like we don't solve the major problems that we have at any given time. You should have seen the hate I got here when I didn‚Äôt include him in my top 5 PL defenders Hey now put some respect on mustafi‚Äôs name. Only a little tiny bit, but yeah‚Ä¶ > Mustafi  I always wondered how on earth did he ever get a World Cup. You know while the game i had the thought that timo werner is the mustafi of forwards, consistent slapstick from that guy. Yes! They played great and therefore should continue playing the same way for the entire season! Gabriel is what Spurs fans think Romero is LMAO You probably won't get an attack as timid and toothless as this one was. Easy to cope with the loss when you can attack freely unburdened by the fear of conceding. We go and read with a nice coffee Wild that Spurs have just 2 league away wins against Arsenal in the PL era. We‚Äôve got more wins at their new stadium than they‚Äôve got wins away to us in all of the PL era No amount of big units up front is going to make spamming crosses against Gabriel and Saliba a good tactic.   Spurs looked at their most dangerous when they had Kulusevski and Maddison turning on the ball in the half-spaces.  Was Ange's in-game management this uninspired in Scotland as well? Or were you just blowing everyone else out of the water, and he didn't often find himself in those positions? Do many mates in the media I brought it up before. Got downvoted into oblivion for it.  Nobody is ready to have this discussion fairly. >At what point do his credentials start to come into question?  Probably the same amount of time and spending Arteta got before becoming competitive. even with context that was a ridiculous statement to make Ian Wright said it could be a possibility had Romero gone down. Shearer said no chance that's a foul. we would play similarly with them on the team, thats just the gameplan vs spurs The best part about it, is it fucking worked ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Johnson is awful so.. Sorry brother... That's tough. Glad to hear you found a reason to smile today. COYG Sorry to hear such sad news my friend! This game definitely isn't anywhere near as important, but glad that the game gave you happiness during such a dark time for you and your family. Bless! So sorry for your loss Sorry for your loss brother. My heartfelt condolences to the missus as well, take care of her as this must be a very trying time for her as well. So sorry to hear that! My grandpa passed last night as well, safe to say this win meant a whole lot to us struggling gunners as a lovely bright spot in an otherwise tough weekend So sorry to hear this mate. But you know the drill. We move! Get in the box again and finish. I know in 9/10 months we will have another Gabi in the world! Much love my dude! Sorry for your loss. Stay strong and keep moving forward! That's proper shit mate, sorry you're both going through that. This is why I want Arsenal to be great, just makes life a bit more enjoyable. Had a shit last few months of 2022 myself but our insane run at the time made things better. So sorry to hear. I'm sure after you mourn, you're still gonna come back stronger and have a beautiful baby together Sorry for your loss I'm so sorry, my friend; I've been there as well. Most important thing is that you're there for your girlfriend because she needs you now more than ever. But also know that it's no one's fault and that miscarriages are more common than people realize. Hold onto each other a little longer, a little tighter, and you'll both get through it. Sorry for your loss, both of you. Hugs from another Arsenal fan. Damn. Love to you and the gf man. Just spursy things. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Well Spurs fans always say teams don't turn up against us, guess they didn;t either. Ange wanted to treat this game as any other, so they played like their usual level They need to sack Coglu and get a real manager. Playing Romero as ST in the last 10 minutes of the game means you're out of ideas. Spurs are easy to play against, just sit deep. Classic Impostecoglou Took an existing slander name and just made it worse lol Actually rolls off the tongue pretty good lol This is brilliant lol Let‚Äôs not be sarcastic about their possession based crossing game. Let‚Äôs praise it genuinely. It‚Äôs so fucking good, it makes me cry. despite Liverpool‚Äôs showing yesterday, I‚Äôd take Slotball over Angeball Slot would flop at Tottenham too, idk how people still think it‚Äôs the manager at this point. Everyone who goes there to manage is deemed a failure I saw that bench and feared the absolute worst > Our setpiece issues have been resolved (which is one of your main tactics),   > I am legitimately expecting we smash you lot, and I have not felt this way going into the NLD in a *longgg* while.  Brilliant Story of the season thus far. Hope it clicks soon. Bro died mid sentence from the boredom of watching inverted conteball Ange is incredibly easy to defend against. Ange only knows one way to play and can‚Äôt adapt spurs score in transition and thats basically it, a decent block and they just have 0 ideas He is no where near top 6 level. He just passes the ball back all the time. Doesn't create anything or can beat his man. He's a terrible signing.  Tottenham replaced Kane with average players. I don't think Solanke is top 4 level either. 100%, I have genuinely never seen him put in a decent ball or decent shot in big game I‚Äôve seen him in Whenever I watch him I agree, but the numbers say otherwise Honestly surprised timber played the full 90. Thought he would be subbed off tbh considering he played a bit during international break and just came back from a major injury. Tbh thought he would be subbed off for the next few games before playing a full 90 but looked great Are you kidding, with our midfield completely out we were pretty even, this was excellent. Also it's an away game at spurs that's not a cake walk Wait, so you don‚Äôt believe Messi when he said Romero is the best defender in the world? Someone said it well that Ange's plan B is ""do plan A, but better."" Tongue in cheek aside it seems like it's a comment rooted in a degree of accuracy.   TBD whether the inability to pivot to another approach is due to the manager or the personnel or both. Quick someone put the ketchup back in the table If everyone team‚Äôs strategy is to park the bus, I‚Äôm more than happy to play this way. Bergvall, Odobert, and Gray will thrive in those conditions. Kulu also looks good in these games.  We need time and a RW who can beat his man Tough to choose between Madrid, Inter and, Arsenal's defense imo. Definitely in the conversation. Saliba is one of the best in the world. Today was not a good day for anyone that had ‚ÄúVan den Ven is better than Gabriel‚Äù agenda Yes its atleast top three  actually if you mean strictly back 4 then yes     EDIT: I thought you were talking about arsenal If you‚Äôre going to criticize anyone criticize our attackers Was this a debate or something? I don't think I've heard anyone even compare them before in my life. Van de ven is still very young and I thought today was great. I love how spurs fans circle back around to this opinion every second season It's not like Arsenal were amazing either. You had plenty of half chances, the decision in the final third by your lot is fucking awful mind. The worst thing about spurs is the entitlement of spurs fans.  It‚Äôs not even like ye have any glory days to be pining for.  Ye are what ye are! I think if the tottenham fans and the team would openly consider focusing on carabao cup, fa cup or europa league there would be a fair fight. Competing against city and arsenal for a bigger title is not on the menu and won't be for the next few years. Think of all the laughs your club has been providing for fans all over the globe tho. That must count for something What do you think of shit? There‚Äôs still time to support the correct team. You all put a cock on a ball and thought you‚Äôd be winning things.   Wenger had you by the balls, we just took a quick break and now Arteta has you by the balls. üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ Poor quality crosses into the box it seems Fully agreed. This one felt the best. Tbf if we could only score one against Leicester then the best defence in the league playing deep ain‚Äôt gonna struggle. They played Dyche-ball Told my dad yesterday to expect a 1-0 or a 0-0 because of Arsenal‚Äôs likely lineup. Arsenal a lot better than the Europa league teams to be fair, but the same could be said with Liverpool last season and we just couldn‚Äôt find a way to consistently score on low block teams.   Personally I think set pieces are a lot more pivotal against the low block than what teams are utilizing/capitalizing on. But I‚Äôm no expert. Nah.  Nothing a few well placed ""mates"" and press conference zinger can't fix. Without Rice, Odegaard, Merino, Zinchenko, Calafiori and Tomiyasu. With the circumstances, injuries, etc this is a massive win for Arsenal. The lack of midfield was apparent and Arsenal really need to sort out their LW situation but this will be a massive relief for Arteta. Oh look, the Juventus fan oddly obsessed with Ange. Back again. So weird‚Ä¶ It's not even attacking football. It's more like - let's stuff all the players in the opposition half and then hope the other team crumbles from our pressure. They build up nicely and then what. No counter attacks, no risks with the ball from attacking players because the line is so high that any turnover will cause a 2v2 going back. Give Spurs some credit though they are shit. To be fair, their game plan was also absolute ass. They just floated crosses in against the best defensive pairing in the League. It‚Äôs a dog fight out there, dog.   Greatest Turner contribution to Arsenal‚Äôs history lol Son's barely recognisable... I‚Äôm with you.  I properly called out Romero last season being an overrated liability and spurs fans absolutely downvoted me.  Spurs fans are delusional.  They are such a mediocre side. I swear Messi gives one compliment to a friend of his and people start taking it as gospel. ‚ÄúBest defender in the league‚Äù, he‚Äôs not even been the best in London since he came to Tottenham because of Thiago Silva/Saliba/Gabriel Shhh! Athletic is coming with Romero best defender in League article. Romero is properly rated. Maddison and Vic are over rated Well it was a midfield two and yes the point was to win despite the midfield 2 senior citizens as holding midfield  their sprint is my jog I mean what is interesting is how Arsenal adopted to having a weak midfield. Midfield has been one of their strong points lately, but going into this game and knowing that they will have to use a second-string midfield, they changed up their tactics to utilise the defence and wings a lot more. Yes but let‚Äôs play Johnson instead. Fucking joke and clueless‚Ä¶ Much more dangerous than Johnson. He actually did well for the time we saw him üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ üòÇüòÇüòÇ That wasn‚Äôt arsenal, that was prime Stoke And their only win is against the bottom team that has no points So refreshing how good we are at defending. Proper 1-0 to Arsenal today. The terrifying memories of Sokratis, Mustafi, Kolasinac, Cech and many others are slowly being erased‚Ä¶ the banter era wasn‚Äôt fun. You mean the extremely unlikely header that was close to going in? Yh I think you‚Äôre being a bit harsh. Just getting the ball towards the goal from there with Saliba pressuring him was impressive enough. Walker Bellerin u/tottenhamnole if you want to end the curses you gotta pick up 321nole's mistake and eat da poo poo Haha, when did he get suspended? No wonder I haven't seen him around lately That FSU fan on Twitter has to eat dogshit, it‚Äôs the only way to break the curse FSU just abysmal this year. My friend who flew from Florida to Ireland for the GT game was in tears Honestly without much of a midfield, we were there for the taking suicidal high line High line for the sake of it. Have the ball and do nothing with it. Last 15 mins throw Romero in the box, cross and inshalla. Cross and Inshallah ""Just run abaht a bit."" Where managers go to die. Nwaneri getting minutes away in a North London derby at 17 Arsenal were just straight up bad.  Against biggest rivals.  Still won 1-0.  We take those. Surprised im not reading this more, feel like he was the only one who realized we had a lead and tried to protect the ball last 15 min. Gabriel and sterling meanwhile trying to dribble thru 5 players We dominated the midfield. But not much else.  No point in dominating the midfield if you‚Äôre stuck in the final third.  Arsenal could have played kids in the midfield with not much change. Kulu, Sarr, and Udogie (for some parts of the match) impressed me today. 1st half Spurs were good. Second half Arsenal slowed things down and set the tone of the game. I think Sarr did well too Push from Gabriel on Romero before his header ok calling him Australian Big Sam is not being fair to Big Sam They cemented themselves as top 4 for a few seasons but that‚Äôs the best they‚Äôve done in the Prem era Will Spurs fans then admit that last season v Chelsea was the most embarrassing tactical performance in years? > the Australian Sam Allardyce  This is the dumbest fucking comparison I've ever seen. Johnson isn't English. He has the concept of an attack This is all on Ange. Our midfield didn‚Äôt exist today and it shoulda been an onslaught on shots on our goal. First 15 min looked like that honestly. i‚Äôve been saying that he lowkey deserves the praise Saliba gets (not that the latter is bad, far from it) but because he doesn‚Äôt look as good doing his job,  he doesn‚Äôt get the credit he deserves Arguably 3 with Merino out as well, but that‚Äôs speculative 3 best midfielders arguably I‚Äôm here for it üòÇ Sorry I thought Arsenal‚Äôs lowest usually comes in March and April when they choke away the league I think it because Madi lost in form Sadly there is no such thing as title contention anymore. Are you genuinely Ange out? His a good coach but you won't win anything with him. All out attack is fun to watch and all but you need to know how to defend to win also First half was entertaining af, second half less so I guess only if looking to the scoreline. there was a lot of back and forth all game long. Arsenal just lacked more composure to finish the counters and it couldve been easily 3-0. tottnum also choked a few gifts by making terrible decisions or not making any decision at all (solanke 65m lmao) The most important thing happened. We got 3 points. Trust me, this is when it all comes together That botched clearance/control in the box near the end had me screaming. Fucking hell, man! Please Merino hurry back I thought he was better than Jorginho today at least. Jorge missed the ball in transition at least twice, it could have been bad news if our defence was not on it today and if Spurs weren‚Äôt shit You mean essentially telling your players ""it's just a game, don't worry so much about winning this particular one"" wasn't a great strategy?? They were flaccid They‚Äôre poor defensively and they just try and maintain possession. But they‚Äôre not really able to create any chances with that and they just get to the final 3rd and then look clueless. Arsenal were happy to let them play like that and once the goal went in, it became even more obvious Spurs things I had Saka and Gabriel so a nice +18 for me. Need Gordon and Isak to run riot and I'll sleep a very happy man. Arsenal fans keep repeating this as if your entire backline don't act like that every single game too. I don't mind owning up to the fact that some of our players do it, but it goes both ways lmao It's literally all anyone talks about with Spurs. The only recent change is that people started adding mate to the end of their jokes Out of the few things I know about spurs as an Aussie watching it‚Äôs that they haven‚Äôt won trophies because it‚Äôs all that is said. Pay attention mate.¬† It gets talked about a lot but it is ridiculous they are classified as being in the ‚Äúbig six‚Äù. They have single league cup in the last 30 years. I think people talk about spurs having no trophies a TONNE. But you‚Äôre right not enough It is talked about an extraordinary amount lol what rock have you been under this century No Calafiori Nah, Ange is class, Spurs are just rotten. We had 2 geriatric men in midfield and still made a decent amount of chances to score The entire first choice midfield was out for Spurs away - play compact, keep the chances down get a goal from a set piece advantage go home with 3 points. We weren‚Äôt close to our best and you can see how many players are out by how many teenagers are on the bench. In that context this was a massive performance. Patch work midfield will do that to you. Was always going to be brute footy without Rice or Ode. Timber, Calafiori, White, Kiwior can all play there. Wouldn‚Äôt be the same partnership as Saliba Gabriel but we can cope with an injury in that position imo Toney would have been the better purchase sooo a perfect fit then? IT'S Liverpool is irrelevant let‚Äôs be honest They had two players out lmao. After spending hundreds of millions for years. And got outplayed to shit and lucky af He‚Äôs been there for a while. They started last season well but they lost steam after that and they looked incredibly mediocre. Their subreddit was pretty angry with a model that predicted that Chelsea would finish above them but the truth is that Pochettino‚Äôs Chelsea were playing much better football than Spurs were in the second half of the season He's had a whole year, why hasn't he fixed all the problems!?!   /s > Ruined their whole week I reckon  Normal week for a Spurs fan 3 times in a row. You can‚Äôt ruin that which has no hope They‚Äôd have to be pretty used to it by now pUmPEd!!!!! You beat them 0-1 dawg not 0-4 Tell us about it! Our game plan was very simple. Just sit back and defend and hit them on the break and play for set pieces. In fact that's how Spurs have lost most of their games this season and last season ‚ÄúVery poor‚Äù is a bit of an exaggeration. We lacked a bit of creativity and Rice‚Äôs coverage but that starting XI was still more than good enough to win that game. The back 4 is probably the best in the league as a unit, and the front 3 was business as usual. Other than the corner, Romero was actually decent. He's not on Saliba or Gabriel's level. He's reckless and always looks unbothered with a time bomb of a temper. Reminds me of Lissandro Martinez. One World Cup, two Copa Americas. Soon in white. Romero‚Äôs 2022 WC >>>> saliba/gabriel last 2 seasons >Delete the club and turn the stadium into a neutral concert arena.  Hey! Don't forget they also use it for NFL games and F1-sponsored events! Tbh you could say that for most teams. City are the only team guaranteed to win silverware. Raya has been ridiculous this season. Saved us against Villa, had a great save against Wolves on 0-0. So glad Tottenham went for Vicario instead of Raya. Raya plays with a billion dollar Burnley setup in front of him lmao, he‚Äôs not stiff competition at all Top 1 I was seeing disrespect on his name due to a Nations League performance, better than Romero they said ü§£ Only small teams want their team to lose an miss out on CL football to spite their rivals Not as bad as Chelsea yesterday It's Tottenham ITS Let's also not forget, no Zinchenko or Tomi! nah, disagree. Officiating today was overall pretty good. Didn't get everything right, but majority seemed fine and didn't make any awful mistakes. Yeah two handed pushes in the back are fouls but Gabriel and Saliba get away with it all game every match Don‚Äôt remind me of away 2022 put a lil respect on partey. he did well to make it through the game No see we need Werner walking to the back post or not being bothered to fucking jump out of the way of a shot attempt more than developing one of the best young talents in the past few years. Maybe we would have if you hadn't iced Clarke so hard he could've been found next to a mammoth SHIT üí© SHIT Son I guess Liverpool have taken plenty of players from lesser prem teams who've been world beaters for them..? Spurs had 1 shot on target first half. Don't let possession numbers confuse you. The first half was pretty even with us having better opportunities, but Tottenham having more of the ball. he's like the direct opposite of Mourinho. Ange is an attacking manager with a recklessly aggressive press (like arsenal 2 years ago) combined with a very high defensive line and utilizing attack focused defenders.  Jose is a defensive manager but a rock solid and deep-sitting defense, with an attack usually carried out by only 3-4 attack-minded players (a CAM, wingers and striker).  Also, Ange doesn't adapt game plans while Mourinho is well known to adapt to nearly every opposition. Feels like he's too stubborn for his own good. Even after getting the starting XI wrong, the game was there for you with the right adjustments. I'm certainly glad to have edged it, but I think Ange's in-game management leaves something to be desired and you often suffer for it. You can be managed by Guardiola himself - you aren't succeeding with those attackers. Sononymous Don't think so. Let‚Äôs pump the breaks. Ange got more points from his first season than Arteta did in his first with Arsenal. It‚Äôs a process. Pressures on to get it to come together, but still has the chance to keep building. Besides he could win a European trophy this year which is something Arsenal could never do. That‚Äôs not even our B midfield. That‚Äôs our apocalypse right there. Rice and Odegaard out at the same time is insane. Probably one of Gillet's better games. There was a slight home team bias I would argue. Van De Ven should've went off by ""tHe LEtTeR of THe LaW"" for a shirt pull on Havertz which Gillet somehow ""missed"" despite standing in the perfect position. Gillet was card happy but applied it equally to both sides   I am one of his biggest haters, but I think he did an oky job, at least there was consistency Terrible, but I don‚Äôt think it was bias tbh. I think Gillet just didn‚Äôt handle the moment of the NLD and got carried away in the first half. Some bad calls in the second to make up for it, but outside of missing a VDV clear and obvious pull on Havertz preventing the break, pretty equal opportunity shit refereeing towards both teams. Giving Saliba a yellow for ""preventing a restart"" was a dogshit decision made even more dogshit by the inevitable failure to give the exact same decision the other way.  Other than that, no real controversies. Very card happy. Handed out a lot in both directions. Overall not sure there was anything too controversial though.¬† It was bad both ways... but not horrible Terrible the first half, I thought the second half was alright Horrid, bookings were being handed like crazy. No way we played better than Arsenal. Today was a simple demonstration of quality difference. Possession‚â†playing better Spurs DNA do not even attempt to insult Brendan Rodgers lmao Brendan Rodgers won an fa cup with Leicester. Did about as well at celtic as ange too. Rodger‚Äôs won a trophy and managed one of the best attacking Liverpool sides we‚Äôve seen, Ange has done nothing üí© Do that on ultimate team and you'll have 12yr olds threatening to come round and fire bomb your house. 24 was the first FIFA I bought since 15. Only reason I got it was because Konami ran PES into the ground lmao.   I'm not buying again, even though it does have the new Arsenal kits... We miss Ode badly Putting on Werner for Maddison against a low block is worth a sacking on its own They play some boring football. Nobody knows what to do other than passing backwards or sending in a shite cross When did the high line even go close to costing us? Yeah, I had this exact discussion with a mate the other day. Our squad is pretty mediocre and we're miles off it how was Solanke? An elite coach needs to adapt his style to the talent level of his squad though‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure Ange would cook with Arsenal, City or Liverpool but he‚Äôs not lucky enough to have landed with these kind of players! Raya is such an upgrade on Ramsdale it's not even funny. Feels good having a calm collected presence in the back. We had no legs in the midfield which is essential for what we do in cutting off opposition from time and space on the ball, jorgi and partey are always 3 steps behind the play. Good enough first half but the second half was more of stay compact and play for a set piece or a moment. What did you expect? Missing our entire starting midfield away from home in a derby. Spurs offered nothing - defensive masterclass imo I hope not, imagine having another team that could actually beat us when playing at home. Rather have the 3 points Many are wondering¬† We are but our starting midfield was out and we were playing away no one does, mate Relax you had 2 starters missing We won a NLD with half our team missing and you want to criticise the manager??? I hear you but he managed the game well. Can‚Äôt complain too much given our injury list. In general maybe, but we were forced to play a really weakened side and the plan was working. The options on the bench weren't really there, so why fuck things up? Well, we were playing literal shit, so Not really - the first half should have gone Arsenal way, and after the goal in the second half Tottenham really only had half chances. For at team without 5 first team players, that's as deserved as it can be. How many teams in Europe missing their entire starting midfield would go away to Spurs and play on the front foot?  Partey and Jorginho had absolutely nothing left by the end of this match . He's been watching Simeone for sure. Lmao what? They've spent loads A Chelsea fan telling people that their team hasn‚Äôt spent enough on their squad is quite possibly the most comical thing I‚Äôve read all day. They‚Äôve spent more than Arsenal since Ange arrived Buddy, we have the third highest expenditure over the last five years, with a large number of players brought in being U21. Levy has invested a ton, and not all of it is expected to pan out right away. Maybe look at the facts before parroting garbage you hear online. They‚Äôve spent quite a bit, but on shit players. Brennan Johnson is not worth 50 million and Solanke is definitely not worth 60. With that kind of money you can get yourself a striker that has had more than one good season in the Premier League. I mean best chance of them winning a trophy is Europa conference league. What‚Äôs the point of top 4. Hhhhhy Didn‚Äôt they signed Gray for 40m just to have him on the bench for 90 minutes? [deleted] Week bait lol Spurs are toothless offensively (only Everton can make them look offensively amazing) and Arsenal have the best defence in the league   Wasn‚Äôt sure we‚Äôd win, in fact I kinda thought a draw was more likely, knew it would be a tough game but never thought Spurs would embarrass us Never bet on Spurs. They‚Äôre disappointment impersonate And somehow got worse when Werner, Sterling and Jesus came on. My guy Son and Solanke have played 2 games together pump the brakes Brennan Johnson is the bigger issue. Dude sucks. We can fix him Balding fraud I can also confirm we‚Äôre 4 games in. Good god. Vicario is made of paper, Maddison is made of glass and son is over the age curve. Hard to say theure top 4 quality consistently anymore Happiness isn't an excuse for ignorance btw. Don't know if you know that. Unfortunately the same can be said for the Newcastle match. I think Ange is safe because Tottenham LOOKS good. But the chips aren't falling currently. [deleted] Was it fuck. Tottenham had absolutely no chance of scoring today. We could keep playing now and they still wouldn‚Äôt score. I don't think that means what you think it means They didn‚Äôt look good, we just sat back but they looked average they didn‚Äôt look good mate In what universe did spurs look good üòÇ Tottenham did not look good at all. We looked fine in everywhere but the final third if that‚Äôs what he means lmao Good lad here, worrying for other team a lot, and no offence I am not defending anyone [deleted] At least we bought the rapist we didn‚Äôt develop him Irrespective of or regardless Irregardless? Lol Shoves?? It‚Äôs less of a ‚Äúshove‚Äù on Romero and more of an easy little wander away into space. VDV is so impressive. I don‚Äôt know if there is a faster defender in the league. The amount of times he covered the other side of defense was insane Second derby spurs fans calling for ""shoves"" vicario now romero.  No your players are just weak Son‚Äôs cooked. Should have sold him two years ago when you could‚Äôve got something for him You'd have scored if you only sent in another 20 crosses. Lucky the entire midfield were out or we'd have bent you lot over again. Yeah, he'd do anything for 3pts Honestly with the players we had out, it may be like the teams Dyche coached lol That was Jesus lmao. He did it once, the other time it was Jesus Sterling was bad but this is his debut tbf, the bad habits will get coached out of him pretty soon by Arteta If my grandma had wheels, she would be a car Arsenal was unimpressive and yet won this game comfortably.  Ange needs to right the ship or leave. I think cross number 32 really could have turned the game on its head, you're right. Lucky we managed to keep them at 31. Spurs created 0 good chances. Let them fly balls into the box all day long. When you have a goalkeeper who is great at collecting crosses and big defenders who can make the most of their physicality, you take those spray and pray crosses easily. Didn‚Äôt really have a solid chance all game. Approach play was fine, but basically nothing happened with any of it. I think that was the strategy tho. If you lose a controlling midfielder then it makes sense to try and counter on them. With Gabriel saliba and raya too I bet they could‚Äôve launched 1000 more crosses and not scored one why? We are far more fluid than the England team that‚Äôs such a disrespectful comparison man üò≠ Playing without Odegaard and Rice will do that to you. Having Jorghino and Partey in the midfield is very weak comparatively. It should be studied on why this rattles fans as much as it does. Unreal it's complained about as much as it is. Can't even beat your biggest rival when they have a depleted and heavily injured side at your own stadium lol Go to a full strength rival with a heavily depleted midfield, create better chances and win based on a stellar defensive display üëç Arsenal weren‚Äôt playing West Ham today? Cope Spurs and FSU I'm sorry lad Solid tactical plan from tottenhamnole. Watch a massive club comfortably beat his, cry about how Tottenham were actually better, and hope to nick the pity upvotes on a bait comment. Massive? A massive club would have done better against this midfield lol. We didn‚Äôt have a choice. We don‚Äôt have a midfield rn Our three starter midfielders were out for this match. We didn't have much of a choice. We were always going to be dominated in midfield. Beats Ange's master plan of creating nothing and also defending terribly. Lmao Difference is when Arsenal was dominating possession they were also naturally generating loads of xG. Nothing spurs does in possession generates any kind of goal threat You need to focus on trying to beat Bournemouth on the weekend pal.¬† Breaking news: Best team in the world would play well against a team without their entire first choice midfield lmao Liverpool fans are the most ass-blasted fan group on Reddit, I swear. This arsenal team doesn't have ode rice , merino Focus on Liverpool mate ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Well, if they don‚Äôt I would have some serious doubts about Pep considering our midfield situation lmao You look emotional mate. How did you lose to Forest at home? worry about your own squad Still not over yesterday bud? Just like last season? Oh wait Nuno's tricky reds ran circles around you at Anfield yesterday Every game is different are you new to football? Brentford were dominating City at the Etihad for 25 mins and could have been 3:0 up. Spurs literally didn't make Raya even sweat just useless possession which is what Arsenal wanted Rent free in weird take but ok I think they can if they don't try and fight City at their own game, play out of possession with a compact defense, and hit them in transition.  If they were fully healthy I‚Äôd say go at them but they‚Äôre not. Hahahahahahahahahaha c*nt I had to go back and see the goal in case I used something but this post is hilarious ragebait. One was a nudge and one was a dry hump pushing his head down and climbing on his back. What actually caused the goal was Solanke grabbing betancur‚Äôs arm to prevent him from jumping enough to clear it. If you consider that a push, then you must stop watching football immediately. You can't be referring to [this!](https://www.specsavers.co.uk/) LOL, you are a funny man Missing a ton of players away at Tottenham... Coming from an Atletico fan is crazy, mate your team should be tried for crimes against humanity. Watch another game where Rice and Odegaard are on the field. It is really entertaining when they play their best 11.¬† That‚Äôs how i felt watching us play against atletico in that europa league game You lot need to finish your plate; all that possession for what? Pathetic amount of chances created. Keep ‚Äòem coming. Lovely stuff Was a small nudge and before the ball was even played I think. Better than copying Brendan Rodgers ü§£ Playing without 2 key players, won, made chances, rock solid defensive -> shit. Oh well Arsenal were playing a Jorginho-Partey-Trossard midfield, we‚Äôre missing our literal starting three I wouldn't say that just yet, our squad is rather thin right now  However it will take proper hard graft to overcome city with their current form You seem like you were dropped on your head repeatedly. üòÇüòÇ Which is why City beat Arsenal last season right? We were missing our entire midfield. What did you want? We didn‚Äôt have a midfield what do you expect Correct, which is why they didn‚Äôt. Agreed, spurs didn‚Äôt really create anything clear cut and were poor at defending set pieces. Arsenal nicked it with just being solid and clinical Sure, a draw would probably have been fair but we can't be that indecisive and expect to get away with it. Same as with Newcastle and Leicester Team that conceded the least goals with the highest scoring premier league defender is probably the best back 4. God you‚Äôre dumb In the world or Prem? In Prem yes they do. They are the best defensive unit and their CB pairing is world class. White is top 3 for sure and Timber just joined -like a new signing- and he has been solid up and down the field. Who would you argue has a better back 4? Most clean sheets last season, least goals conceded and least goals conceded this season so far. How is that a criminal take, when it's probably the truth? People lie but numbers don't. You writing this when this is not only mathematically true over the past year or so, but directly after a game where they kept a clean sheet is criminal. He‚Äôs correct mate  That‚Äôs why we conceded the least goals last season Comfortably? How is that even disputable.... Conceded the least goals in the league last season? Only for City can a case be made that they have a better defense. Best in the league last season on several metrics with our preferred LB missing the entire season, hardly criminal. How about you suggest whose is better and why? Who has a better back four right now? In the league Arsenal have only conceded three away goals this calendar year. This is such a delicious amount of salt. Please cry harder. Hilarious¬† Hahahaah   Romero had no idea where Gabriel was. Not a foul at all, you aren‚Äôt allowed to feign a foul if you let your man go and he jumps under 0 pressure A llorar a casa :) üòÇüòÇüòÇ Keep crying buddy HOLD DAT Win against your big rivals.  See their fans crying in the chat over fantasy controversies.  Gooners having a great day. I remember Spurs fans laughing at the Arsenal fans whinging last week, oh how the tables have turned! Don't forget they spent ¬£47.5m on Brennan Johnson. Such a terrible transfer [deleted] God damn that would be a glorious amount of gummies Coulda gotten the sugar free ones and the team would still shit the bed less than current > Honestly should have just bought 80 million bags of Haribo.  That sounds like one hell of a shit.  Big enough to fill the toilet bowl stadium. Facts, his crosses were a genuine threat, after that they just crossing and praying. Could barely even be bothered to boo Partey Hard to get turned up in a wedding hall you‚Äôve lost twice in a row into your local rivals. Spurs fans knew what was coming today, was clear from kickoff Natural ambiance? As opposed to what? I was at this fixture at the tail end of last season and your fans were dead quiet for most of the game. Granted we were on the other end of the ground from your ‚Äúkop‚Äù but the support near the away end was abysmal. Seemed like there were plenty of tourists in the crowd as well. Feel like it‚Äôs been that way all season, like they‚Äôre nerfing the crowd noise. Noticed it on Sky a bunch, first time I noticed it on BEIN (which uses the PL‚Äôs international broadcast) today too. Yeah we do cross, but surely you realise we have much better options to do and also a better threat to mix things up to open that up.   I don‚Äôt even think spurs tried anything tricky intricate. They shit themselves and just resorted to putting in to one person in the box. The issue I take is they had crosses into box into Solanke, with nobody around him. It was so easy for Gabriel and Saliba. It‚Äôs also not even just an issue for today. Multiple teams find a way to limit spurs easily It was just bad crosses against probably the best duo of cbs in the air in the world surely they could have had more runners from midfield try and generate some cutbacks or something Selling him for 50m and then buying CHO for like 5m is some unreal business from Forest. GTFO, no way did he cost 50  Edit: shiiiiiit. ¬£47.5 m. Wow. Antony isn‚Äôt that good Antony wishes he was as good as Brennan Johnson lmao Sounds like us under Wenger at the latter stages (don't get me wrong Wenger is forever my favorite manager of all time). Viccario is a great keeper, but his decision making on corners is terrible Reminds me of us in 22/23 in that respect but without the killer edge or control when our complete dominance ebbed.  It‚Äôs like watching the ‚Äúbut what if this happens instead‚Äù version of that team. Our 2 best chances were when solanke got the ball from the press at 15 and didn‚Äôt shoot  Then there was one where son and Maddison both chose to pass sideways instead of shooting at the edge of the box Kulusevski early, but nothing really after that. Same old story. Yeah by the end they basically had no ideas other than shoot from 30 yards out. He was pretty awful today too. Could have easily squared it to the free man back post around the 90' minute to put the game to bed but tried to dribble instead. Pretty woeful nowadays I really like how he‚Äôs looking, very composed and sharp *Havertz might get more min vs atlanta Sure, but he has done something similar in the past. He also had 2 more subs available.  Kiwor at lb and Timber into the middle seemed almost inevitable at some point. Specially with Jorginho on a yellow Our only senior cb and full back option today I‚Äôm not saying it was the wrong approach. I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt do it, considering how often he did these kind of subs last season That shot from Odobert looked like it was heading for the bottom corner until Werner got in the way. Blocked the equaliser His drop off in the last few years has been shocking Bro couldn't handle the pressure of being the main man of Sunday dinners anymore Should have been the main man of Sunday derbies instead He does this every season even at Leicester. Start good > turn into shit. Sometimes maybe he'll become good again at the end of the season when it's basically over, but also sometimes maybe not.  Well except this season i guess, where he's started shit.   He's also injury prone which plays a part in this pattern. Great story there mate tell another Maddison was class before he got injured last season and just hasn't looked like the same player since then. Maddison hasn't done much in about a year now, he can't be that far away. I put Odobert in because there were a few breaks that he just sucked the urgency out of The possibilities are endless Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Goal you get into lot of good positions but somehow instead of shooting it add 2-3 more touches for defenders to go back You would have kept Veliz for this. The guy was the king of ""give me the ball to shoot or head it when you need a goal"" at my team It‚Äôs full starting strength tbh, though I reckon in the NLD Tomi would get the nod ahead of Timber if he were fit. yeah his replacement really wouldnt accept no for an answer And Zinchenko   And Tierney Ah yes, Odegaard the notorious defender I‚Äôm actually really excited for him but yeah I‚Äôve watched his whole career so I know what to to expect lol I think that shit was good, just one to many.¬† No unfortunately that‚Äôs just the way he plays Vicario is one of the worst goalkeepers at defending set-pieces I‚Äôve ever seen. He looks terrified every time a defender steps close to him. Ange was quizzed on it multiple times at the end of last year and said it wasn't something that bothered him. Said he would work on it if he felt it would make them better. I think you need to be a bit stubborn to be a top manager but that's just stupid Also did he ever relent on being dead set against having a set piece coach? If not, surely they have to really be considering bringing one in by now. We were pretty poor at defending set pieces under ange too We were very bad. It‚Äôs still our worst trait today Very few teams in Scotland really attack Celtic. Its just them parking the bus whilst Celtic launch attack after attack after attack. In Europe they weren't amazing defensively They don‚Äôt need a set piece coach mate Celtic manager is probably one of the easiest jobs in football, impossible to compare regardless¬† Take off their main/only creative midfield outlet in Maddison too. Yeah, late they were taking tons of pot shots. Couple decent hits but there were definitely a few that would have me wound up if my club were down. Johnson has been shit since moving to Spurs. Set piece is shite, Vicario got no presence.  Wtf was the cross and inshallah tactic at the end. Blow a huge chunk of your budget on talented youngsters and then refuse to play them in favour of Timo Werner. Ange-Ball. Johnson is abysmal and bringing Werner on when you lot needed a goal must‚Äôve been so depressing to see.  3 away derby wins in a row, you love to see it. Embarrassing how poor you looked today given how much has been spent since Ange has come in I mean is that not just the history of spurs though¬† I swear you didn't even win a league game for a couple of months there... arteta finished 8th two seasons in a row, think he'll be alright What is at now? followed closely by flushing shite in the cross-sectioned toilet in the science museum iykyk Timber had a great game, but he barely saw Son. Son was on our left for most of the match. It was Johnson who kept losing that battle. Yeah, Timber bossed it. I'm so glad he's rebounded well from that ACL injury.  Don't want to read too much into the Jesus and Sterling performances as they were brought on late while we were very much looking to hold on to the lead. Huh? Timber was on the other side lol. How does this have 200 upvotes?! lololol Sterling made a great opportunity for himself but took an unnecessary touch instead of shooting.   Jesus‚Ä¶ I was shouting my head off at him to take it to the corner toward the end, instead he chose to cut inside and dribble straight into 5 defenders. It does but they also defend properly, it‚Äôs not like Spurs were allowed time anywhere in the final third. Any team can sit back but it‚Äôs another thing to actually stop goals going in Teams park the bus all the time, got to have plans to break it down That‚Äôs a reference I haven‚Äôt seen in a while.  No, but seriously, great reference. Manchester City legend Frank Lampard How is he underrated? He was in TOTS Yep.  So many people give the plaudits to Saliba ‚Äî and the man is phenomenal, no doubt.  But big Gabi is a rock in that defense and puts in incredible shifts all the time.  I‚Äôm so glad his head wasn‚Äôt too turned by that Saudi offer last summer. He was just positioned so well for every cross He's our most underrated player (from non arsenal fans) Remember trying to see out games with a back 5 that contained the likes of Saka, Kolasinac, Holding, Sokratis, David Luiz, Chambers etc.  We‚Äôve come a long way You have to live through your Sokratis - Mustafi era to earn the best CB partnership in the world. Having watched ACL injuries decimate sportsmen and my friends over the years, it‚Äôs truly a marvel literally total football He's got that dawg in him We learned a lesson against Villa last year, where they were inviting our press but not to beat it via passing but instead to receive & turn under pressure (a very high risk approach). They were deliberately baiting us because once they turned out, they were free and had the whole field to attack. This year we were like OK, we won't hard press but you won't generate the resulting transition attack either.  I thought that was another great strategy from Mikel. that might be true, but i think it's also forced onto teams to sit deep. You guys can cut through really really fast, like 1-2 passes and you're in behind.  Opposition has no choice but to respect that unless they want to concede like a lot of 1v1 chances during the game.  Arsenal buildup is usually 4-5 passes but we have better ability to play in small spaces. but the speed of attack is slower hard to exploit Saliba, since 1v1s are rare against him. but timber yea they should have just tried dribbling him everytime and baited the foul (they did attack him alot but he was really good containing them & blocking crosses) Why run at a player when you can pass backwards? I think Vicario tried, but it was a pitiful attempt And Rice Rice baby  Our entire starting midfield was out Prime Moyes x Dyche fusion You live in Dog River, Saskatchewan so opinion DISCARDED If you watched last season and think Arsenal are not entertaining, you should just stop watching football. Moyes didn‚Äôt win the league in September I understand your point, but I‚Äôve seen Jorginho desperately trying to get back on the break enough to know his pace is a significant weakness. Yes, he‚Äôs smart enough to minimize his exposure, but smart managers and players are also smart enough to exploit it. Spurs, it turns out, are not. But for Arsenal, he is also scoring goals. I don't remember any Chelsea fans defending him lol If he can improve his left foot delivery he's gonna be a problem. Other aspects are already pretty solid. Boys Bretheren It's Tottenham It‚Äôs tottenham Can you repeat the question? Who is that question for? I just choked on my water brilliant reference I reckon Arteta coulda ran faster than Jorginho for the last 10 minutes. He looked absolutely spent. Pretty sure partey had money on a spurs goal, or else how is he giving the ball away that much at the end? i have no idea if they have anything left for atlanta game You mean teams that adapt their playing style, tactical set-up and in-game management win? Who knew. G‚Äôday mate needs that memo. Our first choice midfield was out and you lost.  üßÇ I'm surprised because I thought Spurs were midtable quality.  On closer inspection, I predict they'll be fighting relegation by March True üòÇ yeah werner is a clown, the mustafi of forwards. Much slapstick with him. Yeah exactly. Pep's city is a perfect example. They are constantly changing tactics season on season and dominant. More wins at the Tottenham stadium since it was built than they have at Highbury/Emirates combined since the Premier league began lol I actually hate this sigh. Before this horrible spell taking an away win was literally impossible for either of us.  And this was even with a stylistically and objective worse teams that we've had.  Very gutted Have we got more NLD wins at the new Tottenham stadium than Tottenham? More than they have at our stadium in all of the PL era Chat is this real!?!  Edit: Holy shit it's actually true!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby It‚Äôs a joke pal, seriously? How‚Äôs this weird? Liverpool flair üò≠üò≠üò≠ Not how you use the word ""unanimously"" mate Lol you‚Äôre in an Arsenal thread about winning a fucking vital game against our biggest rival and you can‚Äôt tell op is clearly taking the piss enjoying the win Why are you crying you lot have been saying the same about goodison until last season. This is what a rivalry is For sure. Rice and odegaards athleticism was missed today The rest of the team outshone our two balon d‚Äôor nominees who did play today. Making a case for next year‚Äôs awards. Even as someone who adores van Dijk and Konate together it's very hard to argue against Saliba and Gabriel. thread was mad. never seen gaslighting that bad before, man. guys were calling saliba a mediocre defender over the fucking nations league while also propping up ROMERO of all people. I mean one won the World Cup and Copa America and one lost to Paraguay, and it ain‚Äôt even like he was carried to those trophies, it a lot more of a spurs issue then a Romero issue. This is even trying to be lolSpurs but I swear he's had an awful game or made a goal-conceding mistake every time we've played him? Ramsdale is a good shot stopper and was well-liked by the fans but Raya was a definite upgrade. It was a very unexpected signing and Arteta said some weird stuff. Media tried to start shit narratives, but anyone who knows Arteta knows Raya was the number 1 as soon as he was signed And 4 left backs injured Definitely once we got into it, but the first 20 mins were nervous af Bro, it wasn‚Äôt just Conte. There‚Äôs a [compilation](https://youtu.be/c6EbFahUJhE?si=TvOKTnriue7-J9Ls) of their managers doing that I mean that‚Äôs just average Conte tbf Tbf, they won 4-1 at this ground last season and Nico Jackson scored a hattrick.  They‚Äôre also sitting above you in the table rn. uhhh yes‚Ä¶ we almost always beat you lot at your stadium and never lose to you at home Everyone hates Spurs. Rice got a yellow card for a ball being rolled toward him and he lightly toe tapped it away, resulting in a red.  2 players kicked around a dead ball while a free kick was in order with zero discipline whatsoever.  Let‚Äôs just have some consistency if we‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúthe law.‚Äù Against Gabriel and saliba too smh What having Partey and Jorginho together without Odegaard in a midfield does to you I saw like 4 hate comments from you, worry about forrest buddy üòÇ Yeah one of those plans worked. It‚Äôs been on the FPL app since at the very least 2018-19. But most people I know don‚Äôt seem to be aware it‚Äôs an option.  Haaland breaks the game unfortunately, especially in a smaller league It was always on FPl, at least the last few seasons it was. I thought he looked pretty good tbh. He was unlucky with his header Spurs being a perennially harmless football club has a lot to do with it. No one's fussed what they get up to. I absolutely loved Ramsdale, but this was definitely a game where Raya really shows why he became the first choice Will have rice and hopefully calafiori back [deleted] Honestly that game would be reminiscent of the game last season at Etihad. City would be content to sit back and Arsenal might be ok to do the same. It‚Äôll be a game of chicken. At least rice will be back. What‚Äôs the word on odegaards return? That would be the perfect meme but Everton is another level of chaos I was surprised how composed he looked. Didn‚Äôt seem phased by such a big game. Our midfield was made up of two slow AF, old players, and Havertz who doesn‚Äôt have the ball control to play himself out of trouble like Odegaard does. Could‚Äôve easily seen them being overrun Partey and Jorginho? Balanced? I wouldn‚Äôt call Jorginho, Trossard, and Partey balanced I mean they‚Äôve been talking about how our team is lucky with no injuries and that we was gonna lose now that we had two important players unable to play and yet‚Ä¶ LETTER OF THE LAW Last year at St James' Park there were a whole bunch of Spurs flairs on here claiming Gabi should've been stronger.  Doesn't feel good when the shoe is on the other foot huh It was unpunished because it wasn't a foul, hope this helps Just a push will do Push off? Your guy didnt know where he is. Looking behind him whilst Gabriel was in the air scoring. Be rational You had a player stand there like his legs didn't work that allows Gabi to score, should be questioning your defence more than anything, he has ages to get back in to position ‚ÄúA push off‚Äù  Oh dear Exactly I'm biased, obviously, but I had way more confidence Conte was actually going to do something with Tottenham than Ange. I like this. Let‚Äôs keep this up. Our biggest weakness today was the crippling lack of pace from our double pivot.  Spurs needed more men in the middle and more athleticism there, ideally carriers to run circles round Partey and Jorginho.  Sarr's decision making in those areas is questionable but his mere existence would have created more problems than Maddison did.  Trying to target Timber more doesn't really make sense considering he was the best player on the pitch and let nothing by him. He is small but didnt he punch a couple of balls away in corners? I swear someone said this exact same thing to me last year when we beat them at the toilet bowl lmao We established that a two handed shove to the back of the head is not a foul last season mate keep up And here lies reddits biggest crybaby. I agree, there were some moments of danger from him that got me worried, fortunately faded in the second half Also hasn‚Äôt played much. No idea if he is as good as he seemed last year but this isn‚Äôt the game to judge him on I don‚Äôt think. If he was fully fit then sure.¬† Tactics certainly don‚Äôt help with that. Porro is so good that Guardiola signed him for City, immediately loaned him out and was happy to sell him at the first offer. A right sided Angeli√±o if you will such a bad take. Where do you get xGOT from ? 170 million on Richarlison, Solanke and Johnson Yeah üòÇ Martial has over 100 career goals in Top 5 leagues 2 games, he came back from injury this game Does ‚Äúquite well today‚Äù mean he missed all 2 of his chances and won the ball back twice? Don‚Äôt think so mate This is true, but I mean it more as a compliment to Eddie than to denigrate Solanke I said that in pre-season, that this has to be the season Martinelli gets his act together because I really fear next summer he's going to be on the chopping block should a replacement come into view. > he should have found Saka for that pass  Im not even mad that he didn‚Äôt try to pass. I‚Äôm mad because that was goddamn awful shot, and he had all the time in the world to prepare for it. It was 100% chance, even without Saka there I think my primary concern is his offensive decisions. Sometimes he‚Äôs halfway past his man but goes into a new dribble. Far too often his passes and runs are read.  He‚Äôs clearly got the potential considering the faith Arteta puts in him. Let‚Äôs just hope he finds that spark back towards the player we all hope he‚Äôll become. He was substituted on if I remember correctly. We live in the age of hyperbole.  There is such a difference between ""not top 5"" and ""Argentinian Mustafi"". Romero isn't top 20 lol Well we had zero decent fullbacks except for Lahm who was playing in midfield before the tournament started. So L√∂w experimented a bit and then settled for the option to not use fullbacks at all and just played with a back line made up of four centre backs. Until he finally put Lahm on RB. their attack had macallister alvarez messi and di maria Exactly. We should praise this effort. Put that praise in the trophy cabinet too. Nailed it Why is that wild? They‚Äôve been shit for 70% of the PL era since the stadium was built Every single week for about two years ange would play the same way and make 3 subs on 60 mins without fail, regardless of how the game was going.   But the big difference for me is that spurs don't have a kyogo type, or a mcgregor type. These two were absolutely vital to the entire set up. Not to say either are better or worse than what spurs have, but that mcgregor role was so vital in setting tempo, winning the ball back, making the smart passes, and it feels like at spurs that role is broken up into two roles. For example last season spurs playing with Yves and Sarr, they were together doing the job mcgregor did on his own.   And kyogos movement, and hanging behind the attacking players was absolutely massive in stretching the pitch and creating space for others. Ben White is a menace defensively as well. Even Kai deserves a shout. And then add when Rice is in there, and considering Merino will be in as well. It‚Äôs a hard group to get anything on set pieces. See Lampard stinking up the league during his managerial stints and no sky pundit talking about how shit he was in the media for reference. Literally won the cup in his first year I liked Ange when he first came to the league but it feels more and more like he really doesn‚Äôt get football fans. Between that recent comment, the attacks on the spurs fans when it came to that Man City game last season, and even a weird point blank refusal to ever look at set pieces, it just feels like hasn‚Äôt a clue on so many things. I agree just the creativity loss is massive I think Arteta knows a bit about football üòÇ It won‚Äôt be the end of the pain but it‚Äôs a sunny day in what‚Äôs going to be months of rain and you‚Äôve gotta appreciate the sunny days when happen and thank you for the kind words Thank you for your kind words it means a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks man, and I‚Äôll tell her all these people have her back too it will make her feel less alone when she needs it the most and right in COYG I‚Äôm sorry for your loss man, lost my mum not to look ago either so I know that pain or losing a close family member during the football season, but we winning at their ground will always make a tough time seem a little easier and if you ever wanna chat about loss or vent about stuff man give me a DM Haha, if definitely gonna try and get the middle name to be Gabi! üòò Thanks man! And we will be stronger and come through this on the otherwise stronger people and hopefully with a little one on the way too It really did, they say football is just a game but it truly does make a bad time into a good one and how can just a game do that? Thanks man that‚Äôs really lovely to hear and hopefully they‚Äôll see Arsenal as champions of at least something! Thank you for your support it means a lot We are as close as we‚Äôve ever been since it happened and I‚Äôm making her feel like the princess she is during this time because if I‚Äôm feeling awful about I can‚Äôt imagine how she must be Sticking together is what good Arsenal fans do ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks man it truly means a lot honestly you have no idea He hasn't been given a fair chance. I'd be fuming if my club made the transfers Tottenham have and still expected top 4. thanks thanks thanks If I had to choose right now, same. I still angeball can have a future though. People can say the inability to break down a deep lying defense is down to Ange but this team hasn't had any capability to do so in years. Maybe a little more time with Solanke and others will help us play through the middle a little more but this isn't anything new for anyone that's watched Spurs in the last 3 years¬† Jesus your kinda right it's like Conteball but defending on the halfway line. Footballing terrorism gone suicide bombing üòÇ His underlying numbers are really poor, actually!! He underperformed his xG by 5 goals last season and even though he got 10 assists in the PL, his xA were only mere 4.2! which means means that the players around him were really good finishers, not that Johnson is a playmaker or anything like that! It's more of a testament how good the defence to cover up the hole. It might work against this Spurs side, but I would hate to face a City with this midfield. Saliba is one of the best in the world, and Gabby regularly outperforms him. Solid! he was saying it sarcastically to spurs fan who say they have the best defenders I'd say Leverkusen is in there as well with Frimpong and Grimaldo being probably the best full backs in the world. Competition between Arsenal, Inter, Madrid I would say.   Clearly the top 3 rn I think he‚Äôs talking about Arsenal‚Äôs Yes, I‚Äôve seen way to many spurs fans saying Romero is the best cb in North London Not really VDV tbf but Romero is super overrated by people in general. Just look at the combined XI before the match lol Only on the most delusional corners of the internet Sadly yes. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è One of them just has a World Cup and two Copa Americas. No biggie, though. Van de Ven is one month younger than Saliba. Saliba and VDV are the same age. Literally a couple of weeks apart in age. Great seems a bit if a stretch. Was very uncomfortable playing from the back, lost the ball to Havertz and proceeded to just kick it away after a while. Romero might have been worse tho lol Should they also openly consider that water is wet and the sky is blue? Totnum Nah I'm not a chooser like the majority of you lot. I'll either watch spurs or quit watching football But against Leicester the narrative was that Spurs couldn‚Äôt finish. Today they created absolutely naught Yep! We had the entire starting midfield out and still didn‚Äôt really get threatened. Impressive Still won innit. Wasn‚Äôt even particularly hard Is there a history there?  Dear God, you're an FSU fan. You're having an awful fall so far. He‚Äôs not wrong though. Romero has no idea where Gabriel is and vicario is made of paper. Oh well arsenal win at the toilet bowl yet again Whereas you keeping a close eye on my posts on this sub just in case I mention Spurs or Ange Postecoglou is totally normal behaviour, right? I'm not going to apologise for thinking he's a fraud and commenting on football matches I just watched kid. Dude needs to move on to greener pastures at this stage in his career. I noticed he was doing some flicks on the wing at times, don‚Äôt recall him being that kind of player, always remember him being more direct and really dangerous at fast counters. Yeah he had plenty of the ball but did nothing with it¬† They‚Äôd be smart to shift him next summer, he‚Äôs done at this level I've been saying he's shite for years and everyone always brings up how he's good for Argentina. Mustafi was good for Germany at times too, so what  VdV looks like a player if he learns how to pass though, gives me Vermaelen vibes Romero was at fault for the goal again. He's absolutely overrated. He‚Äôs been a viability so many times, not marking the man on for the Vardy goal, last season for all of that bullshit with Chelsea, etc. Mr. Usain Bolt over here That was Stoke + Dyche‚Äôs Burnley + Mourinho‚Äôs 04/05 Chelsea. Other than the first 7 mins of the game, Arsenal did not let Spurs anywhere near Raya. Blocked shots left and right, compact, tight, aggressive. Extremely well organized from Arteta. I might just get over my Sokratis and Mustafi PTSD. No.. the White mis-pass he took too much time on, and Saliba eventually cleared. Good shout Throw-in merchant lol account suspended. That wasn‚Äôt even an issue today! Don't forget the mate on the end As far as I could tell he only made one mistake with the ball and that was delaying his pass to Havertz who drifted offside.  His next pass forward for Sterling was perfectly timed. Just a billion dollar Burnley, Arsenal. Dyche could win the league with these players Baffling why he didn't start Under Poch, then they didn't invest and then they sacked him.¬† And that's largely due to the luck of having Harry Kane who ended up being a goal scoring machine. The way spurs fans were pretending that was a courageous approach made me laugh back then. You‚Äôre right, Sam Allardyce is much more tactically flexible and charismatic than Ange British then, He was born and raised in England btw It‚Äôs a common thought amongst Arsenal fans that Gabriel is just as good as Saliba. Last season Gab was the better of the two.  Think the main differentiators are Saliba is a bit more composed on the ball under pressure, but Gab has a better long ball on him and is more dangerous from set pieces. Just good at different things You‚Äôre goddamn right!!! Better than spurs choking in September When we win 14 out 15 games? We beat them at their ground april 28th‚Ä¶ > 9 PL wins and negative goal difference in 22 games this calendar year. If he can‚Äôt manage to beat Arsenal without their two best players what hope does he have at Spurs? They‚Äôre poor defensively because their structure needs actual defenders with good IQ to play in a high line. Udogie and Porro are failed wingers, Romero is genuinely brain dead and vdv is covering across 4 lanes. They‚Äôre set up to fair both structurally and talent wise I didn't have faith and benched Gabriel. Forgot about the corners They don't act it. They are hard. Is that the one George Graham won for them? Maybe go through the league tables for the past 15 years or so and you'll see why? Spurs have probably finished outside of the top 6 as many times as Arsenal have in that period No Tomiy‚Ä¶wait he‚Äôs he‚Äôs never fit anyway I disagree. This is a massive result considering the context, but the performance was mid at best. You could have played better even with that starting XI. You did neutralize Spurs attacks efficiently, and generally look safe all game. But there are some sloppy passes and your frontline should be more clinical. Though Trossard was really impressive. Another player I forgot to mention that boosts our defence is Raya himself. The big man plucking crosses out of the air and actually catching them just makes crossing so much less effective against us.  Hopefully we don't have to experience an injury to one of the two big men Toney‚Äôs a better player but seems like a massive dickhead tbf They would have had to compete with Saudi money, non starter. Yes lmao SHIT We missed 6 players and almost our entire midfield, acting like Jorginho can do Odegaard job while being slow as fuck   Merino wasn't there aswell just like Zinchenko, Calafiori, Tomiyasu I am sure your girlfriend glazed some handsome Arsenal player or some shit, never seen someone hate at this level while not supporting any team that participated in the match. Two of our most important players who make the midfield tick. Sometimes luck is all you need no one will remember if we got lucky they will just remember the 3 points Say that again without crying Why would he fix problems he willingly creates to play a brand of football that would never win you anything in the PL? How many points have Spurs gotten since their 26/30 start? No, they‚Äôre delusional enough to think they have a chance every single time Yup. 1-0 is 1000-0 in the NLD Still hurts just as bad I reckon With a complete back up midfield and still a handful of injuries Thanks Messi! Trophy logic to compare playersüò≠ Comparing 7 games to 76 games is really fucking stupid lol International defending is totally different, teams aren‚Äôt as organized on either side of the ball so physical players who aren‚Äôt tactically elite are always going to look better than they are.   Romero‚Äôs WC still doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to what Saliba did last season though. Romero's entire NT career. He drops a perfect performance every time for Argentina. Even the other day they lost but he was crazy good. Ok so everyone should give up? I thought VvD and Konate were pretty similar in quality to Saliba and Gabi XL? I missed it. Was it worse ?? Lmao Calm down, bitch tits. Romero had no idea where Gabriel was. Romero was moving forward as gabi put his hands into him, never a foul With enough things that go against Arsenal, I can live with Gabriel doing his little pushing Cmon, let‚Äôs be adults here. He‚Äôs not good. How many times has he given the ball away in the middle of the park so easily? Sloppy performance. He had a 6.2/10 game only because he went the full 90 and miraculously didn‚Äôt injure himself.  The quicker Arsenal move on from him, the better. This isn‚Äôt 2022 anymore, he‚Äôs not all there physically or mentally. Used to be Arsenal‚Äôs most important player, now a poor performance from him and an average performance from Jorginho results in a 1-0 win away vs Spurs Had a buddy of mine who‚Äôs a spurs fan tell me it was looking like he might start this week with sarr‚Äôs injury. Is he just an idiot? WHAT DO WE THINK OF üí© Maybe they know what to do with them? I think to get anywhere fast, Spurs need a manager like Ange who actually has a philosophy and sticks to it. Sure, may not work,  but having a pragmatic coach would just lock in top 6 at best forever.  I just don't think the players Spurs have brought in are at the level, and their best player in Son has dropped down one What would you have done?   He started with two 10s as 8s, he swapped our DM for an 8, he added a winger so that Son could move into a striker role (Richy and Lankshear are injured) alongside Solanke, and spent the entire game pressing  So why big brain moves are you making? lol I really don‚Äôt think that spurs are winning a European trophy this season. Any half decent manager knows how to set up against them Gillet is just an awful ref in general so ‚Äúa poor performance‚Äù is definitely preferable to a ‚Äúgame changingly awful one‚Äù I‚Äôll take bad both ways. We can‚Äôt expect good, so just even is enough What do we think of üí©? That's half the reason I'd even play in the first place Because all they have to aim for is a ¬£60m disaster in Solanke who will be lucky to scrape 5 goals a season. Any other club in the world and the fans would be rioting in the streets with how embarrassing the leadership is. Literally don't have to look further than the front page of the sub.  https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fhcg0q/gabriel_martinelli_arsenal_chance_vs_tottenham_19/ Good physical presence but a bit suspect when it came to decision making not good tbh Mostly invisible He had like one chance but besides that he was invisible. Son was the same way Eh, Tottenham has the resources to where they should have at least a couple players who would start for Arsenal or Liverpool. E.g. they had prime Kane, Son, and Eriksen for multiple seasons.  And elite football is so complex no coach is revamping their systems on the fly midseason. This isn't FIFA. Managers get the players they think will fit their system. Ange is just whiffing. ü§£ I hear you. Just thought that the gap was so big in terms of mentality and organization that Arsenal still should have been favourites. Small argument to say 3 with Merino, but understand that he was a new buy. That being said. Having your entire midfield out is wild. Yeah the 2 people that run the whole game. In their place, we played two old midfielders with 0 recovery pace. Mate I watched the match with three mates and literally all of us were yelling out for Arteta to make subs lol he's a great manager but having fresh legs earlier would've helped Do you know how to read? I literally called him amazing lmao Because Trossard was clearly tired and kept losing possession. I mean it all worked out in the end but I would have liked to see the subs earlier because as mentioned we could have punished them and maybe got a second. But hey, we got the 3pts so who cares. You got me wrong I think. This is a complement to Arteta and the Arsenal team. Great solid defensive display. Not everyone can spend like Chelsea It‚Äôs not a question about spending, it‚Äôs about the talent. They‚Äôve spent poorly. To be fair, Arsenal needed less signings by that point, just a few key pieces Damn, you have no reason to be desperate enough to pick on a teenager who was already a top Championship player at 17, all because he didn‚Äôt play in one match. Give the lad some time! I didn‚Äôt read that part lol  ‚ÄúAgainst all the odds‚Äù, Spurs weren‚Äôt even clear favourites, for anyone who knows both teams well they‚Äôd think this game has pretty even odds, even with our injuries and at their stadium Insane. People exaggerate to astronomical proportions for karma. Was this the best chance for spurs to win in awhile? Yes. Did we think the title was over going into this game? Lmao i wish it were bait man. i along with most arsenal fans believed the title race was surely over after odegaard went down injured, but they keep doing the impossible [deleted] Lol¬† But they did quite well. Sure our defense was better and their finishing was very low but apart from that they had good off ball movement, decent tactics. It was a good game to watch. Yeah I think they will struggle to live up to the spud's 'new dawn' of last season¬† Sorry they looked better than Arsenal lol That‚Äôs pretty much what I mean, I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôre so angry lol Hard to escape a rape caught on audio but didn‚Äôt seem to injure his career much Yeah nah this ain't it fam [deleted] Greenwood wasn‚Äôt convicted and yet our entire fanbase protested the news that we were going to reintegrate him and forced the club to renege. that's not how it works Please don't defend Partey. With love, a fellow Gunner You‚Äôre kind of fucked in the head a bit aren‚Äôt ye? What if language wasn't a stagnant thing but keeps evolving?  Edit: Flammable vs inflammable There's not a faster player in the league as far as I know. Goal scored and there should‚Äôve been a look. it‚Äôs clearly two hands in the back to find space for the header, ‚Äòweak‚Äô or not it was a pivotal moment Ok that's embarrassing, thought both those situations were sterling lmao. Yeah, my bad lmao, thought both those situations were him Allow 31 crosses in the Champions League or against Liverpool and City and come find me again Solanke had a very good chance first half just took way too long. I dont think Arsenal had any chances really, just awful defending from one corner. Let them have that. I hope they continue to play like this for the whole season. Crosses till death do us apart. My point being a better or equal team to Spurs capitalizes on at least 1 cross on a different day It was just one of those games where you'd feel like if they played 500 minutes, there still wouldn't be a goal from open play What else can they complain about? Lol it‚Äôs all they got. Winning against 11 men in the box is hard. Not many teams can. We weren‚Äôt full strength either lol. And you created two chances all game. I‚Äôve seen FSU win multiple championships. I‚Äôll be ok. You think I posted that for upvotes?  I‚Äôve been around long enough to know the mouth breathing group think from Arsenal fans trumps any rational thought in this sub.   And I don‚Äôt know what tottenhamnole is. Merino has never started for you. Or NFO Exactly. Add rice in for Jorginho and there‚Äôs more speed and Partey can take more chances with the ball. They only lost to Forest because Forest would run circles around City. That‚Äôs what we tried last season and we were quite unlucky to have missed a couple of sitters, it almost worked You're allowed to swear on the internet kid To be fair, they are evolving away from the terror ball.   Yes we were boring today but we have no midfield. Of course we are going to defend. someone who hasn't watched Atleti since the 2016 champions league We may not play the most entertaining football but its definitely more entertaining than this Awful. Not a chance in sight. Day was a disaster.¬†  Arse are still bigger cunts though.¬† Not before it was played, but he got pushed so much before the shot he could made his bed in there and react to Gabriel heading the ball after, he just turned around and watched it. I must admit you're quite good defensively but you were not playing against a real team.  A Manager that relies on a CB upfront to get a lead is just a crap Manager. Zero ideas. Fair enough. [deleted] City is not invincible. Porto beat them last year which shows you that you just need to apply some tactical approach you don¬¥t need this kung-fu football Tottenham is playing without being sharp with your inbetween passes or on the counter or in front of goal you need to be sharp but not brain-less kung-fu all out approach. The amount of Energy and intensity Tottenham is playing with is fuking admirable tho but with little brain cells they could have trashed Arsenal 4-0 Still got top players against a terrible Tottenham. An entertaining game would be nice Not to be too kind to a Tottenham fan but in truth we were like this for YEARS, and still are in some cases, but legit it‚Äôs the worst feeling in the world. Just so unfair to see a team dominate and have so many opportunities just to lose 1-0 to a goofy ass goal or penalty they randomly got.   I can relate, must be absolutely frustrating for you to see today as happy as I am lol In the Prem definitely. In the world maybe not. Inter are like the Black Gate of Mordor. Nothing gets in  Edit: I should clarify. I think Inter and Madrid are strong shouts for the toughest defenses in the world atm. üèÖ Might be right You only conceded 5 less than City. Despite playing way more defensively. Against City away you parked the bus. Against Spurs away you conceded possession and hit them on transition.  That stat (fewest goals conceded) isn't proof that your back4 is the best when you have games where you defend with 7+ men lol  edit: that claim by Shearer isn't aggregious at all. But ""we conceded the fewest goals!"" is such a stupid argument with all context removed  edit: oh no! Angry arsenal fans downvoting me bc I don't suck off their back4. Guess that's proof that it indeed is the best back4. The back4 gets better with every downvote, I'm sure. Maybe Gabriel will even stop having bozo moments if this comment gets enough downvotes. Who knows They don‚Äôt, they haver a better attack Liverpool fan either gonna use Van Dijk to say they do, or slobber over City‚Äôs dick and say them üòÇ Cheating club still playing a rapist. How impressive you clowns Still playing a rapist. Imagine supporting that team. It was a push you dumbass Cheats ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§° Cheating fucks. No one with a brain is a gooner They went too crazy on potential‚Ä¶ it happens Brennan ‚ÄúNo‚Äù Johnson It's essentially Kanes replacement after Richarlison hasn't been able to keep fit and deliver. It's fine to mention other bits of bad business, just because I think they vastly overpaid for Solanke doesn't mean I think their other recent business has been anything special. Can never have enough Haribo gold bears Directly related to the absolutely maddening prices set by Levy & co I feel like I heard more boos for Saka than for Partey, which is surprising to say the least.  Like, far be it from me to tell a fanbase who to dislike more, but I never would've guessed allegedly diving too much would piss people off more than rape. Which is wild because it‚Äôs pretty widely known how shit he is when you boo him Hype men on every corner. The irony in this post... Same! Although I somehow  was noticing the same for American football too which made me think it was something wrong with me This game it felt unnaturally quiet though, like it was super suppressed. I prefer to hear yerda yelling obscenities if that's what they're trying to mute They did mix things up, they literally tried intricate play at a point of not even shooting trying too many passes  Did u even watch? Yes they did, the Madison pass to Solanke who didn't shoot where they could have shot like 3 times, Solanke taking his time as well with too many touches, Kulu had a good chance after a  very good intricate play down the left Sounds like a scam I was surprised too, I thought he was from their academy Yep pretty much, except we played so many CAMs that we could actually pass through defenses if given the chance. Even one of our best DMs under during Late Stage Arseneball was a former CAM lmao¬†   Spurs basically just wait for Madders to do something otherwise they send it to their wingers to cross it in. At least Wenger always comes up different ways to get destroyed in big games Not really sure you can call that clear cut. The only angle he had was right at the keeper. My biggest thing was him staying strong and riding through challenges I think he came to early to us, would have needed more time with mid table clubs before coming into a cl/pl title pushing team.¬† I understand. But for me it wasn‚Äôt that surprising. We were playing a low block that was extremely effective and didn‚Äôt require anyone to be subbed out. Putting Kiwior in wouldn‚Äôt really help (it might actually hurt).   Meanwhile putting attackers in helped.   Also it wasn‚Äôt surprising to me because we didn‚Äôt really have anyone defensive or in midfield we could put in that would really help. Like taking Ode off to put in Partey. He was just hanging out a few yards offside for no apparent reason. Love to see it. I think Raya had it covered So lazy. Just came on and walking back onside . Timo man Wtf actually happened. Was decent for you guys It isn't that hard to believe that happened. Maddisson has probably been our best player so far this season Calafiori is presumably the long term starter, no? Rice at the CDM Don't think anyone's starting over Timber for any reason any time soon. Yeah, much like Bissouma Jorginho? Getting downvoted for calling a rapist a rapist üëç You joke but the Arsenal press runs through him Out of possession Odegaard leads our press. He is very important to the team when we don't have the ball Reminds me of when de Gea first joined Utd. Looks tiny in between the sticks. No presence to him at all. So much of goalkeeping is having confidence and players knowing they can get at Vicario on set pieces will just make him even more uncertain. Literally made of paper, Gabriel header goes right through jim Pretty funny how he plays big man when Timber ‚Äúfouls‚Äù Porro but when he actually has to be physical he is nowhere to be seen. Somehow even worse than ramsdale at set pieces Kind of explains loads about Tottenham's problems really.  Could fix them, but would rather focus on other, smaller problems that aren't actually that important. Maddison has been shocking for some time though, somehow avoided a lot of criticism. It's because he always gasses out early in games, poor stamina Deserved to be taken off for that god awful trim That‚Äôs when I knew ange was calling it a day. Why on earth remove him Let‚Äôs cross into David Raya who catches everything and Arsenal‚Äôs two centre backs who are two big skyscrapers Trying to cross the ball endlessly against this Arsenal defence should be a sackable offence. Ange Postenoclue. > Johnson has been shit since moving to Spurs  for a ¬£50m transfer i feel like he got a pass by a lot of people  that‚Äôs double double the cost of sancho, who‚Äôs only one year older than him > Vicario got no presence.  Obviously set pieces are a problem, but you won't find a single Spurs fan that thinks Vicario is the problem or even close to it. We can't make any decent chances despite hoarding the ball all game Spurs fans were calling Vicario the best keeper in the league last season He also won an FA cup though. Ange isn't Arsenal manager though. Likewise, he hasn't won a trophy and the team aren't getting better. You lot are outspending us and moving backwards. You're in for a rude awakening when you realise ange isn't anywhere near as good as arteta, he'll be given the sack, mediocre club will just continue to see mediocrity despite their fans false hope Not many managers in football have been as backed as Artetas been, hardly the standard. Had far more issues than spurs did atm with a far worse team. https://www.11v11.com/teams/chelsea/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Tottenham%20Hotspur/ I was more mad at those two for dribbling the ball to the middle of the final third rather than to the corner to try and snag one more set piece and maybe a second goal while eating up the clock.  Otherwise, it was hard to rate their contributions in that game state. I want a bullet at the back post or to the corner. Can‚Äôt turn that over Raz Best defensive team in the league last year knows how to play defense. We did. They just didn‚Äôt work. What‚Äôs the reference What‚Äôs the reference? *NYCFC Every single place I seen, VVD was ahead of him Most Spurs fans had Romero or VDV ahead of him in their combined XIs for one Why would I try to remember that?! Blatant disrespect to our record signing mustafi heh..   I still remember that guy s constant goof-ups  followed by him raising his hand to ask for offside.. I'm wondering if these advanced treatments are available for normal peeps like us Yep, another example of a more pragmatic approach. Just adding that slight bit of conservatism at the right moments works wonders. In the end, we‚Äôve got the quality to where we don‚Äôt need to gamble. üòù Rival fans will tell you all our starting 11 were fit though, because they started, that makes them starters. How could I forget!! Buzzing. Take the win and we go again midweek David dyche on the menu lol Speak to Chelsea fans and I‚Äôll dare say over half of us still appreciates what he did for our club. There were definitely many fans defending Kai, myself included. What‚Äôs his actual natural position ? Mates But does give it a run for the money Same amount I think. 3 wins each Clown deleted his comment headloss confirmed. Must have been rattled by forest at home and us now winning For me   Kai, Timber, big gabi and saliba were immense Even if you don't think Arsenal's pair are the best, Liverpool and City clearly have better CBs than Spurs. Some players get such reactive opinions on them while others have a national team to get world class shouts Never thought id' need to point that out football is a team sport. Joselu has more club trophies than Harry Kane bu comparing their individual careers based on that would make no sense [deleted] Off the top of my head: -Lost Gabriel today -Might have been marking havertz the previous match when he scored -Own goal and conceded a penalty in the 2-2 last season I'm on a high but yeah I think for about 10mins of the 1st half we were just giving the ball to them, but our defense is that damn good. Funniest game I've seen in a while. thanks for reminding me. Gonna look up the highlights now. Lmao against 9 men and also missed numerous sitters? State of your club that you‚Äôre bragging about a win from a year ago against nine men. Have fun having Nicholas Jackson until 2033 The same game Rice got that second yellow, an opposing player had done much worse in the first half without being cautioned. Consistency between games are important, but when inconsistency happens within a game, it‚Äôs even more egregious. I‚Äôd be livid had that happened to my team. Happened just before Saliba got a yellow card for delaying a restart also.  Even this game didn‚Äôt have consistency with this nonsense. That‚Äôs how you play a lot of games lmao you‚Äôre set piece park the bus FC Haha yeah I can imagine whoever gets Haaland dominates everyone else. Is it a snake draft where whoever gets the last pick in the first round then gets the first pick in the second round? That way the lucky team who got Haaland has to build the rest of their team with less desirable players. He's been *unlucky* with an awful lot of opportunities in the last couple of games though. Lads, it's Tottenham. Yeah literally even as a fan I get bored lol Feel like City could be a bit more adventurous knowing we are a bit broken in midfield Very quiet, probably intentionally so to keep opponents guessing.  But the thought was ‚Äúat least three weeks‚Äù We have no idea. Arteta is keeping things close to his chest. Reportedly was in training but that could be mind games I'd be surprised if he's back for City, but wouldn't absolutely rule out him being on the bench Havertz has stellar ball control; he just doesn't do anything interesting with it.  Odegaard is much more willing to take risks, and of course is more agile due to the difference in build. Vs the midfield spurs played? Yes. Not saying it was amazing but it's more balanced than Bentancur, Kulusevski and Madison The pundits are all such pathetic gutless liars Was it really a weakness though if there was almost never an opportunity to exploit it? There was almost never an opportunity to actually counter and have your midfield trying to make up ground and defend, plus even though you had Rice out who does provide a bit of screening usually, you've still got good midfielders in Jorginho and Partey ahead of the best defense in the league. To me it seemed clear that you were set up to not allow those weaknesses to happen and it just worked. Don't think Sarr for the whole game changes that. He definitely did, but it didn't look convincing to me. Obviously I don't watch Vicario week in week out, and I dread being carried away by a narrative, but what I saw from him today tracks with what people on here are saying. Might be obvious to say, but I think the crucial difference between the two games was Odegaard. The tactics were similar - it wasn't that Arsenal were being defensive, but that Spurs' mindless attack was being managed. Arsenal knew no matter how much possession Spurs had, they were always a sick pass or great bit of footwork away from being in on goal.  Today without Odegaard, there was less management and more reliance on being solid at the back - they had much less control and we saw a lot more misplaced passes as a result. Luckily, Tottenham didn't bother playing any forwards so it worked out. I am not a member of AFTV so that‚Äôs a false statement if I ever read one What exactly is he good at to the point where Romero is constantly covering him and leaving massive spaces for opponents to play into? Spurs have 44 points from 32 games with Porro. Ben white is 10x the player and had only 2 G/A less than Porro last year Hes definitely more of a winger than a fullback to be fair. xGRRMartin Your local dealer Under the bushes, next to the porn Sofascore app effectively gives you xGOT via their ‚Äúgoals prevented‚Äù figure, which are identical to the figures this dude gave. Absolute war crime 63 goals in 209 PL appearances. Piss poor for a striker. He made Saliba and Gabriel uncomfortable. Strikers rarely do. Absolutely! I think Eddie is an extremely good professional and player. Unfortunately, the team outgrew him, I‚Äôm super excited to see what he does at Palace. He's clearly lacking confidence. Was scared of missing so took a shot that was too safe. I wouldn't call that an awful shot, he tried to curl it in the corner. Would be awful if it was straight at the keeper or missed the target.. He should have just went for power there instead of trying to place, even if it gets saved Bukayo is right there for a tap in You‚Äôre right. Just double checked and he got subbed on at half time. So there you go, his last good game I remember wasn‚Äôt even a full game. üòï People just vastly overrate players because they‚Äôve (1) become beholden to viewing that player from a club favoritism perspective or (2) never seriously played the sport. Which stadium? The league was created in 92. 2 wins in 22 years. Okay, cool, thank you. I actually quite like Ange, at least as far as Arsenal fans go, but it feels like he's just making a rod for his own back. I can easily see him gone by Christmas if this keeps up. I think Gallagher would‚Äôve been very good at the McGregor role honestly. He‚Äôs a serious workhouse who‚Äôs best attribute his is ability to breakup play by just out working his opponents. People also underrated how good Raya is under a cross. I wouldn't say he's a world class keeper but he is world class at collecting crosses. There was a stat from last season floating around that he had the best catch% from crosses in Europe and by some distance.   If Gabriel or Saliba don't get it, Raya will. *6 months And 2 community shields Appreciate the support, and same goes to you! So sorry to hear about your mom but here for you if you ever need to vent That would be something else innit? :) 3 years!? Try like 10 Angeball in the two deeper thirds is looking better than last season. Conceding a set piece goal to Saka and Gabriel is something that can happen in tight games. It‚Äôs why Dyche played that way with Burnley.  If every team is going to play like Dyche Burnley against us, you can see where our signings (other than Brennan) are starting to make sense. Bergvall will grow into one of the best take-on CMs in the world. It‚Äôs easy to see Ahh, misunderstood. I think van de Ven is high quality but to say Spurs are a top 3-4 defense is just absurd. Ange's play style doesn't suit them either but they're level below Arsenal and City. Neither are defenders, though. Apples and oranges. Is that the same Frimpong who was at Arsenal? Or is that a different player? Well we dont play a back four lol     Arsenal are currently better than madrid because they have more depth and because their cbs are more consistent. Im pointing fingers at militao who's performance is a big question mark every game ~~Nah, that was a sarcastic comment on Spurs and their fans.~~  Edit: I was wrong. The rare sincere comment in this sub. I've lost count of how many times Romero has been directly at fault for spray conceding a goal Mustafi won the World Cup ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Found one ‚ò†Ô∏è Mustafi won a world cup and was also shit too, it happens. Lmao Julian Alvarez better than Haaland confirmed Good Job ! Still ain't on their level Saloba is not the norm in the slightest. I think VDV performs at a good standard personally I mean arsenals defense tactics help a hell of a lot more then ours help us. Saliba is better but it just looks so much worse when we play such a high line VdV gonna be in a wheelchair before he hits 30. Saliba is not the norm to be playing at this level at his age consistently. What do we think of totnum? lol. You better quit then. Your team is ridiculously funny. Butt of all jokes. Easy targets. Romero gets shoved in the back by Gabriel lol. The fuck are you even talking about. You are always in our threads and I notice you because it‚Äôs so very strange that a Juventus fan is so obsessed with us. Honestly, he'd be smart to go to Saudi. Time to hawk him to Madrid for 80m? Ohh Yh that one Kane would defo have scored. He‚Äôs probably scored more than a few of those type of goals against just us alone. Maddison is the most overrated 10 I have ever seen. He is terrible against any team in the top half of the league. I know but I am being pedantic. Agree it is a large amount of money for 2 players who both only had 1 really good season each. Hey now they made it to November last season before collapsing Sorry I thought Arsenal was a big club that could do that or something. I thought the expectation was doing what it takes to win the title. Did ya win the title? Even when you had been leading for weeks? Who do you want to replace him? What do you want with your squad? Ok I get you just get fucked but no need to get snarky at me. There‚Äôs not a lot of defenders who would look good playing like they‚Äôre setup to but I get your point and I agree with it I was wondering what the most cringeworthy answer to my comment could be, and I guess you found it And? They won nothing in those 15 years. They clearly are not in the same caliber as the other 5 both historically and in the modern era. It‚Äôs the neutralising opponents and looking safe all game with *that* midfield that‚Äôs impressive. Trossard isn‚Äôt a CM. He just isn‚Äôt, he can‚Äôt be the first to receive, he can‚Äôt lead the press - he impressed me too, but there‚Äôs key competences to play how we usually do that he just lacks. Jorginho barely has a press in him. Missing two of Rice, Odegaard & Merino? Okay let‚Äôs go. Missing all three? If you can set up to defend, look safe and go home with three points? Happy days. Those throws of his, directly into the feet of a running attacker ü§§ Someone has to bring delusional fans back down to earth, it‚Äôs not hating to curb exaggeration I'm convinced. Sack him, bring back a serial winner like Jose or Conte. They had the answers.¬† It certainly does not hurt as much as a 0-4 loss. Calling romero shit based on one game is pretty stupid too‚Ä¶   Let‚Äôs not forget the man won the WC and 2 copa americas recently while gabriel and saliba have been winning headers üòÅ  I‚Äôm a chelsea fan and i hate spurs as much as easily triggered arsenal fans but let‚Äôs be honest romero is not a bad defender lol Same Can be said about the great system arsenal has.. it‚Äôs not always individual brilliance.. saliba and gabriel can very well shit their pants in a different epl club Never, no fan should give up on their team. Although suppprting Spurs for 30+years I nearly have on several occasions! No that doesn't fit the current agenda. New record 14 individuals given yellow cards * he‚Äôs not as good as he once was. he‚Äôs alright but the weaknesses just show alot more, especially when paired w jorginho. the performance wasn‚Äôt that bad considering he didn‚Äôt commit any fouls or get left in the dust. personally I didn‚Äôt think him or jorginho would make it 90 minutes today. i‚Äôm saying i have to give partey a little bit of credit cause it was a tough game Tot'num TOTTENHAM I'm not saying that they need to sack him and re-hire Mourinho, I just think he needs to be a bit more flexible and open to compromise on a few things. Set pieces are still such a glaring hole for them, and their substitutions are often underwhelming when I watch them.   Long may it continue, I say, but it's starting to feel more and more untenable. Put more men in the central areas of the pitch. Our midfield was Trossard, Partey, Jorginho. That should be getting physically bullied, cut through, beaten on the counter.   Try to play the ball to Solanke's feet and do some combination play instead of endless crosses to nobody.   Have your players take on defenders. Saliba and Timber played most of the game on yellows. Literally they‚Äôre the favs to win Europa League Belongs in the üöΩ 1 low xG shot which took an even lower percentage set up in 90 mins     Our defence was rock solid today¬† You have 6 midfielders listed on your site, you lost 3 of them and 2 of them are starters  It's a fairly normal occurrence for most teams With the bench we have I think he was waiting to see who the first spurs subs were before making a change. Not really Yeah I agree but the comment I responded to was suggesting that they haven't spent much We did buy two of our most expensive signings ever after he joined though, no?  Or did he join after we got Rice and Havertz? I‚Äôm not.  I‚Äôm making a point against what someone else said that Spurs didn‚Äôt spend enough. Are these ‚ÄúMost Arsenal fans‚Äù in the room with us? I wasn't even referring to his time at Celtic. What's with the hostility lmao. The problems is the lack of players who beat their man. Kulu was actually doing okay at that but Brennan and Son really aren‚Äôt the dribblers needed against this sort of low block. In this sort of match, I‚Äôd almost rather have Odobert wide left than Son just for the dribbling¬†  Bergvall is an exceptional dribbler and having him next to Kulu will help a ton once he‚Äôs ready.¬† Mate. Not only did they *not* look better, their best 11 and depth players didn‚Äôt manage to look better than Arsenal missing their entire starting midfield with literally 2 bedded in senior players on the bench. People are impatient. This system is very compatible with Bergvall, Gray, Odobert, and Lankshear. The problem is we‚Äôre a project and people are pissed that we aren‚Äôt the finished product It doesnt appear as if any of the allegations stuck to him. Mason went to thearpy ans has audio out on his assault.   Partey was acussed by a woman and there were investigations.  Its all clear im assuming since it was 2 summers ago. The moment I lost all respect for ETH. Thing with Greenwood, all the evidence was put into he public domain.  So it was a bad look when the charges were dropped. Really, every time Fabrizio posts about him, your fans keep crying that we lost a big talent. https://x.com/Naturinda96/status/1824885402970264034?t=hkceTiSKzMzkNLctC6bHxQ&s=19 Agreed. But im leaning towards his innoscence give its been 2 years without any conviction I just called him a rapist when there‚Äôs no conclusive evidence‚Ä¶ We're was your energy for CR? I'm not sure incorrect =evolution. I genuinely think you‚Äôre right but I figured I was forgetting someone obvious I made the same mistake tbf. Thought it was Sterling who made a stupid run and I saw the number on the back of the shirt I had to remind myself Jesus plays with number 9, I get the confusion Most teams that want to put in 31 crosses are probably not aiming most of them at a lone player in the box, and missing 23 of them. Havertz had two better chances than Solanke.  The xG shows this. Havertz header was cleared off the line? Martinelli had a 1v1? I think why you're being disagreed with is that what Spurs did was likely the gameplan of Arsenal. Timbers positioning stopped cutbacks and only allowed blind crossing, and Arsenal's personnel are incredibly suited to that. With Rice and Odegaard out, we would be comparatively softer through the middle, and so forcing Spurs, who aren't a great crossing team, into those spaces and away from central areas was the plan.  Against a better team, or if arsenal were fully fit, then the gameplan would've been different, likely focusing play into the meat grinder of timber, gabriel, saliba, and rice.  Tldr; against a better team, arsenal likely play a different approach But then you‚Äôd change the tactic to fit the team Yes if a team more suited to crossing play were allowed this many crosses they might have scored. It's almost like Arsenal knew this and got Spurs to play to their own weaknesses. We hold such a good shape when teams have the ball outside the box. Can‚Äôt praise Saliba and Gabriel enough Im sure Arsenal will be weeping about the 3 points while you sulk and cope on the internet.  Also, Arsenal and City do beat 11 in the box all the time. You... might be in for a short Europa campaign ""Even if they were full strength I feel like our squad depth is at least on par with theirs, if not slightly better.""  Sound familiar? Who were you missing? Richarlison? Only needed one though. Tbh partey was pretty bad today. Gave the ball away atleast 4 times. One of those was in our box. Thank fuck for Gabi and saliba. Partey was a liability today.  I am looking forward to see what merino adds to the team honestly. Rice and merino is the only thing giving me hope Less is more, *cunt* Fair - carry on with the shithousery; I respect it. mry core Huh I don't get it are you talking about Gabriel smashing that head onto Vicario after bullying Romero ? Merino is definitely the starting midfielder over Partey, he's been awful in every game so far. Merino will start over him. But my point is you said it only takes brain cells to beat Arsenal. City are the most tactically strong, best coached team with the most lethal striker in the world, and they couldn‚Äôt beat Arsenal in the three games they played last season. And Atalanta are a considerably weaker side than City.  I completely agree with you about Spurs playing like headless chickens though. And had they had more sense, they would‚Äôve won. They absolutely should‚Äôve won playing at home against a team missing its entire midfield. Couldn't give a fuck how exciting it is, you don't get points for style Stick to your league lad. I don‚Äôt know, watching Ange get found out in a decent league was pretty entertaining Do yourself a favor and stick to the Scotch league. Stick to rscottishfootball before addressing us mate. Talking about entertainment when your marquee signing is Adam Idah, your priorities are all wrong. I‚Äôll take three points away at our local rivals over going down in style for no reason Doesn‚Äôt quite compare to the Sunday league levels of entertainment you get in the SPL does it mate Understandable. And you can have an argument against Arsenal in the Prem too if you'd like its okay. But its not ""criminal"" to shout them out as the best defense its a very reasonable take. > You only conceded 5 less than City.  ....So literally the least in the league. Cheers Geoff, you made their point again for them. We don‚Äôt play way more defensively, the only game we parked the bus last season for majority of the game that I can think of was Spurs away and Man City away. In general we‚Äôre also very possession dominating  Also City only scored 4 more goals than us, yet I doubt most here would entertain the idea of Arsenal having a better attack City parked the bus at the Emirates too And now their Android just been upgraded!!  Fuck he goal machine... Both are correct though lmao Keep going I‚Äôm almost there Hysterical¬† [deleted] Arsenal kind of the same with high priced tickets. New stadiums are expensive Wait what? Don‚Äôt you guys have a pretty solid financial model? Why on earth are the fucking with ticket prices? In the end they're going to save their energy to put Saka off his game as Partey actually doesn't need the boos to make him play like shit. Less people in the ground probably know about Partey's crimes Trumpets on the roof again So out of 90 minutes of football you can point to a handful of moves against a side with two of their starting midfield missing?   Sounds like they really are just shite at this intricate passing as well.  As soon as they went behind they had nothing but pumping the ball in to nobody. They tried, but never got anywhere. The few times they managed intricate passes that got them to the top of the 18 they looked completely lost as to what to do next. 419 Nottingham prince > Even one of our best DMs under during Late Stage Arseneball was a former CAM lmao¬†  Arteta isn't it? His first two seasons were really good. I don't think we ever committed our fullbacks into attack as aggressively though - we had a rock in Sagna, then Monreal. Clear cut =/= high percentage, does it? He did fine last season when he was needed. As far as backup goes there aren‚Äôt many better out there I would say, specially when you look at how much he cost comparing to City‚Äôs CB for instance Does he know the offside rule? Or is he just constantly bemused every time he gets called offside and never understands why? lol seriously, the most innocuous bar story I‚Äôve ever heard is foreign and complete fantasy to redditors They‚Äôre bitter. Not really saying much when ye have 4 points from 4 games We don‚Äôt really know. Timber was a very expensive signing too, he has just been injured.   Reality is though we play so many games that it doesn‚Äôt really matter Not this year, but also depends where Timber ends up. Been talk of Timber playing RB for double invert or seeing how he does at 6.  Tbh Arteta plays a lot of different styles at the back depending in the opponent. Not sure where Cala fits in tbh, Timber from the little we‚Äôve seen of him has been absolutely fantastic. If you asked me before this game I‚Äôd say yes but that timber performance‚Ä¶ wowzers Partey is arguably the starting CDM until we know what the plans are for Merino. for making jokes about it, if it‚Äôs a serious an issue as you‚Äôre making it out to be (which it is) then tribalism isn‚Äôt the way to go about it Aye but De Gea was only 20 when he joined us. Vicarios 27 so it‚Äôs hardly something I can imagine he‚Äôll grow out of. Or Almunia with Arsenal, absolutely flappy Poor jim Got the worst hairstyle imaginable to distract people from his crap form Had Tottenham fans last season questioning why we signed Havertz over Maddison, like Maddision doesn't habitually turn up for like 5 games and then get injured and then utterly disappear when he returns. Idk I think they should keep that strategy for the reverse fixture this season. Crossing into those boys is just.... It's so comfortable watching it if you're an Arsenal fan, there's so little risk of anything going wrong. i'd blame that on the club leadership more than ange, they're the ones signing players who were fighting relegation for a reason hope you grow and change as a person Hahahaha your sports life fucking sucks. 31 crosses that lead to nothing doesn't count as a plan. Could be wrong but OP said ""On a more serious note"" so its probably a reference to Lampard who had a habit of [cracking a joke and then suddenly becoming serious mid-sentence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLMd1Z9kvcQ) If your pocket is deep enough for it, any ‚Äúnormal peeps‚Äù can have the access. Where I am, it costs upwards of 100k, excluding maintenance physio and care post surgery. No   Tore both mine and played D1 here and usl   We are way behind He played mostly CB/RB for Ajax if I'm correct CB but he's looked super comfortable at LB and RB When he played back home he played across the entire backline and even some games in midfield. Mostly RB though. Hombres Lol they‚Äôre the same people complaining how we‚Äôre the most toxic and whatnot Vvd and saliba are the cleanest defenders in the league. Vvd is Slow but unbeatable once he gets in the duel, konate is the level of vdv. Both good but not highest level. Romero is the opposite of vvd everywhere but dirty as hell. Romero + vvd could be a good pairing. Romero is a worse defender, he just compensates his technical ability with agression.¬† The funny thing is there's a few players that you'd think to highlight as key to Argentina's success before Romero, including the best player of all time...and Alvarez is arguably one of them, so even in that context, the argument doesn't make sense 9 man high line will live long in my memory Just google Chelsea vs Tottenham head to head‚Ä¶ we love playing Tottenham  yeah we‚Äôre currently shit for Chelsea‚Äôs standards and yet somehow you lot still lose to a pretty dire Chelsea side. What‚Äôs the state of your club then? For all the shit Chelsea have been taking this year, you acting like Spurs are comfortably above them and Chelsea can't talk shit about them is absolutely hilarious. We are lol. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a fan out there making a list of how often this happens/will continue to happen in the next season. But at the end of the day, even if you take away all the trolling from other fans, everyone should be angry at that call because when it happens to your team it‚Äôs indefensible when it‚Äôs rarely going to happen again. lol incredibly delusional to say that we‚Äôre park the bus FC That‚Äôs how it works yeah. In a bigger league it‚Äôs more balanced that way because whoever gets Haaland in theory gets no other elite player, you probably want at least 8 players Both Partey and Jorginho are washed physically. Even in this game they lost the ball so many times that ended up creating dangerous chances for them Nah Not sure what game you were watching mate.  There were a handful of times when we pressed high and you guys played through us. Jorginho and Partey got caught high up the pitch and Jorginho even picked up a yellow for desperately bringing down Maddison. Sarr would have been great as a ball carrier (like Morgan at Villa) who could drive through central space with the ball. Even his shots from outside the box could have been a bit more problematic had he been brought on sooner.  Ultimately, the issue is that you guys constantly slowed down your own attacks especially once we funneled you out into the wide areas. Conte or Mourinho would have certainly taken advantage of some of those transition opportunities but Angeball seems to be more about first pushing teams back onto their defensive third first before breaking them down. That lack of urgency cost you three points. Surprised you could find your keyboard through the tears Just because Ange doesn't know how to use him doesn't mean he is nowhere near bad, people who have followed him for a long time know what I'm refering too, or haven't you noticed that Tottenham does 0 effort to underlay or overlap the fullbacks when they are clearly making the correct movement and have the pace to do so, Porro os also the best crosser in the team and he does it even though spurs don't put him in the correct spots to do so. Also Porto is one of the most dangerous FBs when they allow him to cut inside and the winger drags a defender with him. Both Porro and Udogie are playing like glorified wide centre backs with the way Ange plays it's criminal. Porr performanc tbh, from an XGRRM of 7.0 he only managed to  produce 5 books Not asking for your missus , mate Better numbers than Solanke lol ‚Ä¶ Gabriel won MOTM‚Ä¶ saliba yellow was for delay of restart‚Ä¶   Solanke was poor today Agree Even a broken clock is right twice a day, my friend, I just remember screaming at my TV in pure ecstasy.  Don't give up on the lad, additionally I think Raheem is gonna be great competition for him. He still has world-class potential, and his decision-making needs some work, but i think he needs to sit down with and be reassured of his place here, I feel like the pressure of needing to be the guy on the left is getting to him Always remember the golden rule about football, most people are not watching the matches. Take everything said with a grain of salt unless they actually support the team. In which they'll still overrate players, but it's better than someone who uses FIFA/FM to judge how good someone is. He's a great defender.  He times challenges well and is strong in the air.  He's just really aggressive and a penalty risk.  I don't know if he's top 5 in the PL, but comfortably top 10. He's a monster with Argentina too. ‚Ä¶ emirates stadium? Built in 2006?  Also bless you for saying 92 is 22 years ago He was always a but feisty with the Scottish press, but it always seemed (generally) a little more lighthearted, as he didn't really get tough questions.   Tbh when they signed maddison, based on the signings and personality types at celtic (and again, I'm literally only judging him on a 2 year spell in Scotland), maddison didn't seem like his kind of player at all. I do like gallagher, but I think mcgregor has a bit more cuteness and football intelligence than what he has. I think ange would have played gallagher in that mooy role, those late runs on either side of the box. A world's difference from Ramdsale. I loved the bloke but there was always an underlying nervousness. Raya has fully earned the benefit of the doubt. Yeah I know. I remember that being our Achilles heel under Poch too. Just really disheartening stuff for me VdV and Gabi XL are equals. they are both very reliable A very, VERY different one That Frimpong retired in 2019 and lives the high life in Ghana now. It wasn't actually. Mostly just blown away by how good Timber is and remembering¬† we have Tomi and Calafiori for depth and they'd walk onto most starting xi's in the champions League¬† Not a starter. Shit I'm glad you think that mate. But arsenal were that way for a long time before you started supporting them. Romero had no idea where Gabriel was. You don‚Äôt get given a foul for shoved in the back if you‚Äôre moving away from the player attacking the ball lmao > You are always in our threads  Yeah, I'm not though. I have no idea why you think my flair is of any relevance, and there's not a chance I'm the only person you've seen more than once in a thread about Spurs talking about them being shit. Find something better to do, eh? Yep, if they are willing to spend that much on him I‚Äôd sell him.  Dragusin does as well for a shift as he does. You suck at trolling. And Spurs have won‚Ä¶? Take your L and move on   Your backline is made of paper, two failed wingers playing fullback, a brain dead centerback and one sprinter covering 4 lanes. Your keeper is made of paper   I know it sucks to lose a game of football to men, maybe next year you‚Äôll get a win at your stadium I mean, if you think saliba, gabriel and ben white aren‚Äôt hard ig that's a take. Well ""the big 6"" is referring to the Premier League, they are clearly of the same calibre of those clubs in the league when they're consistently finishing in those positions? It's a pretty simple points system to be fair You literally didn‚Äôt bring a single soul down to earth mate, you just seem delusional beyond repair. He‚Äôs coached 0 derby wins in 42 games, 2 draw 5 loss. Man is playing failed wingers at fullback and braindead centerbacks in a system completely reliant on smart defenders   Ange would be getting sacked if levy had any bottle but ofcourse he doesn‚Äôt Saying Romero is better than Saliba and Gabriel because of one tournament nearly two years ago is brain dead. It‚Äôs not one game he‚Äôs cost Spurs every game this season Nah, they both consistently come up huge when the system breaks down. Romero is not capable of the individual recoveries that Saliba in particular has made. Just delusion to compare them. We invert our fullbacks so the midfield has Udogie, Porro, Sarr, Maddison, and Kulu. Do you want us to put 6 people in it?¬†  You can‚Äôt counter a Dyche-style bus of 4 CBs and two DMs parked in your defensive third. That‚Äôs a large part of the reason Brennan was useless this game. There was no transition  ¬†And you were getting bullied outside of your defensive third, hence the 65% possession. You had basically no opportunities outside of the goal in the second half¬† No more shitting on our holiday home. We own the üöΩ now Conceded from a corner - what a surprise. Not as if Spurs were famously poor at defending corners last season. No wonder the manager didnt think to practice that... Having your three first choice midfielders be out is normal?  Keeping coping from a home loss to Nottingham Forest brother. Yeah I can tell. He joined same season as them. Spurs had to buy half of their current team though. I think that number might also include Kulu and Porro's buy options that were triggered i think most have weirdly changed their tune after pulling off the miracle of 2024 and for good reason I don't understand what people are mad about. Right now there's a problem of quality in final 3d and set pieces. It doesn't have to be dribbling in 1v1. There's too many touches and lack of just direct on target finishing.  With Maddison looking tired team struggles but without him it looks completely toothless. Nobody really has it in them to be that man doing scoring.   Still game was way way better compared to Man united or Chelsea showing. Those games were a real pain to watch. They both looked not that good but they looked better and had more control. I‚Äôm not arguing they looked great and I shouldn‚Äôt have said ‚Äúgood‚Äù. The problem is you and your lot continuously tell people you‚Äôre on the level of Arsenal and that more than a single spurs player in this project has a chance of starting for Arsenal. That doesn't matter. As a fanbase we should have a stronger moral compass and showed more outrage Same tbh.  That and his comments in the treatment of Overmars Come on though.  How many women came out about Partey?  It was more than 2 for sure.  One I can question when it‚Äôs dismissed.  Wasn‚Äôt it closer to 5 with Partey though?  Unless they all know each other you have to start to be convinced‚Ä¶ Posting Twitter and thinking it‚Äôs indicative of reality üòÇüòÇüòÇ Spurs and Arsenal had the same amount of Xg. Spurs more by 0.01 so that's negligible. Arsenal were celebrating a draw away at City last year when they needed the win to take the title. Of course they‚Äôre going to be happy with today. That's fucking hilarious! Yes, I said that about 3 hours ago. And I‚Äôm not wrong. You guys shithousing a win playing 11 players behind the ball doesn‚Äôt change that. Bissouma and Richy You seem upset about bottling a lead Merino is an 8, not a 6. Partey has started for the last what‚Ä¶ 18 games for Arsenal and haven‚Äôt lost one game? You‚Äôll be surprised to see that Arteta won‚Äôt be benching him any time soon if he‚Äôs fit. Lets revisit this conversation. Arsenal got outplayed and saved by Raya! One thing I know is how to measure how teams match-up against each other across leagues.  Stylistically I knew Atalanta was gonna stuff Arsenal and would be extreme chellenge due to their high press, high energy and relentless playing style. The only reason we beat them in the Super cup was because we are resillient against press and in the middle of the second half they became tired just pressing and pressing and eventunally we took over the game. I knew Arsenal is not as resilient as Real Madrid hence I knew Arsenal was not gonna beat or threatened Atalanta they are not Spurs just headless high energy fooball Let‚Äôs not forget we have more wins against English clubs than losses. You mean our backup striker? Swear one of your best ever strikers played for us and was fucking shite? Not at all, it's Arsenal and City with the strongest defense. And I think Arsenal's is stronger considering City have the benefit of dominating possession in most games and face less attacking plays than Arsenal. Across the Top 5 leagues I'd give the edge to Inter but that's my personal opinion. Ah yes. Bc ""goals conceded"" is a direct metric of only the quality of the back4 and _nothing else_ Mfs breaking their backs to try and insult Arsenal somehow Genuinely delusional you fucking bozo üòÇ  Conceded less goals than both those clubs  I know Liverpool fans too well it seems They‚Äôve deleted their account! Massive headloss¬† My main point is that with the amount of money they have been spunking around they really should have a bit more talent up front.   It was always going to be difficult to replace Kane and I thought they got good money for him considering his contact situation. I think Solanke is decent but Atletico didn't pay all that much more for Alvarez. That's the level of player Spurs need to be targeting. Levy is money first, always. There was that weird stretch where Nacho scored in like 4-5 straight games lol I think for higher wages you can get a better old defender who is willing to sit on the bench. Mats Hummels for example or similiar. I don't think Kiwior is bad, but he needs time. He looked shaky and scared a few times he played for us. He is good enough to get my hopes up when he plays but not good enough to keep them up for more than 1 match. In his head he's got more goals than Pele, he just doesn't know why nobody counts them Well yeah, because leaving the house to socialize is foreign and complete fantasy to redditors It's pretty obnoxious if you actually watch us. What maddisson does he's been doing pretty well. I don't think we've been great this season but 4 in 4 doesn't necessarily tell the full story. We've played decently in many games but just been weak where it matters Depth can be strong and was referring to the midfield as a straight up back 4 - agreed mind I feel like Timber ends up at RB - Calafiori at LB and White ends up as backup RB/CB eventually no? Can‚Äôt argue based on the teams to date tbf - we are a lucky bunch! True, but even De Gea never really grew out of it either. Don't trigger my ptsd bro > Had Tottenham fans last season questioning why we signed Havertz over Maddison  in your imagination? Statically speaking, if they cross it a thousand times they're bound to score, right? Ange is the one who can‚Äôt get a tune out of them You're absolutely fuming üò≠ don't worry you still have lots of great players it could always be worse Ebbs and flows just like life, no? This guy pretends not to be u/TottenhamNole, who had his brain broken so badly by last season‚Äôs terrible run of form that he quit Reddit. You can tell it‚Äôs the same guy because they‚Äôre delusional and nonsensical Ohhh thank you! All a bit of projection at the end of the day I mean cmon you can‚Äôt be that delusional? A 1-0 loss against title contenders? Meanwhile you‚Äôre signing shit players to ten year deals? And your owners want to kill each other? Listen I‚Äôm not psyched about where spurs are but implying Chelsea is in a better position as a club is downright crazy lol It‚Äôs four games into the season and you‚Äôre talking about league position? lol Damn found another Arsenal fan who clearly hasn‚Äôt been watching games, you lot genuinely don‚Äôt understand football Genuine delusion. Spurs entire game plan is to bomb fullbacks forward. Pedro Porro crossed to no one all game today.   How is he one of the most dangerous fullbacks when he‚Äôs barely 2 more goals/assists than a defensive rock Ben white?   Porro is nowhere near as good as you think he is It would be weird to win MOTM if you weren't tested as a defender, wouldn't you say? Probably top 10 but nit comfortable. He doesn't get a sniff at city,arsenal or Liverpool.veach Probably have 3 better cbs Stop pandering  XL is clear I'd agree with that. Saliba is elite, those two are at a level just below that. Reliable but have a mistake or two in them. Fair! Says more about Spurs and Argentina than it does about anything else pal. Bruh hahaha. That was great banter. I love it. I never said it was a foul. I said he knew exactly where he was because he was shoved in the back. Find something better to do, like, go into Juventus thread and chat shit about random Juventus players and their manager?  Like that? Maybe cuz I‚Äôm not trolling? Spurs have won by not being Arsenal Hope that comment made you happier. We weren't good enough today, that's life.   You won't find my describing other grown men as hard because they try to intimidate other on a football pitch though. Not sure a paper defence would of only conceded one goal and around about equal xg Please define being hard You‚Äôve been the sixth best club in the league over the past 15 years, yes. There‚Äôs still a huge gap between spurs and the others. Hence it really should be the big 5. Closet Arsenal fan^  Not really delusional. Two players out isn‚Äôt a big deal, we had 6+ starters out last year still getting wins. Arsenal play like cowards and were incredibly fortunate to get anything today.   Their fanbase think two players out is a hardship, and clearly so do you. When they‚Äôve spent hundreds and hundreds of millions the past few years. That‚Äôs delusion. Bad tactics causing spurs to lose. Arsenal fans and their insane bias as always üòÇüòÇüòÇ lol You can't actually think Porro and Udogie play centrally, right? The most central they get on a regular basis is the half-spaces.   You absolutely can counter a team playing defensively. That's kind of the basics of coaching and setting up your team. We face parked busses 9 out of 10 games. What we don't do is put in 30+ crosses to stationary players in the box with no supporting runs to create space.  > There was no transition  You've hit the nail on the head here. You could not take advantage of us playing two geriatric men and a winger in midfield and did not expose their deficencies at all.  You had a lot of possession, and none of it was in the middle of the pitch. It was almost all out on the wings and very static. No overlapping, no beating defenders. Just keeping width and pinging in a cross to players who were standing still and waiting. Can someone point me to a statistic or highlight reel where Spurs created more and better chances than Arsenal?   Or maybe a heat map where Timber and White were playing as center backs? We've clearly got a new strategy defending corners, it's hard to miss the protection around Vic, just didn't work this time   If Romero had flopped that's probably waved off¬† 2 first choice midfielders. Someone can't be a starter if they haven't kicked a ball for you yet lol  But no, it's a fairly normal occurrence. Happened to plenty of teams last season and the season before I'd be wary of seeing Spurs having the ball as an advantage, Arteta is perfectly happy to sit his team deep and just force teams wide for them to cross and rely on Saliba, Gabriel and Raya to deal with it. Which is exactly what happened both in this NLD and the one away at Spurs last season.     Spurs struggled to break us down and that should be the mark of how well they played rather than how often they were allowed the ball in the middle third. You and your lot said you‚Äôre the best club in the history of the game. Said Madrid and Manchester United are minions compared to your history He didnt do anything.   The woman was sticking bom up for cash. You're just making stuff up now. The difference is Greenwood was recorded on audio, we all listened to the rape and assault.  Partey has had accusers but nothing has come of it other than some Snapchat messages which still weren't conclusive and then the case was dropped. It's very different.  I wish we got rid just to get away from it but I don't think anyone can say he's guilty. Greenwood had audio recordings and the victim themselves covered in blood confessing. And once that was posted online. There was no coming back. Regardless of any verdict Then stop lying with your ass that your entire fan base tried to cancel him. Just comparing the numbers is really poor. If they had more chances then it stands to reason that the chances were not great. You might create chances, but if they are low quality chances then you don't get goals. and you were celebrating a loss to City to miss Europe?  Sad fan with the same sad mentality of his favorite sad club What about winning at your ground 3x in a row and finishing roughly 20 points ahead of you for the last 2 seasons Game changers there lad, my mistake! Neither would make Arsenals full choice bench hahaha Haha fair play, mate. In the last 5 years, you've (Spurs) gone out in the CL round of 16 twice and failed to qualify 3 times (https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/clubs/1652--tottenham/). In the last 5 years, Atletico qualified every year, going out in the quarter finals 3 times, round of 16 once, and group stage once (https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/clubs/50124--atleti/). Just look at the records for the 2020s, add in the 2010s if you like (since you \[Spurs\] have the one final).  You (Spurs) are not on the same level of Atletico in terms of being attractive to talent, the only thing you can compete with them on is pay.  I adore Solanke (see flair, I do believe that with a bit of time he will come good for you), but your (Spurs') level was the next step up for him, not Atletico's level. Similarly for Alvarez, the slight step down from City to Atletico for consistent starting fit his talent, going to you (Spurs) would have been a larger step down. Yeah, you (Spurs) overpaid a little, but comparing yourself (Spurs) to Atletico is a bit laughable. You blew your banter opportunity lad La Cabra üêê We‚Äôre talking about a back up for Gabriel here, a player that has played pretty much every game in the PL since joining us. Kiwior is more than fine. Maybe longer term, but White is the best right back we have right now by a fair margin. Still haven't seen Calafiori play in the PL yet either. My issue with that is White has been extremely consistent at RB and hasn‚Äôt done anything to be dropped (although Arteta does have a bit of a ruthless streak so who knows).   I honestly have seen very little of Calafiori at this point so he‚Äôs a bit of an unknown quantity to me, but I think he‚Äôs got his job cut out for him in terms of breaking into the starting XI We won‚Äôt know till they try! not really mate just genuinely hope you grow out of whatever's causing you to find enjoyment in making other people feel bad just for the sake of internet points https://imgur.com/a/I9GKrh0 Chelsea can get relegated to League Two and I‚Äôd still find ways to make fun of Tottenham‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a football rivalry mate.. nothing personal >It‚Äôs four games into the season and you‚Äôre talking about league position?  ""Comfortably above them"" was referring to the team's quality, not the table position.  But thanks for reminding me to look at the table and see Chelsea are above Spurs there was well. You watched the City game last season and probably came to that conclusion lol Ah yes, you're the footballing prophet, ManBoobs13. Did understanding football help you lot cope with what happened with Forest? You just have blind hate my friend how is Spurs playing for the FBs when they never pass into channels where they can attack the ball, my friend you barely see them allowed to cross from the end line they literally look like they ordered to stay behind the wingers the entire game and never are allowed to do anything besides early crosses, how many times did you see odobert, Johnson, son and Werner go for the 1v2 instead of playing 1-2 with the FB moving into the channels. It's ok to hate people but at least try to be objective in your criticism. Romero checks his wrong shoulder on the goal and tried to run across gsbriel and let him in behind. Had no idea where his man was Do what you like, why would I give a fuck if you did? Having the flair of a team doesn't mean you're only allowed to watch games involving that team and comment on matters relating to that team.  I commented on a game I watched in which a recurring problem for Spurs cost them more points. For some reason you find this greatly offensive. I have no interest in what you post about anything anywhere else on this sub. Put it in the trophy cabinet You can‚Äôt describe your grown men as hard because they‚Äôre not. Glad I could clear that up for you Arsenal had 2 geriatrics in the middle of the park and still made more clear cut chances than spurs   Also spurs defence conceded more goals than Everton and Brighton last year Me after watching that win. If we're not talking about league finishes and we're considering other competitions, I think we should take it one further and make it the big 4 for the Premier League clubs who have actually done something in Europe Closet? üòÇ its enough to check my comments to understand that there is nothing to hide. Mate just stick to worrying about your own team and how you get out of midtable Angieball may be a meme but I didn‚Äôt realize he was instructing the players to forget to jump on corners. He should consider changing that tactic after today so he can get the best out of superstar Romero. Romero is fortunate to play for an Argentina side that can still win games when bleeding goals. Saliba came up with defensive plays in the last two years that are some of the best in league history. It‚Äôs terribly embarrassing for you to not be able to tell the difference between them. I don‚Äôt know what to say someone who is arguing that heatmaps are false. Udogie and Porro always invert and we did dominate the middle. Its in the data It happens but is not a normal thing. But keep on coping. And you wonder why people distrust men... When multiple accusers come forward there‚Äôs more to it.  One maybe two could understand but several???? It was reported that we were going to reintegrate him and the backlash from supporters was so overwhelming that the club had to renege.  What would you call that?  I‚Äôm sorry that your fans have no morals. I didn't bring up the number. Just pointing out that he was lying. Good god. Stop! He‚Äôs already dead. ü§£ I wasn‚Äôt celebrating a loss lol. You guys have been the better team the last two years. No disputing that. And yet you STILL come to our ground and park the bus. Embarrassing for you. Delusional. I'm not a Spurs fan. Nah he is exactly fine. Not more and not less. Lets just agree to disagree. I haven‚Äôt followed Arsenal that closely but does he ever play CB anymore? I think white was very good last season but I think sometimes his lack of pace and his occasional weaknesses in 1v1s can get exposed.  To be fair I think his 1v1 did improve last season and he was very good overall.  I think fit Tomiyasu is actually the best fullback I've seen at Arsenal for a long time.  He doesn't quite have the same ability and calmness on the ball as White but he's tall, fast, strong, good 1v1, good offensively.  It seemed to good to be true ... And it was. I don't know if he'll ever be able to stay fit and find form. Not trying to make you feel bad it's just the truth, if it makes you feel bad though that's your problem I'm sorry to tell you that Honestly I respect that. Fair. But the last thing I‚Äôll say is arsenal are a rival too? I get it we lost to Liverpool or something but That‚Äôs certifiably insane. But sure. Have fun with Nicholas Jackson and blind disabled owners. I don‚Äôt find it offensive at all. I find it very weird. Go get a real striker if you wanna win the league Irrelevant to my point.. [deleted] Xg was near equal and last time i checked its this year not last year, says as much about arsenals attack, which isnt injured then as it does out defence. I'm genuinely curious though, why are they hard and why is 'being hard' something that some people on here seem to look up to? Great, you wouldn‚Äôt be included in that either. You can‚Äôt go on about data and heat maps when you described the roles of White and Timber as center backs immediately before. You strike me as someone that hasn‚Äôt played much of the sport [Mate, is this ""central"" to you?](https://imgur.com/a/nyeSOGW) It's about as central as Saka, not at all what I'm talking about. Mate, don‚Äôt bother with Liverpool fans - they were prepped for a title challenge after their brave quadruple challenge last year and were brought back down unfairly yesterday. I think it happens to enough teams that losing 4-5 starters is considered normal Well thank god you're not in charge of the justice system.  There was two accusers. Find me something that says 5. At least let the proof come out that he is guilty to start tripping your balls like this. Greenwood has all the proof in the world and it was all other fan bases as well that put the pressure on. I have you proof of how your fan base still misses your abusive rapist so pipe down He wasn‚Äôt lying, you just don‚Äôt understand what he said. You were sulking that you lost to city? Hahahaha glorious we can‚Äôt be up 3-0 at half time every game mate. Maybe at the Emirates you can see that again x Not as embarrassing as losing home matches 3 times in a row to your biggest rivals. You can keep you‚Äôre morale victory if it makes you happy, we‚Äôll take the 3 points üëç Winning at your ground 3x in a row, very embarrassing yes Take the afternoon off mate I know three in a row must be rough Flair up then Not really because Saliba and Gabriel are usually fit which means they‚Äôll play. During preseason we saw Timber at cb while White stayed at rb. I don‚Äôt see white getting dropped unless there are fitness issues or a massive drop in form I agree I think Tomi is fantastic, unfortunately his mere existence seems to be something of a myth these days. You are absolutely spot on.  His lack of speed is a weakness that can be exploited > I think fit Tomiyasu is actually the best fullback I've seen at Arsenal for a long time.  Fucking hell mate, we're getting to the point that Tomiyasu's prolonged absence has led to people starting to seriously overrate him >You're in for a rude awakening when you realise ange isn't anywhere near as good as arteta, he'll be given the sack, mediocre club will just continue to see mediocrity despite their fans false hope  if you don't see this as something being said in bad faith then i don't know what to tell you mate oh i would‚Äôve made fun of them too if they lost today but they didn‚Äôt so‚Ä¶ unfortunately Chelsea haven‚Äôt beaten them recently either so have to keep my mouth shut *for now*ü§û  P.S. Chelsea and Liverpool hate each other probably more than Chelsea and Arsenal do btw Don't support Chelsea, but thanks I will have fun watching them being an objectively terribly run club and still battering you. Finding it 'weird' that people comment in post-match threads for football matches they just watched is a problem I can't help you with. It is entirely in your imagination that I post about Spurs more than any other club. Don‚Äôt need to mate we‚Äôve got King Kai up top. Not sure what you‚Äôre on about, this is sport. Intimidation, grit, determination are part of the sport, understandable you feel this way since your players don‚Äôt show any in 3 home derbies in a row We‚Äôre talking about our respective teams dear, not us. Yeah, crazy to complain about an attack that scored us a winner in a game our opponents didn‚Äôt create any major chances And you're the type who doesn't understand the difference between Colwill playing LB and Ben Chilwell as a LB. But please, enlighten me on why Ivanovic wasn't actually a CB because he played RB. You think I‚Äôm saying we should convict people and send them to prison with the same level of evidence?  Lmaoooo Your username is certainly appropriate. Make me. It's such a shame really.  He looked like he could be world class and I don't say that lightly but yeah a fit Tomi looks to be as elusive as a Tottenham Trophy (ok not quite but you know what I mean) Yeah perhaps I over rate him but he's had some absolutely fantastic games for Arsenal.  He doesn't have any glaring defensive weaknesses, can shut down most wingers, is good on the ball, surprisingly good at crossing and on the attack, is two footed, can pass.  He hasn't shown it enough to be considered the best so maybe I should have said the ethereal ""fit and in form Tomi"".  I really think he's shown a hell of a lot of ability, especially for someone who's barely had any consistent runs. lol I never said you post about spurs more than any other club. I said you‚Äôre oddly obsessed with Spurs. You have a very odd bone to pick with ange and I don‚Äôt understand it. You‚Äôve scored 6 goals this season‚Ä¶ ya need a real striker if you want to win the league I don't know how I can be more clear that I don't give two fucks whether or not our players are perceived as hard or not, I am not talking about that at all.   I'm wondering why I should fawn over men acting aggresively towards eachother, and analyse whether they are acting or not.   I understand that it is a sport and that grit, determination and heightened emotions are a part of that. I completely understand why players act that way. My point is, why should I say 'wow, X player is so hard for scaring Y player'? [deleted] The only decent thing in that game was Arsenal's defence, they scored the goal not the attack, the attack couldn't score any of these ""clear cut chances"" and if ya didnt think we had any major chances then ya didnt watch the game. Again, have a look at the heat maps of Ben White and Jurrien Timber and tell me what position they played today and throughout the season.  And if you staunchly believe this rigid viewpoint, then your bit about Udogie and Porro being central players falls apart. Which is the whole point, you‚Äôre picking and choosing things which are convenient for you to help swallow this loss. Hence my implication you‚Äôre a hypocrite.   Udogie does play in the middle and the channels, much the way Timber was everywhere (and a class above Udogie) today. Ben White would be Spurs‚Äô best right back and center back, but he very much played right back today, not center back. Well that's what you've been insinuating in your previous post calling him a rapist so either you want a rapist sent to prison like a normal person or you're just waffling. You choose. Your choice, don't blame me when people assume you're a fan of the incorrect team when you try to talk knowledgably about them Sure, but he's also shown to be fairly error-prone. Remember his huge fuck-up against City at Emirates in 22/23? Remember his awful performance against Liverpool in the League Cup semis? He's had plenty of fairly average games, coupled with some great ones and some pretty crap ones. He's alright, but he's not world-class. Our goalscoring record last season after we moved Kai to striker speaks for itself. Who‚Äôs asking you to fawn? Sport is like life, you are drawn to people who are intimating, show grit and steel. If you want to purposely pretend like that isn‚Äôt a big part of life, you do you   Your boys were scared today. Happens. You‚Äôre right mate, we are totally in the wrong celebrating our third win in a row at our rivals new aluminum stadium. Totally our fault   Take your L and move on You had one major chance that was a mistake and free shot and goal. We had a major chance in your 6 yard box. One converted other didn‚Äôt You don‚Äôt understand the concept of having a higher burden of proof needed to imprison someone than to sack them?  Jesus Christ If you had reading comprehension skills you wouldn't have assumed I was a Spurs fan considering I used ""they"" every time I referred to them. Exactly, not enough to win the league My point is, why is Gabriel as an example, hard, and why is that a point to brag about?  And whether it is Gabriel, Romero, or Van Dijk isn't relevant.  Seems a bit caveman-esque. [deleted] And yet Cristiano Ronaldo still plays football and went back to your club.   Leave off mate your just waffling. Oh how I love some pointless internet mudslinging on the weekend. Beer? Or a whiskey? Seems like you‚Äôve turned into a soft soy boy who doesn‚Äôt get out much. Hard men are literally the cornerstone of civilization since the dawn of time. Imagine being this upset to celebrate one in 2024.   Insanely stupid hill to stand on I‚Äôm celebrating our boys went to your home, robbed you and left with the 3 points, largely from being stronger more determined more intimidating. You can choose to be such a pissant about it, you do you   We can talk about the match. Spurs offered largely nothing because even against 2 geriatric midfielders they couldn‚Äôt muster up any courage or determination to attack arsenals backline   Match was over in the tunnel Capri Sun...awful paper straw. Pahahaha. Just came across this comment at random, wtf are you on about you weirdo hahahaha I get out plenty, thanks for the concern.   I'm sure your dad would beat up mine and you'd wear it as a badge of honour lmao. Your last comments give serious Andrew Tate vibes so there is probably not much of a point in taking this further at this point. [deleted] You absolute heathen, this conversation is OVER He‚Äôs complaining that his boys are soft so I can‚Äôt celebrate my boys who are hard. That‚Äôs simple No one is talking about our dads? We‚Äôre both commenting in a football subreddit sbout football regarding the game our two respective teams played? Where my teams steel grit and determination led us to our third victory in a row over your team?   Andrew Tate copout is such a pussy thing to say, I have nothing to do with him or no love for him. You pretending like this is about anything other than your sour grapes for Tottenham losing is hilarious ""Hard men are literally the cornerstone of civilisation"" pahahaha you sound like an absolute melt mate. I'll let you get back to wanking over a campfire. The dad line was a reference to middle school level arguments, it clearly wasn't very funny and didn't land. Sorry about the Andrew Tate comment. I wouldn't want to be associated with that insecure cunt either. You did start the personal insults though, calling me a 'soft boy who doesn't get out much' because I'm not impressed by the attempted physical intimidation of other men. Not sure why I should be and why my disinterest leads me to insult me, essentially calling me a pussy for it.  I've already admitted Spurs didn't do enough to win. I'm obviously dissapointed but this discussion about the silliness of expressing ones ""alpha male"" side is not about that. Ok soy boy, you do you. Literally every advancement in civilization came with a person who believed himself and didn‚Äôt take any other answers to achieve it.   Reason why I said this because spurs literally repeatedly quit at the first sign of struggle, like you so too All good mate. Clearly not going anywhere so let‚Äôs drop it here You make me laugh mate wtf is soy boy. You're pathetic. Wanking off on the internet about hard men. Shut the fuck up. Dickhead. You literally went out of your way to try and insult me on a conversation from 3 weeks ago. Massive soy boy energy. No one is wanking off; I was being told off to not celebrate a hard earned victory, this genuinely has nothing to do with you or your small club  You‚Äôre probably the other guy who I was talking to on a different account You're genuinely such a weirdo using the term fucking soy boy again without shame, I'm embarrassed for you. Fucking prat. Literally still replying to something I wrote weeks ago"

Been underwhelming for Ajax no? Why did he write the same sentence twice? Are Wolves aware of the fact that he's not good enough for them? He's barely good enough for this Ajax team. In fact I think he isn't, unless he significantly develops himself this year. Yes pls. Doesn‚Äôt fit a team that relies on ball control. Perfect player for a counterteam. We've about two wingers for them if they just go through our depth chart lol Ajax fans will be happy with this Chelsea is single-handedly raising the overall transfer spend as clubs will be forced to buy players when they do their weekly signing of a player. When did we all start calling him this instead of Carlos Borges? We was definitely Borges when we were linked before he went to Ajax. I only realised it was the same guy when I looked him up just now I was so confused as to who this guy was until I realized he changed his name from Borges.  Mad how you can go from being the potential next big thing to not being good enough for the Eredivisie just like that They always want Portuguese players right? Damn this would be a scam to their fans.  He‚Äôs really really bad at Ajax. He‚Äôs one of the few players that‚Äôs really fast, but isn‚Äôt dangerous at all. Can‚Äôt pass, can‚Äôt cross and can‚Äôt score. They overpayed big time for him.  Ajax fans will celebrate when he leaves. Portuguese and homegrown. Makes any Wolves owner‚Äôs mouth water Please, Premier League clubs, you're our only hope. Buy Forbs, Bergwijn, Henderson too for all I care.¬† Why don‚Äôt they just have Chelsea throw one of the attacking players they have in the deal Least shocking news of the day Wait, we're in for Pedro Neto? lol Man any of you guys want a Reiss Nelson? Is he a Mendes client? Do we have a sell on? Yeah like we literally have Antony lined up for them if they want to?? Like clockwork. Honestly really impressive. Unfortunately we have actually offloaded very little of them yet. He runs fast and is bad at anything involving a ball. Very, looked like a fish out of water despite battering u21 in the Premier League. City pulled a blinder getting as big of a fee as they did.. He usually says the same thing 3 times worded differently in the same tweet so twice is a rather short and concise statement from him Romano repetition special.   Literally read anyone of his tweets and hell have repeated the same thing at least twice. they are just doing it for the memes, they want to ponder the Forb Mendes is in charge and there's a young Portuguese player underperforming at another club ready to be transferred in, this is his wheelhouse He did have a pretty good preseason, I can see him develop this season a lot under Farioli. In which case he would be much more expensive, so I can understand teams taking a gamble on players that didn't perform at all with us last season, it could not have gone worse if you tried. Difficult to play well in that as a young player moving countries and making the step up to senior football. Depends on the bid honestly, we're expecting to sell Bergwijn and if we then also sell Forbs we're left with only a 19 year old winger on the left. The bid would need to be high enough for us to buy a replacement. Player‚Äôs choice, he changed the name on the back of his shirt. He was never the potential next big thing though, if he was he wouldn‚Äôt have joined Ajax He's on too much money for anyone to take a punt Yeah but would be over the profit and no way we turn a profit on this fraud [Looks like you do.](https://twitter.com/City_Xtra/status/1687190534865956864) Id take him back in a heart beat.   But you put him on insane wages so there is no way you are going to offload him. We have one Mudryk they can take on loan if they want He's very fast, he's disciplined, he works hard, he makes good runs and he doesn't shy away from defensive work. But on the ball he's weak, his first touch and any action from a standstill especially so.  Which is to say he's a player who can definitely fill a role for the right club and he ticks a lot of boxes for a modern winger. He's currently also doing ok for Ajax under Farioli but he's no star player, he's just far too technically limited. Ah so our Adama Traore regen has finally arrived I wonder why that sounds familiar? You would think being good with a ball would be a prerequisite for ‚Äúfootball‚Äù but what do I know It‚Äôs Forbin‚Äô time I hear what you're saying, but selling Forbs is like selling 5 G/A. Surely that's not too hard to replace. His PL2 record was excellent. I just mean from looking at City youth ready to step up to mens football I thought he'd be  possible prem player Such a disgusting deal. Mislintat is a fucking criminal. Except he was actually very technical. If you only look at G/A from him personally then no but that's very clearly not the only thing Farioli is looking at.   Wingers under Farioli need to stretch the opponents defense while in possession and they have to be responsible for a lot of the press when out of possession as it's their job to press while the midfield drops back to constric the space behind. They also need to make runs to be an option for the cross pass for our centerbacks. All of that requires a lot of speed and endurance. A really big issue for Ajax last season in an attacking sense was that between Bergwijn, Brobbey and Berghuis all 3 players liked to drop in to receive the ball which seriously constricted space and made it easy for opponents to defend.   Ideally I'd like to see someone in his place who's got all that and is technically gifted but then you're looking at either having to buy a talent who needs to grow into that which we have Godts for or they're likely out of Ajax' price range. For now Forbs is a useful player for Ajax even if he'll never ever be a fan favourite or a star player. Well he still is lol, if Wolves are getting him. My point was that if he were the next big thing his trajectory would have been more like Palmers, or now Bobbs West Ham was about to pay the same and there is a good chance we‚Äôll sell him without much loss, so it wasn‚Äôt actually that strange a deal. Yes but a year ago it didn't feel like he was much behind Bobb. Palmer, yeah.   And players like Sancho have gone abroad before and then caught fire at Dortmund, so I kind of expected a player Ajax spent a big fee on to do a little better Stealing away a pace merchant from a team that actually sits deep and counters. Whoohoo got em. The guy was never going to fit and this should have been clear to everyone at Ajax.   3rd spot was up for grabs last season, imagine if instead of Forbs they got an average or maybe even a good player that fits the team. Even with the money back it was a waste of a season for both him and the club. Nah he was much behind them.  Ajax had Mislintat last year and spent loads of money on talent that didn‚Äôt fit, which is why we‚Äôre broke af now. The way you phrased it sounded like you were criticizing the deal itself, so the terms etc. You responded to someone mentioning a sell on clause.   Now you make it about the player itself and the fit with Ajax, which is something different. You should have phrased it differently if that was what you were criticizing. What do you mean? The player is what the terms got them, they are not separate things. You can't talk about any deal without talking about the player. Up to TWENTY million for Forbs is what it says in the tweet and a sell on clause on top of that. That is criminal.  Should have left the table when the price got anywhere near double digits, let West Ham have him."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* Nice to see Carra do my Minteh propoganda for me Not getting used to that LFC logo. It looks cool but the previous crest was instantly recognizable. Ffs Gary, just pick one manager to watch lad Neto as his impact signing but the team he's on won't place top 6 Neville genuinely has the most batshit predictions every year. Carragher rates Minteh and H√ºrzeler but couldn‚Äôt remember the managers name, back to quietly doing well rather than the constant bum licking of De Zerbi. Newcastle are going to surprise them. Think they are underrating Newcastle. My wildest take of the season is that Liverpool will be very good this season and will actually be in the title race all the way to matchweek 38 No Liverpool in top 4 is certainly a take Top 4 race is going to be a bloodbath this year. Every point is going to matter more than ever. Liverpool finished 19 and 22 points ahead of Chelsea and United respectively.  Having both of them in top 4 is absolutely bonkers. Chelsea in fourth would absolutely insane if it happened That Liverpool side is stacked and could fight for the title. Putting them outside the top 4 is silly. Do they think Leicester will get relegated cause of a potential points deduction or do they believe they can‚Äôt survive purely football wise?? I seriously don't get the chelsea top 4 takes. That club is a mess. Eddie Howes under the radar mags. No bias‚Ä¶from either of them. None at all Newcastle has no eurupe, a decent stable squad, and a good manager. If they stick free or injuries then they will surprise a load of pundits. They're being overlooked. All but one of the BBC football pundits had Newcastle out of the top four.  As for Neville putting both Chelsea and Man United ahead of Liverpool just shows his bias and stupidity. Extremely unlikely. Neville has been shit talking Arsenal for years. 100% this is a ploy Ten Hag as manager to watch? What is he gonna do? Make Antony score 90 goals? Punditry ain't that it used to be Gary has completely lost his mind. No Liverpool in the Top 4? Below Chelsea? Pedro Neto being an impact signing, and still not having Chelsea top 6 certainly is something Gary Neville once again having one of the predictions of all time. In the segment on 'Impact Signing' Carra stated that Neto, and I quote, ""*Scores goals, he's a goal scorer""* which is laughable because in 112 appearances he's scored 11 goals. That's it, 11. What a fierce goal scorer he is..  Awful punditry from one of the supposed 'best' on TV. How can man say Pedro Neto and then not have Chelsea in the top 6 üòÇ what‚Äôs he gonna do? Score 15 PL goals to propel them to 9th? Sound, I don't mind us being underestimated Neville putting us 4th after dissing us so much yesterday feels weird. Wonder if he's doing it to try and win some of our fans back to his side. Nonetheless, would be absolutely delighted with that placement if it happens Neville predicting Man Utd finish 3rd. Absolutely ridiculous. ü§£ü§£ü§£ gary just wants to watch who‚Äôs the fraudiest of the bald fraud Unrelated but kudos to Liverpool for using that version of their badge/logo‚Ä¶much prefer it to the other one Nonsense, Emery will get Manager of the year with Villa repeating a top 4 finish Can't believe Carra didn't pick Big Meeks Interesting to see what impact will pedro neto create if chelsea are not ending up in european places. Minteh is gonna be a 120m player by the end of the season Chelsea & man utd above Liverpool ? Garry neville trying to mess with Carra or proper hopium as  a utd fan (unless there is an injury crisis at Liverpool) . Wait.. Liverpool out of PL or what? Remindme! 9 months My manager to watch is also Ten Hag, Slot Maresca. He looks like quite the manager. Neville having United 3rd is obviously just bias. Chelsea 4th is insane. ‚ÄúEuropean contender‚Äù he picked a team who already are, I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs there for someone to challenge this season who don‚Äôt necessarily expect it. ‚ÄúImpact signing‚Äù solanke but they‚Äôll drop to 6th. Picks 3 managers in the last one A couple of morons‚Ä¶ the definition of talking heads Not sure why carragher thinks Ipswich will stay up, very interesting take Didn't see it, but guess it went something like: noooo Garrrri, iz gonna be citeeeeh, dopi-do-pi-do!!! Carra should have went for the cheeky City relegated Neto is an impact singing so Chelsea stays in the middle of the table‚Ä¶good way of thinking Both are such clowns, one doesn‚Äôt have chelsea even at 7th and other have chelsea at 4th Have they swapped their impact signings or something? They make no sense based on where they've put their respective clubs. Or do they mean negative impact? No way in a million years are Man United and Chelsea getting third and fourth. Don‚Äôt know what Gary‚Äôs been smoking. Obviously City will win it again, and I think United and Chelsea will struggle to make too 4 again. No offence but no one is watching ten Hag lol. If you want to be different say Hurzeler or something What crack is Neville smoking with Chelsea in top 4 Neto an impact signing but Chelsea not in Top 6? What is he smoking? Neville is such a clown pundit Neville is a bit of a moron Neville is a fucking wanker.  No villa? Two spunktrumpets. Solanke is the impact signing and tottenham gets 6th? Chelsea fans on here yapping they got the ‚Äú4th strongest squad‚Äù meanwhile they ain‚Äôt even got a good goalkeeper smh Bold of you to assume we will be above Liverpool mate. [deleted] Gary neville always bottles this Well if Gary has us at 1st place, it's another 2nd place for us.  I still can‚Äôt believe Gary Neville is a sport pundit.   Arsenal winning the League, Chelsea making top 4 lol Are pigs falling from the sky or did Gary Neville really predict arsenal to win the league Nevilles 3 and 4 is genuinely delusional I don‚Äôt understand how you can have Manchester United ahead of Tottenham or Southampton ahead of Ipswich found myself agreeing with Gnev on this but then i saw the placements of chelsea and liverpool and i m like what.. i do think liverpool could really struggle 2nd half of the season given lack of squad depth if they re hit with injuries similar to united last season etc but come on man.. i dont think chelsea will be as bad as most people think tbh but .. you should still swap the 2.. Took me a while to find Liverpool. Did they change their logo or something? Manager to watch‚Ä¶.. lists 3/20 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ah fuck, the Neville tick of approval feels like a death knell. Imagine Leicester finishing top 4 They don't have De Ligt as impact signing? Last year United had games without ANY centre backs, can't see who else will make more of an impact Who‚Äôs the bigger idiot I really hope he does well, he was good for us and always worked hard, but the end product often lacked. He is fantastic and I can‚Äôt wait to see him tear up the league. He was fire against Everton. It looks like he will suit Brighton well I am annoyed the owners decided to start using that badge in all media coverage rather than our proper badge.  The Liver bird and LFC on the kit is really nice but our badge being used otherwise is unique and I love it. took me reading your comment to realize it was Liverpool.¬† Lmao why is it fuckin WHITE!?   Looks like spurs haha theyll gonna curse themselves arent they I much prefer the Liverbird tbh I can't lie I was looking for Liverpool in the list for ages. I thought Carra was trolling. I was wondering if they both hated Liverpool, but there it was all along [deleted] fkn hate it, old one was class i want the old badge back Managers to watch: Guardiola, Arteta, Ten Hag, Slot, Maresca, Emery, Howe, Postegoclou, Cooper, McKenna, Frank, Dyche, O'Neil, Glasner ... Looks less like Man U bias if you throw a couple more in there.  4d chess thought up during his last mini retirement. Same with Neville saying Solanke and Spurs 6th. They finished 5th last season, good impact that.¬† Palmer was impact signing last season and they finished 6th. It's not impossible. We weren‚Äôt that far off of it last year, with a worse squad, and injuries everywhere. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs likely, but it‚Äôs definitely possible. The talent is absolutely there. The palmer effect I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Has to be trolling now. He absolutely slatted Chelsea and questioned why any player would want to go there? I'm surprised to see that he is so highly rated. I am for him, but I was just not aware of his popularity. It does not say positive or negative impact ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Carragher isnt even trying to hide his Chelsea hate. I remember him saying in twitter how all the successful Chelsea academy players were bought from other clubs, even though most of them were at the club from 8 or 9, some even younger than that. Carragher can't look past  his hatred for Chelsea and think logically In fairness, players can have amazing seasons but their team can underperform. Palmer at Chelsea is a clear example, although I do recognise they did actually get 6th. He never said the impact was going to be positive That's what he's being paid for Meh, predictions is all a bit of fun really isn‚Äôt it?  Don‚Äôt know why people love to get worked up about this stuff (not talking about you but others I‚Äôve seen in response to this post).  Going for an outside shout is what it‚Äôs about. Neville‚Äôs predictions every year are just things that he wants to happen. Batshit seems a little ott but a tad on the wild side.  It's tough to see Liverpool outside the top 4 let alone behind Chelsea though. I don't think there's anything *that* batshit about his predictions except Timber being a player to watch, Maresca a manager to watch, and maybe United 3rd. Though I think 3rd and 4th are wide open, and any of Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea, United, Villa and Newcastle could very feasibly finish there.  And I think Arsenal winning the league after being 2 points off is just as reasonable as any time people predicted Liverpool to win the league under Klopp. What's batshit there? I found it hilarious that he apparently had Spurs in his top 4 before the game last night and then they ended up 6th... lol [deleted] I think the Chelsea call is loose but what‚Äôs weird about it? What is so batshit about those? They all seem atleast somewhat reasonable. He does it on purpose, no other reason tbh I dont think this is the first time he's predicted arsenal to win the leagueüôÑ  And chelsea in Europe??? That too top 4???  Im a (realistic) chelsea fan and i do not see that happening at all!!!!! He has 0 ball knowledge Solange making such an impact to help Spurs make 5th place. That and ""This is Manchester United..."" are sort of his trademarks You have no idea how much that bloke riles up our fans, spending so long talking shit about us and saying 4th place was the best Arteta will get  out of Arsenal and should move to a bigger side like united, constantly trying to be as divisive as he possibly can whenever we lost, drew or struggle to get a win.  He had so many Arsenal fans slating him on twitter and he even mentioned it multiple times... and now? he predicts we win the league and Spurs finish 6th? I can tell you now many of our fans will say he is making  these predictions on purpose because deep down he knows that our fans also know that he is doing it to get a rise out of us, like he knows that we are going to question his scheme. Oh don‚Äôt worry, a result on the Saturday early kick off against United and the hipsters will be back in full force Not having Europe to worry about throughout the season is definitely an advantage. !remindme 9 months Injuries wiped them out last season. If they can stay fit and manage to sign Guehi, yeah I think they can be right up there in top 4. Reckon they‚Äôll finish 4th in my unprepared and uneducated opinion. Neville put them in for a European contender, more than they deserve.  Be lucky to finish 7th and scrape a EUCL, they were pants last year and havent improved in the summer except for getting Tonali back, I dunno where these wild ambitions are coming from. If Slot can do that in his first season with no incoming signings then we are in pretty great shape. I think for most LFC supporters, Top Four is the minimum, ""in the Title Race in May"" would be great, and Top 4 + a Trophy would be ideal. Not sure we'll go quite that far, but I think we're certainly being underrated in this thread, especially by United supporters.  I think this is an 80+ point squad. United supporters love pointing to their injury crisis last year when we had a similar one and still finished over 20 points ahead of them. In terms of games missed we weren't far behind. I believe I watched that studio, where they did this. Gary got provoked by Carra's take on United, so he bumped Liverpool down out of spite. Pretty funny to watch tbh Not really. Liverpool were 3rd last season with one of the greatest managers in history. Slot isn't as good as klopp and is at a new club so there will be growing pains. Not saying they won't make top 4 just that it's not a terrible take or anything It is possible but Chelsea finishing above Pool is a laugh [deleted] Villa, Chelsea, United, Liverpool, Newcastle, Tottenham sheesh Every year people fall for this fallacy, I guarantee you teams will perform below expectation, as what happens every year.   I don‚Äôt even think this is a particularly strong year even, lots of questions marks over the contenders They lost the most important person at their club and have failed to strengthen Also spent more time at the top of the league than any other team last season and people quickly forget were on course to possibly win it in March.   No way United *and* Chelsea get third and fourth. Also lost their legendary manager and did not stengthen their squad at all for now.. No more too manager, a squad that declined towards the end of last season that was not reinforced.  They aren‚Äôt nailed on to finish top four at all. also signed nobody, no klopp and key player contracts are running out + have 0 squad depth though. id still have them in top 4 over chelsea tho personally. what nev predicts COULD happen but i dont think its likely. if he s going for a wild card prediction i respect it but he should be express about it. Go back last 5 seasons. Liverpool and United have finished higher in each alternative season with the season where Liverpool finished above, they finished above by so many points. It has happened in reality so for it to happen in a prediction, not sure why you are making it sound ridiculous. lol Liverpool have a weaker squad, a worse manager and Chelsea have done the opposite and improved their squad and got a manager better suited to the team. I see Liverpool dropping and Chelsea gaining this season. Makes sense to me. Not really we were 5 points off with a shit ton of injuries to big players, we could genuinely finish anywhere from 4th to 7th Is it really though? We were in much worse shape to start last season and were a five points off from 4th. I rate them as 4th. If Nkunku stays healthy, Palmer and Cucurella stay on this level, and they stop wasting time on Enzo and Mudryk. But most importantly, if Maresca can actually implement a lock-down defensive structure. They have so many players that can create for themselves that the team should really be structured as 70-80% defensive focus. 4th strongest squad getting 4th would be unheard-of. Chelsea were fourth on form table for second half of last year. Sure, maresca is a new quantity and might take time, and we have lost gallagher, but still it isn't outrageous at all They‚Äôre basically the same team as last year and now under a worse coach. Why would they suddenly be so much better this year? Calling it stacked is a bit of a stretch. Also they will probably have growing pains under Slot I thought they looked decent against city Everything outside of the main 24 man first team squad sure. But the media narrative about the squad size is definitely getting to you. Chelsea have more experience than last season, made improvements in the squad, a healthier squad. So long as enzo implements his football I can‚Äôt see any other reason as to why we won‚Äôt improve our league position and be close to top 4. Because we were one game away last season despite a major injury crisis and tactical dinosaur in charge. Banter aside they have a great first 15. The only downfall is keeping cole palmer on the right I have you finishing 4th this year. I think your lack of European competition is being slept on a bit. Shhhhhh He predicted them to win last year too This isn't complicated, he just does it to not put City top, with 115 charges and look after his side of Manchester.  But also hopes Arsenal can push on and beat City rather than Liverpool. Arsenal were the team he knew to compete. Simple. I mean City has weakened and Liverpool will most probably take some time to actually play with this new system. It's definitely theirs to grab. No, no, the pundit hates my team, not yours! He did it last year as well, he‚Äôs tired of just getting harassed by Arsenal fans even though he was almost bang on about the 22/23 season and how they‚Äôd drop off spectacularly. everything he said about them was factual. they bottled top 4 then bottled the league twice. this season city are significantly worse and they kept reinforcing especially depth wise and their players got more experience + .. genuinely .. honestly.. as someone who never rated havertz.. he s been class last season and started really classy in the opener again.. they play the best football now and have good squad depth with quality not just numbers and have been getting progressively better. city are worse this season, doesnt matter who you are or how you slice it, its the truth + jan onwards we could have a ruling on them so.. yeah. thinking person's pick to win the league should be arsenal this season. Lol he put us 4th (more optimistic than most Chelsea fans I think) despite shit talking us every time he commentates us. Or maybe he just hated cucurella that much. or maybe there is a club that Neville likes for some unknown reason and is biased towards it could win europa and finish 3rd if we sign ugarte and dont have an injury crisis like last season and clubs like liverpool suffer injuries when they have no depth and did 0 business so.. yeah he s one to watch. if he bottles it without injuries after we signed the players we signed + we ll probably mostly likely sign ugarte as things are going.. its unavoidable he ll be sacked and ruud is gonna take over till end of season.. Cole Palmer scored 22 goals to propel them to 6th by only 3 points (and way behind 7th on GD) last season, so it's not impossible! I think people think pundits care more about that sort of thing than they do, I doubt he's chasing the approval of Chelsea fans. I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs anticipating a big drop for Liverpool since that‚Äôs what we saw at United. United would be put higher cause they‚Äôre his boys. That leaves us or spurs which imo is a toss up about who will be better this season. Another year in Sons legs and hoping Solanke fills the Kane hole will make it tricky for them. Why would he give a shit what Chelsea fans think about him hahaha City game probably impressed him Aye he's predicting Chelsea 4th to win the approval of internet nobodies. Do you hear yourself? On paper it's not a terrible prediction, if the team stays fit, with some great new signings (Zirkzee, De Ligt, Yoro, Mazraoui And Possibly more) a top 3 finish is possible, I'd guess 5th personally but when has neville ever said anything that wasn't full of bias anyway Why is it ridiculous > kudos to liverpool  thousand yard stare I love the Liver Bird and LFC combo on the kit but prefer the proper badge on things like this personally. I love our full badge. Make it make sense. United got third or better in 3 of the 5 last seasons.. Its very close between city and villa. Nothing compared to the crack he is smoking to place United 3rd. I mean Palmer was probably last years impact signing and they finished outside the top 4 then They are newly promoted and weaker than the team they were relegated with. Plus there is a points deduction of some kind on the way.  That said they were really good in the second half last night and Jamie Vardy clearly has a few more goals in him, so maybe people have written them off too early. He also put both United and Chelsea over Liverpool Liverpools bench is Nunez, Gapko, Elliot Bradley, Gomez and Tsimakas Konate Jones and Endo and Kelleher That‚Äôs before they buy anyone. Tbf theres a world in which our starting cb partnership is yoro and martinez so its not all that crazy that he dont have de ligt here especially cause he dont even rate him too highly I hope he flops at this point. Can't believe we're ended the transfer window in a worse position for RW. I prefer it personally, but in graphics like this it should be gold/yellow. Might be in the minority but I love the minimalism of the Liverbird. Obviously love the standard crest too. >I am annoyed the owners decided to start using that badge in all media coverage rather than our proper badge.  Ah so that's why FotMob switched to this badge suddenly, thought they just messed around on their own I really, really hate this trend to not use badge on kits.   Since they switched something is always off for me with Liverpool kit. Hopefully they will come back to badge. Yup, particularly as the Eternal flames and Shankly Gates are missing... for a club with so much history those are important symbols. We changed it back in 1988 & 1999 to add the shield, the gates and most importantly the Hillsborough flames. It was always decide that once justice was given, we would return to the Liver bird. It has nothing to do with the owners, Nike or anyone new. This decision was made before I was even born and I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve stuck to it.   We changed the kit to have the flame on the back, and go back to the original design (obviously slightly tweaked) but the one you know is only from 2002. I'd argue that the Liverbird **is** the traditional crest though! It's far more traditional than the previous one. That isn‚Äôt right mate. Bro‚Äôs not watching Lopetegui He just wants to tell us we should watch all the games, duh I mean Kane was league top scorer when Spurs finished 7th in 20-21, and scored even more goals in 22-23 when they finished 8th.  You can still have an impact even if your team doesn't. Hey, it doesn't say positive impact! Yes but they came 10th the year before so Palmer dragged them up 4 spots. In this case the impact Neto is supposedly having is dropping them down at least 2 places I think he just means it's weird to say they have the impact signing while also presumably being an average team. I'd imagine his counter point would be Palmer who was arguably the impact signing of the year on a similarly average side. That's his point, no? You guys were almost there and have *the* impact signing according to his prediction, but then won't make European spots lol You have a worse manager (or unproven in top leagues) this season.  If you still had Pochettino , after the strong finish you had , everyone would have had you in top 4/5 this season . Solanke to have a big impact lifting spurs from 5 to 6th lol And if you ever listen to them actually explain their answers you know they‚Äôre not overly serious and state their biases. Neville even said when picking United top four that he HAS to, he doesn‚Äôt necessarily think they will but it‚Äôs his team and he‚Äôs gonna root for them to get it. I actually don't mind these predictions because theres a lot of variance.   Often its just boring safe picks. I don't think he wants Arsenal to win the league (or maybe he does because it's the lesser of two evils in his eyes). Like Man U finishing above Liverpool! Lmao. I'm more optimistic than he is, but I can see why he'd expect Liverpool to have a tough first year after Klopp. It's big shoes to fill, and they haven't signed any players yet.   It's also better than the recent pre-Klopp average. Between 09/10 and 15/16 (Klopp's first year when they came 8th) they only came 6th, 7th, and 8th, except for the infamous Gerrard slip year when they came 2nd under Brendan Rodgers, so he thinks the club at least is left better than before Klopp came in.  If things stay as they are transfer wise, the question is essentially how many places was Klopp's direct benefit on the team worth, and he's saying ~3, with maybe a little how much of an impact does standing still have when rivals sign players. What's wrong with Timber being the player to watch? As someone who‚Äôs watched a whole lot of timber, I disagree with that being batshit insane. He started for us when he was like 17. His development stalled a bit because our team was falling apart and asked him to lead our entire team, then he went to arsenal and got injured, but he‚Äôs really, really good. >I think 3rd and 4th are wide open, and any of Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea, United, Villa and Newcastle could very feasibly finish there.  Putting both Chelsea and United to finish above Liverpool AND YET having Spurs, Villa, Newcastle below them is pretty bat shit if you think about it.   It's betting that both Chelsea and United somehow pull off 20+ point swings on Liverpool WHILE Liverpool still perform well enough to beat Spurs, Villa and Newcastle.  i.e. predicting massively improved performances from United and Chelsea while having significant underperformance from Liverpool and SEVERE underperformance from Spurs, Villa and Newcastle.   That combo is pretty fucking batshit, I don't think Gary thought out the entire permutations and just pegged it by individual club. Honestly there's city and arsenal and then the next 8 spots are kinda up in the air. ‚ÄúMaybe United 3rd‚Äù - United have been so poor for over a year now. 8th last year was a generous placement for their actual level of play, 3rd this year would be an exceptional season Why is Maresca not a manager to watch? First season in a top flight, managing a wildly unstable club, and then you‚Äôve got the whole Pep protege narrative. He‚Äôs absolutely one to watch. I am once again begging people on this website to actually watch football. If you watched any of timber‚Äôs minutes in the last 2 pre seasons you‚Äôd get it Nah, United 3rd and Chelsea 4th is genuinely batshit Liverpool not even making CL places while Man U and Chelsea do? I literally said to myself ""That is batshit"" before I even got to this thread. I'm as optimistic of a Chelsea fan as you'll find, but no fucking way we finish above Liverpool. I'm happy to be proven wrong come May however. I don't think it's batshit but I'd imagine he's referencing United finish ahead of us. Yall are acting like we came in 16th Or he believed what he said at the time. Why do you lot take it so personally? Getting this riled up over a pundit with a United bias is sad behaviour lol All this is showing is how many Arsenal fans are brainlets needing to concoct dumbass conspiracy theories to explain everything they don't like.  They're so invested in needing to hate Neville that they wouldn't be able to handle the idea that for every time Neville has criticised Arsenal over the last two-three years, there's another occasion where he's gassed them up. Which is weirdly exactly what you would expect from a team that have gradually moved from top 4 to title contenders over that same amount of time. Mate, keep crying over a pundit Good thing ten hag will make sure that won't happen My only concern is that when a team gets that many injuries there‚Äôs often a reason for it, in terms of training, fitness staff etc. You can say this or similar for pretty much all of Chelsea, Villa, United, Spurs, Newcastle though - its really tough to pick this year especially with the extra unknown of how West Ham and Liverpool do under new managers How did injuries wipe Newcastle out and not Man United lmao. Context always given for smaller teams I get it though Without injuries I think they could finish above you Buzzing to come back to this one in May! Honestly don‚Äôt know where half the takes come from on this site, but it‚Äôs definitely not from watching football. RemindMe! 25 May, 2025 But it‚Äôs the Barclays, innit?  You lot still have multiple title winners in that squad. People didn‚Äôt think Chelsea would win the league in 09/10 or 16/17 when we got new managers if I recall correctly This is from yesterday MNF, Carra did not provoke Gary and Gary did not bumped Liverpool down out of spite. You were dreaming.   Gary said that Klopp was one of the best managers PL saw and you cant replace him so he believes there will be pain along the way and Liverpool will not get TOP 4.   He got rinsed on Chelsea and MU by Carra tho.  If someone bumped club down it was Carra with Chelsea, started at maybe top 6 to not even include them in top 8 conversation It's still higher than he has us on the Stick to Football thing. His ""wild take"" was liverpool not making top 6 United did finish above Liverpool two out of the last four years lol. I mean he put them below Chelsea too. One of the biggest works in progress I've ever seen. I guess they think u will have a post fergie/wenger fall off. I don't see it though, the squad is too good We've finished ahead of you 2 out of the last 4 seasons though? Hardly that outlandish And in 50% of those cases the United pundit has been correct you utter clown Villa, Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham sheesh I think that's exactly what makes it strong though.  Spurs: Just don't seem able to kick on, Solanke will help but don't seem to know their best team atm  Villa: Don't know how they'll cope with UCL games every week, especially with the extended format.  Chelsea: Ridiculous depth of talent, but barely look like a football club at times  United: Awful, awful season with injuries but made good signings in defence and seem to be playing with a bit more control  Newcastle: Another awful injury crisis year, but showed the year previous what they could do with a much worse squad than they now have  Even drag Liverpool into it as truthfully nobody knows how extreme the drop-off may be from Klopp  It's going to be fun to watch ""Failing to strengthen"" a team that weren't actually weak doesn't = -20pts to me. True. But Chelsea are still a basket case & United ended last season with a negative goal difference. Personally I‚Äôd be very surprised if either of them finish top 4. Strengthened last year with a midfield overhaul. Crazier thing is he's predicting Liverpool to have 20 points downswing on both United and Chelsea WHILE still being good enough to finish above Villa, Spurs and Newcastle.   The man is predicting simultaneous collapse for 4 clubs that outperformed United and Chelsea at various levels last season. That is true but we were still comfortably very much the 3rd best team in the league. Both City and Arsenal both looked and were statistically much better than us even when we were top. Liverpool last season were just..... clutch beyond belief. There is no other way to describe it, the defence was honestly pretty awful at times, if it wasn't for Allison saving what felt like 3 or 4 one on ones each game then we would have been nowhere near it.  Its just our attack was also by far the best in the league, especially if you go off XG.  XG:   Liverpool: 95   City: 90   Arsenal: 84  I still think its daft to think we wont get top 4 though. I feel that most people are putting Liverpool in the Chelsea, Spurs, United, Villa camp. But I think its still City - Arsenal - Liverpool - everyone else.   The shocking thing is replacing Liverpool with United. United should have finished 16th last year based of of expected points. The outperformed their expected points by 20 and this includes outperforming their XGA by a whopping 17 goals, that would usually indicate you had the best keeper in the world in goal but we all saw that Onana had a slightly below par performance for most of the season.  Last year should have been their complete wipe out year but somehow they managed to do ok in the end. If they perform anything like they did last year then they will not get as lucky a second time. What are you on about? We have two great goalkeepers, two great right backs, four centre halves assuming Sepp gets sold, two left backs, a load of midfielders, and five forward options.  Where exactly do we lack in depth? The one thing you can level at us is that we lack a quality defensive midfielder, but so does half the league.  Key player contracts running out have absolutely nothing to do with how we'll perform this season, if anything the players will want to perform better to ensure that their next contracts are massive. I think we are likely to finish higher than United, so if Chelsea doesn't make it for sure, United doesn't.  United lacks a midfield, and their attack isn't too impressive either Yeah but the only reason United finished above Liverpool in those seasons was due to Liverpool suffering disasters that were unpredictable and out of their control.  In 20/21 Liverpool had an injury crisis at CB which not only seen Henderson and Fabinho play CB at times but also led to the club making emergency signings in January, who then also got injured. I think Liverpool had something mental like 17 or 18 different CB partnerships that season.  And in 22/23 the club basically went the season with no midfield due Thaigo, Ox and Keita missing much of the season through injury and Fabinhos legs going at the age of only 29 and his performances falling off a cliff. Every game was like playing with 10 men.  The last time United finished ahead of Liverpool on merit must have been Klopps first or second season, I can't remember.  Like sure, something like that could happen again leading to United finishing above them, but would you bet on it? I wouldn't. >Liverpool have a weaker squad, a worse manager and Chelsea have done the opposite and improved their squad and got a manager better suited to the team.  There's some absolutely shit takes in these comments but this is comfortably the worst one in here, so congrats on that. At least you‚Äôre confident in your delusion. Lmao. Liverpool doesn't have a weaker squad. We have basically the same squad that made an embarrassment out of Chelsea last season, with kids that beat them in final and an XI that thrashed them 4-1 at Anfield.  ""Worse manager"" isn't the diss you think it is when you're comparing him to Jurgen Klopp, one of the greatest managers to ever grace the Premier League and the only one to win a title during the Man City dominance era. He was the only reason they didn't win 7 in a row. However, Slot is no clown. He got Feyenoord to the Conference League final in his first season, then won the Eredivisie and the Dutch version of the FA Cup the season after. Then in his final season, he finished 2nd and that was only because PSV had the greatest run in the club's history. Slot has impressed in pre-season, beating both Man United and Arsenal. He's won his first game against Ipswich, which should have ended about 5-0 given the second half performance from subs.  Conversely, Maresca has had a poor pre-season and lost at home to a Man City that barely even tried and without their best player. They looked completely unready, especially in the first half.  I see nothing to suggest that Chelsea will be able to finish above Liverpool, even with the lack of LFC signings and new manager in charge. There is a long way to go, but it does not make any sense to me. >Liverpool have a weaker squad  based on what? we've lost players that never played   >a worse manager  pochettino is better than maresca too   >and got a manager better suited to the team  how do you even know this, its been 1 game where you lost at home, to a city team who barely lifted a finger   >I see Liverpool dropping and Chelsea gaining this season. Makes sense to me.  you're not making up a 20+ point deficit without some freakish act of god.  you clowns said the same shit last year and then weren't in the same half of the table as us for 90% of the season. you got thoroughly humiliated by a bunch of kids who had barely played senior football. stop thinking about us. Your range of outcomes is a lot wider than 4 spots. what big players were injured for longish periods of time besides Reece? That was because poch ball had Palmer cooking. I doubt he‚Äôll have the same impact if he‚Äôs being restricted into a facilitator role like he is under marsceca so far but ofcourse too early to tell One win against Villa away from it You don't have the coach that did that though, there are still big question marks about maresca and Chelsea is a circus, lose a few matches and I wouldn't not be at all shocked if it all falls apart. Are you the 4th strongest squad? I put both Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, and maybe even Newcastle or Villa have as good or better squads than Chelsea. Yeah, if we ignore squad composition and leadership, Chelsea have a lot of raw talent. But in the real world, Chelsea probably have maybe the 7th or 8th best equipped squad in the league? Like I'd take Villa's group in context over Chelsea's any day, even though the talent gap is ginormous. What do you mean ""suddenly so much better""?  They faltered at the end, but they were in the lead around April. They finished 9pts off the top, 7pts off you lot. They don't have to be ""so much better"" to be in a title race, they already were. New start, players are well known with eachother now, new manager = new tactics and strats -> new usage of the players. There is potential. I wouldn't put them aside top 4 (I'm biased) Growing pains are fair but no way that squad isn't stacked, they are one of the best teams in Europe on paper.¬†   You can't be that good and not have a stacked squad. How ? Who has a stronger forward line with the exception of city? Chelsea last season looked decent against Liverpool on opening day. They proceeded to not look decent for the majority of the rest of the season. Lets give them a chance to prove they've stepped up a level first. Chelsea‚Äôs first 11 looked okay against citys pretty random team while at home. And lost 2-0. That was their best possible 11, and their midfield got a lesson from their former player. They were way too shaky defensively for my liking. City cut through them like butter. Half this thread is seemingly people incapable of any thought beyond media narratives from clickbait loving pundits.   It‚Äôs one thing to not have Chelsea in your top 4, that‚Äôs fair enough but people who think it‚Äôs somehow ‚Äúinsane‚Äù have clearly just fallen for the hyperbolic headlines. The bloated squad point is especially stupid, it will not be a 40 man squad by the window ends and a good 15 or so of those players shown in those viral graphics will be sold or loaned out. It‚Äôs not comparable to the Potter season where there was genuinely 30+ first team players who expected to get minutes. Says more about the tactical dinosaur that we could get that close despite the injury crisis and Cole Palmer the only reliable outlet for goals. Btw, I remember when the injury crisis was no excuse for Poch. Now it's an excuse in arguments that, pending better fitness, we will easily achieve top 4. pochettino is better manager than maresca, who almost bottled the championship with leicester last year. also, last season you had thiago silva as a leadership voice in the dressing room and a overperforming cole palmer, who alone must've rescued at least 10 points by himself. this season you solved none of the problems of last year except you got an unproven coach, a more bloated squad, and the other teams around you have improved. Where has this narrative come from you were close to getting top 4? You were never close to being in the race. Also 5 League Titles in a row is pretty rare and has never happened in the English Top Flight. Pep is  ridiculous and City turn into Relentless Winning Machines every Spring, but it does seem likely they'll falter of *eventually.* What team Bang on? He predicted United will finish above Arsenal that season.   Anyone with eyes could tell our run wasn‚Äôt sustainable particularly with the Saliba injury Yeah I‚Äôve also seen other people say that but Chelsea were a one man team with Palmer. I don‚Äôt see them being a one man team and relying on Neto tbh considering he‚Äôs always injured Yeah, approval is useless, you wanna piss off as many people as possible. lol sorry my guy/gal I don't doubt Man United can get third or fourth, or Chelsea to get fourth somehow, I seriously doubt BOTH will finish above Liverpool. (I also doubt Arsenal and City will finish outside the top two) For the title!? Yeah nice one, I maybe would‚Äôve agreed with you if Chelsea didn‚Äôt sack Poch and kept Gallagher while bringing in a good striker (tbf the third thing could still happen and you do have Nkunku)   But Chelsea have imo regressed even from last season where you weren‚Äôt great (aside from the last 3-4 games) while Man Utd have done some good business but it‚Äôs still to be said how good the signings will be  Maybe I‚Äôm biased, but I think Man Utd will finish above Chelsea, but top 4 is very competitive between Man Utd, Newcastle, Spurs and maybe West Ham and Villa in the mix too  imo Chelsea would be in that race if they did the things I mentioned in my first paragraph. Yeah outside of Top 4 with 3 points away from Villa. He has Chelsea outside of Top 6. the fact you think thats a good bench when you can look at citys or arsenal's.. good luck man. liverpool has to win the league then with such an insane bench. I would have said Yoro but the injury Looks like Spurs 2.0 I'm 100% with you. The Liver bird is far better looking on the kit. I actually prefer it overall to the other crest, which is far too busy and associate it with a largely unsuccessful period in the club. [nope, it was the owners decision](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/liverpool-fc-use-liver-bird-across-digital-platforms) Nah the kit's definitely benefited from that switch, and even more so in person because it's embroidered rather than just a stick on patch. Totally disagree. They used the Liver bird long before that last crest existed, so it's hardly just a new trend. The Liver bird is far more simple, effective and clean looking, imo It looks way better on the kit. They won‚Äôt go back to the 2002 badge. I‚Äôve just made a comment above with a small explanation as to why, just because I see a lot of comments not knowing the reason why it was changed in the first place. > It was always decide that once justice was given, we would return to the Liver bird.  No it wasnt. What are you on about? Given Gary's track record with predictions, this can only be good for Lopetegui Kane scored 36 goals for Bayern last season but his real impact was his curse lol Its a bold prediction though. Pretty sure Neto has less career goals than Antony and missed 50% of the games he could have played for Wolves. We finished at 12th actually I mean the squad harmony is in shambles They never mentioned if the impact was positive¬† I guess you can read it as an impact on the teams form or impact in terms of player performance, might be more of a whose the best signing going to be. We were top 6 last season I mean Jamie has Neto as an impact signing and he didn't even put Chelsea in the top 6 lmao If the rest of the squad sucks it could happen. But agreed, odd choice To be fair though it doesn‚Äôt say it would need to be a positive impact either. So wasting ¬£60 mill on a striker who doesn‚Äôt score and managing to drop them down into the bottom half would also be a big impact. he hates us lol Nah he does want them to win for a bunch of reasons. This city dominance is bad for his legacy and I think be believes the state owned stuff is really bad for the short although hed happily have it at United if it meant trophies again lol.  I think he also just wants a strong Arsenal because that's what he came through against. Like I would've much rather won our league title against a 2nd place United side, that's honestly how I always pictured us winning it anyway, Neville in his dream probably would rather see United finish 1st over a good Liverpool and Arsenal team well he doesnt want city so what else he going to do > I'm more optimistic than he is, but I can see why he'd expect Liverpool to have a tough first year after Klopp. It's big shoes to fill, and they haven't signed any players yet. >  >   We were starting from a place of having clearly one of the three best squads in the league though, so lack of signings doesn't have as much of an impact as it does on, say, United or Spurs. It's been a fairly quiet summer for most of the top sides anyway - City and Arsenal haven't made much movement either. City have signed Savinho, but lost Alvarez. Arsenal upgraded at left back, but haven't done anything else yet. They probably get Merino over the line, but until they've done that I don't see why that would count for them given that we could still make signings too.  > It's also better than the recent pre-Klopp average. Between 09/10 and 15/16 (Klopp's first year when they came 8th) they only came 6th, 7th, and 8th, except for the infamous Gerrard slip year when they came 2nd under Brendan Rodgers, so he thinks the club at least is left better than before Klopp came in.  This is a nonsense way to look at completely different teams. Those teams were a world away from the current one with Gomez being the only continuity.   > If things stay as they are transfer wise, the question is essentially how many places was Klopp's direct benefit on the team worth, and he's saying ~3, with maybe a little how much of an impact does standing still have when rivals sign players.  It's more like how many points. If you think Klopp was worth 20+ points to a team with world class players littered throughout, then fair enough, I just don't agree. He's a brilliant manager and one of our best ever, but I'd be stunned if this team finished below 70 points without a massive injury crisis. Nothing crazy, it's not impossible he has a great season, I just think from an entire league of players, picking someone who is not a guaranteed starter whose side just bought *another* player who plays in his most likely position for a lot of money could be seen as a strange shout. That's definitely not the 'batshit prediction' part lol  Probably moreso Chelsea and United both in top 4 I understand your point completely, it's fair, but one thing I'll say about the massive swing is that points totals are very inconsistent, and Man United and Chelsea could feasibly finish on 5-8 points more each and get 3rd and 4th, and Liverpool's points totals have been arguably the most inconsistent in the league in recent years. From 2019/20 to 20/21 they dropped *30* points, then gained back 23, then dropped 25 points, then gained back 15 points. They've finished on 67 and 69 points very recently. All under Klopp who was their fuckin' god. Them having an off season has plenty of precedent even before taking into account the new manager and the lack of transfers.  If Chelsea and Man United were to finish in the late 60s-early 70s with modest gains over last season, I don't think it's that crazy to think the other teams could finish lower, considering last season they all ranged from 60-68 points, in the same zone as Chelsea and Man United.  I'll reiterate that I don't personally agree that they'll do it and I predicted Liverpool to come 3rd and then really struggled with 4th, I just don't think it's *that* crazy, because I don't think any of those 6 teams really stand out that much. Yeah exactly Literally finished 3rd in 22/23 champ It would be an exceptional season, but I think you could say the same for everyone else going for Champions League except maybe Liverpool, who came 3rd last year with Klopp, and that was seen as overachieving according to Liverpool fans, and they haven't improved their squad at all under a new manager who's only managed in the Eredivisie.  Newcastle came 7th, level with Man United, haven't finished 3rd since 2003. Villa came 4th last season, this year have Champions League to contend with, lost Luiz, would do very well to match 4th let alone come 3rd, which they haven't got since 1993. Chelsea are a total shitshow behind the scenes and very confusing on the pitch, came 6th last season. Spurs came 5th and haven't looked great since the start of last season.  I think with the exception of Liverpool, purely because of recent history rather than more logical current expectations, you could argue it's crazy to predict any of those teams to come 3rd. If they keep Martinez + De Ligt fit and Shaw plays most of the season, then they'd be primed to take 3rd if Liverpool have a rough adaptation year. >United have been so poor for 18 months now  Nah, United the back end of 22/23 were okay when people were fit. United 23/24 never had anyone fit.   >8th last year was a generous placement for their actual level of play,  Meh, with the level of talent in the squad United can probably give you in or around that season 24 out of 25 times with the xG stats looking like that. The xGA looks bad because of the volume of shots, and it looked grim to watch too, but United loading the box and being largely prepared for those shots meant in practice they were less meaningful than you'd think.  I'll put it this way, Onana didn't have to have an elite season whatsoever for United to vastly overperform their xGA, he was only +2 for the season, but the PSxG was 59, compared to an xGA of 74.76.   So United were huge statistical outliers in terms of the quality of shot the opposition was actually producing, and I don't think that's a coincidence. They placed a huge emphasis on box defending.  All of this said, I do not have them finishing 3rd. I think they'd do well for 4th given how good Liverpool and Villa are. They finished 3rd just the season before. Last season, United had the most injuries in the PL and couldn't field 4 defenders for a significant amount of games. Meanwhile, United are still the only team to beat City in 2024 in a competitive game (i.e. the FA cup final) in regular time (with Real being the only other team to beat City after penalties). City were able to field their best team, while United couldn't, but at least they had 4 defenders in their starting eleven again at that time. So, United have the potential to beat the best and their first two games (Community shield and the PL opener) looked pretty promising. If they have less injury problems, I can see them having a similar season as in 2022/23 (when they beat City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Barca, ...) with a top 4 finish and deep cup runs. Mazraoui and de ligt are game changers though, massive lift to the floor of the club. 3rd is definitely achieveavle if those two stay fit. They won‚Äôt lose to smaller teams if they play I assume one to watch is usually said in a positive sense. Like, here's someone I think will surprise people and do really well I mean we've been here before haven't we? New manager at Chelsea with promises of long term projects. There are growing pains that come with implementing a new system and bedding in new players, building that chemistry. Chelsea brass have not shown the patience to fight through those bleak periods and stick with the manager. Poch even showed the improvement in the second half and had the young team playing like a top 4 side in the second half, in spite of the injuries.  I guess the Pep protege part is new but I mean the soccer world is full of Pep proteges already, so even that's not particularly new. I am once again begging people to read the discussion that's already happened on this thread about this subject.   >Nothing crazy, it's not impossible he has a great season, I just think from an entire league of players, picking someone who is not a guaranteed starter whose side just bought another player who plays in his most likely position for a lot of money could be seen as a strange shout.  I meant I can understand someone saying it's batshit because it's kind of a weird player to go for as your one to watch, even if he ends up having a good season, which is very possible. Also you can't fuckin' judge someone off some preseason games, and you can't judge someone who doesn't support them for not watching Arsenal's preseason games. The lad has played 92 minutes of Prem football, a 50 minute appearance, and two 21 minute appearances, and I have actually watched all of those. I didn't even give my opinion on what he's like as a player, because I don't have one, because I'm not going to go back and watch some old *friendlies* to try and get a judgement on a player. Even if I did, my opinion on him would be worthless, because they're friendlies.   It just struck me as odd to go for a defender who has been out for a year who isn't guaranteed to start as your player to watch, in a league full of interesting potential answers to that question. You can't genuinely think that's a crazy take It's really not Name me a team other than Liverpool that I couldn't argue is a batshit choice to come top 4 for very similar reasons.  Villa = Finished on 68 points, lost Luiz, now have Champions League to contend with, haven't finished 3rd since 1993, first time in the top 4 since '96.  Spurs = Are Spurs. Finished on 66 points, suspect defence, only got Champions League once in the last 5 years.   Chelsea = Finished on 63 points. Batshit insane behind the scenes, most bloated squad we've ever seen, nobody knows their best line up, shocked everyone with their amazing 2nd half of the season and still only beat United by 3 points  Newcastle = 60 points, same as Man United, not finished 3rd since 2003, felt lucky to get to 60 points last year, looked poor against Southampton  Someone is going to finish 3rd and 4th. I don't think it'll be those 2, maybe one, but choosing them is no more crazy than any of the other options in my opinion. Liverpool changed their manager. Their window looks dull. Is it too wild to say Liverpool won't make Top 4?  Chelsea Top 4 is wild given but I don't think saying Liverpool not Top 4 is even remotely wild. People who think Liverpool for sure make Top 4 after their manager left and no net new signings are in fact the wild ones. [deleted] ""Our fans"" it was meant to be satire but fuck me right? New staff. Extra games can contribute too you know You are free to believe what you want I guess, but I dont see it. We have massively strengthened over the summer and were already a better team before that anyway. Not only with all the signings we made but also getting Mings / Buendia back, and Kamara by Christmas. You can mate, make sure to tag me when we are in CL again and Newcastle finish 8th. Gary was basing his LFC  take on ""historical evidence"". That being his trauma of SAF leaving and what happened to United.   Neville only knows what he knows. There is a video on Sky YouTube where they did a similar rating for the table. This was before MNF. And one of them even suggested slot wouldn‚Äôt make it to the end of the season, despite only hearing of the man a couple weeks ago. It‚Äôs just rage bait The key pieces of the squad are aging though. VVD is 33 and Salah is 32, in particular. Not that wild to expect they don‚Äôt produce at peak levels at this point (and VVD, while definitely not bad, hasn‚Äôt looked quite as WC as he did at his peak). This was a shocking thing to realize Fingers crossed we don't have Pickford taking Van Dijk out for the season then.   Even in a season where we played Henderson, Fabinho, Rhys Williams, and Nat Phillips in defence for massive stretches, we still only finished 5 points off your lot and, again, still in the top 3. You finished 22 points behind us last season. How exactly are you bridging that 22 point gap I can easily see us finishing 3rd idk why people are sleeping Trust me. It can happen Not having Klopp could easily lose you 20 points though.. Positive goal difference now though, there's no stopping us üî• Think you‚Äôre underestimating us a bit with 1 shit player and 2 mid players and mcallister playing out of position yeah.. 1 injury to vvd or trent and jotta plays as many games as shaw per season - i m not praying on him getting injured its just a fact sadly - that leaves just salah to carry the goalscoring and you re gonna start hearing the saudi rumours again in Jan about him.. I mean, there should be added context to those United stats last season. We suffered our worst injury crisis in a while with most of those injuries concentrated in our defense even. This season, it is likely we will have fewer injuries, and we also now have some depth in most positions, especially defense.    If you consider that Liverpool were probably more motivated to make Klopp‚Äôs last season count and maybe played better than expected, then it‚Äôs not too much of a stretch to expect United to improve and Liverpool to regress.   Anyone is always going to look at the same situation and have their own personal biased perspective. But, while I‚Äôm a bit skeptical myself, I think it‚Äôs not an implausible outcome (and expectation) that United get into top four at the expense of Liverpool. Yeah i agree with all of this, I didn't expect Liverpool to win the league, just saying we've all quickly forgot that they were in contention, even if getting results better than performances.   From reading, some Liverpool fans are pessimistic, thinking the midfield isn't strong enough. From the outside, I think it's so dependant on no injuries, because if Elliot, Szoboszlai and Jones stay fit then I think you'll remain up there. It's easy to think a midfield is weak when key players are out then return not the same, when you just need them to regain the form.   At United, so many wrote off Casemiro and he was adamant, he's not ready to retire, it's probably insulting to him. Pundits think he's lost weight and in a less exposed system he might regain form again.   Liverpool's midfield even during the win every game period was never spectacular, it was pretty workmanlike, just physical high energy. And those young players can do that. I think it will be Arsenal, City, Liverpool, then maybe Newcastle again. mainoo alone is better than liverpools and chelsea's entire midfields combined Same argument can be made for United being that many points behind last season then? You do know how many Defensive partners United had? 6th choice Jonny Evans ended up having 30 appearance and Casemiro played lots of games at CB. Or does or ""merit"" logic only apply for Liverpool? Forget about the ifs and buts. I am talking about what exactly happened. It has happened in reality twice in last 4 seasons and it can obviously happen again especially with Klopp gone. I think they're saying Liverpool have a weaker squad and worse manager relative to Liverpool last season, not to Chelsea this season, whereas Chelsea have improved their own squad I disagree with his take but he's comparing Liverpool to Liverpool last season and Chelsea to Chelsea last season, not Liverpool to Chelsea. I don't think his reasoning is incorrect at all. Just think his outcome won't be close to reality. The floor is yours, explain how you believe that Liverpool's squad has improved and Chelsea's has got worse.  Explain. I agree, it's not just Liverpool fan bias, I support Man United and there is no way Man United AND Chelsea finish above Liverpool. Not a chance. It's not just Maresca's inexperience but having to deal with a huge squad, it took Pochettino until April to gain any consistency and that's with Palmer's ridiculous output, which this  possession system will suppress. >based on what? we've lost players that never played    VVD, Robertson, and Salah are ageing another year  >pochettino is better than maresca too   Very debatable  >how do you even know this, its been 1 game where you lost at home, to a city team who barely lifted a finger   Because his system better suits the personnel we have   >you're not making up a 20+ point deficit without some freakish act of god.  Liverpool overperformed last season, and Chelsea underperformed   >you clowns said the same shit last year and then weren't in the same half of the table as us for 90% of the season. you got thoroughly humiliated by a bunch of kids who had barely played senior football. stop thinking about us.  The fact that we weren't in the same half of the table as you guys last season despite possessing a squad that was very much capable of being there just sums up how much we underperformed, and I don't even have to get into the cup final. This season, tho you won't have Klopp to carry you, and we won't have Poch dragging us down. Also, nobody is thinking about Liverpool. He's just giving an accurate assessment ü§∑ you could also finish 11th, which is where you were for most of last season. Lavia, Nkunku, Fofana, Chilwell and James were basically unavailable all season. Last season 4/5 of those would have started every game they were available.  Colwill and Cucurella were both out for long stretches as well. Did you miss our weekly injury crisis lol? It was all anyone ever talked about >That was because poch ball had Palmer cooking.  At the expense of multiple other players coincidentally hitting their worst form in years, if not ever. We drew. You‚Äôd have had 2 more points and we‚Äôd have 1 less point. Good maths. People keep saying it's a circus, but it's not, it's headlines that this sub eats up. The first team and Maresca have been doing what they're supposed and all 1000 extra players are training somewhere else. It's kind of the opposite of what we saw under Potter. I know everyone here thinks, ""ENZO WILL BLOW UP THE DRESSING ROOM, EVERYONE WILL BE UPSET ABOUT CONOR!"" but it's not really true for real life, only Reddit.  And Poch started awfully, truly terrible stuff for the first two months and Palmer was revealed to be a God. One of the big reasons Poch is gone was because there was a lot of doubt Palmer could bail us out another season in a row while not accepting he needed extra coaches to help. Maresca has done the exact opposite and created a set up much closer to what Pep does. How on earth does Man United, Tottenham and, Newcastle and Villa have better squad than us? This sub has been overrun by hiveminds whoring for some karma. No offence but I doubt you watch much premier league football and it shows Yes, easily. Please, list the 8 teams you think are better equipped than us. It‚Äôs fine that we have question marks, it‚Äôs true there are many hanging over us. That‚Äôs true of all the teams around us but we also have some top talent in the team Villa won't even be in top 4 contention. Their starters have 8 midweek games to play, while Chelsea can heavily rotate on Thursdays for our 6. You could see how much CL fucked up Newcastle's league season, and it was 2 games less than Villa will have to play. Like you said, they faltered. So they have to be better than they were to get close to City. We havent done shit in the transfer window, we‚Äôll see the kids again in april and wonder yet again for what seems like the millionth time whether our lack of signings cost us a title Well if you count strength in numbers then Chelsea Arsenal   Seems like y‚Äôall don‚Äôt watch matches. Tbf we wouldn‚Äôt be playing all of Caicedo/Enzo/Lavia at once often that was likely a city thing and play Nkunku/Felix in the role Enzo occupied, we created some good chances and if we had an actual attacking mid where Enzo was could have capitalized. Definitely wasn‚Äôt a great performance but honestly better then I was expecting prior to the game with Jackson and Palmer only playing 45 minutes of preseason Our best possible Xl minus James(who would've clamped Doku like last time), Enzo playing as a 10, Nkunku playing out wide, and a new manager who's trying to implement a completely different system  Yet, we still more than held our own, and the likes of KDB and Silva were made to look irrelevant by a former city youth player and kid in Lavia ü§∑ A largely fully fit squad absolutely should. I think even Poch would have done with Nkunku and Lavia fit. üò∑üò∑ Would rather an unproven coach who MIGHT turn out to be something than someone who we know isn't it.  The game has passed Poch by everybit as much as it has Jose, it just doesn't get the same attention because he wasn't THAT good in the first place. Technically speaking, the 6 point swing had we beat you guys at The Bridge would have seen us there. their fans are genuinely brain dead. they've spent the vast majority of the last 2 seasons sitting in 11th, but they think they're going to waltz to top 4.   it's easy to rack up points at the end of a season where you have literally nothing to play for. it doesn't mean you're a good team or that it automatically carries over. I'd be stunned if they finish higher than 6th. City have the easiest last 10 games, so they're guaranteed 10 straight wins, I think they'll do it again sadly and we'll finally win when pep goes >particularly with the Saliba injury  People seriously underestimate Saliba. Even Fantasy has Gabriel with better stats when it should be the other way around > Anyone with eyes could tell our run wasn‚Äôt sustainable   Tell that to the Arsenal fans who abused him for months, and he revised his predictions to say United would finish below and Arsenal fans still lost their shit.  He now just makes his life easier says Arsenal will be the best team ever so he doesn‚Äôt have to talk about them too much. I have the strange ability to type something completely different from what I was thinking and not notice. I could've sworn I said City and Arsenal there, but I guess not lol. Chelsea, who weren't great but over the course of a year did better than united in the league, and have also since strengthened their squad, think you might be smoking some of Gary's crack.  If the likes of Lavia & Nkunku can remain fit, we will comfortably finish in the top four, if there's a club I'm confident that will miss out on top four, it's united. 5 points away from Villa. And only 3 points ahead of Newcastle in 7th. So if you really wanna go by points they were closer missing out on top 6 than making top 4 Didn‚Äôt say it was insane, but perfectly serviceable. Spurs chicken looks like a temu liverbird It is the crest used from the era of shankly till 1987, it is more simple but at least they die Not use the Juventus approach to something more simplistic I dunno, it looks cheaper to me when I see it on TV. And I know I'm not the only one.  I was always a fan of Liverpool 2005 - 2008 kits with Adidas and Carlsberg sponsorship - I cannot imagine how ruined they'd be if there was a bird instead of full badge on them... Okay, I guess me, a Scouser who worked with the HFSG (Not HJC) and whose parents both attended the game and have worked separately alongside HJC & HFSG, is wrong. I guess the consultancy group who worked with LFC in 1998 to design the badge and then the same group who further changed it in 2013 are also wrong.  No worries mate, enjoy your night. Lol Oh of course, pretty sure most of the predictions are just for engagement and controversy. Who told you that? You're missing the point. Carragher predicts Neto is going to be the impact signing of the season, while also saying chelsea will drop from top 6 to outside the top 7. Neto as impact signing is maybe the worst take on this list yeah. Either that, or one of Chelsea 4th or Liverpool 5th. I also think Neville has been quite positive about Arsenal since the last season. I do think he may actually believe we could win this season, but also think it has a bit to do with not wanting City to win to retain his legacy as you said. i think a lot of people wanted Arsenal to win last year (me included) becaues the league becomes boring when City just wins every year.  Some for sure felt like if someones gonna win it, might as well be city, and make Arsenal fans miserable lol, but if I could've chosen i'd have picked Arsenal over City. 1) I agree, that's why I'm more optimistic.  2) Yes, I said that the club is in a better state than it was pre-Klopp, so I agree there too...  3) It could be a lot less than 20 points being the difference between being 3rd and 5th, and you have to remember (quite obviously) the team is now 1 year older. For the core of the team, that makes injuries more likely, same with the natural drop off.   Like I said, I think Liverpool will do better than that, but I think it's complacent to just assume Liverpool are going to walk top four. I think of all of our lbs he has the best chance of consistently starting. Yeah ask any Arsenal fan about Timber and he's easily one of the most exciting players we're about to see this season. Oh yes I totally agree, it's very possible for Liverpool to have a huge points drop from last season, it's happened before under Klopp and may even be likely now with his absence.   However that PLUS the others like Spurs, Newcastle and Villa who have settled managers & teams also failing while a manager that saved his job with the FA Cup and the most absurd team in the league somehow beating all of the above...yeah that's just too many chips to fall exactly how Neville would want them. Yeah so over a year ago, as I said, and the drop off in performance level has been stark. For example, Rashford scored 30 goals that season and Casemiro was far better than his current self, both are still in the squad today producing at a significantly lower level If ifs and buts were candy and nuts I disagree, I have them 5th/6th this year at best. They‚Äôre nowhere near City or Arsenal and they aren‚Äôt a better team than Liverpool, Spurs, Newcastle, or Villa. They improved their back line, but they struggled scoring last year (8th highest in the Prem), not conceding (4th lowest GA in the Prem). Zirkzee should help (as we saw this weekend), but I don‚Äôt expect it to move the needle to push them top 4 personally Too many if xGA, PSxG, etc are flawed metrics for a number of reasons. Based on xG and xGA as a baseline, they would have [finished 12th in 23-24](https://www.90min.com/posts/the-2023-24-premier-league-table-based-on-xg) Mazraoui a game changer? Lol Let‚Äôs wait until we actually see De Ligt play I disagree, but we‚Äôll see what happens, still way too early in the season to gauge impact of signings for any club I suppose. But I still feel it could apply. But hey, one to watch in case he crashes and burns too ü§∑ !RemindMe 7 months >I don't think it'll be those 2, maybe one  Crazy how you wrote all that just to turn around and agree with me. Like I said, United 3rd and Chelsea 4th is batshit. Could either one of them squeak in? Maybe, there are so many variables throughout the season, but imo having both of them make top 4 would be crazy. > Is it too wild to say Liverpool won't make Top 4?  Yeah, a bit, unless you think the drop off will be 20+ points. City signed Savinho but lost Alvarez, Arsenal have only signed a left back, it's not like the other top teams have signed loads of players. Liverpool will have a midfield that's actually played together and a team that is largely settled.   We don't have many holes in the squad and, aside from Zubimendi, there's no clear upgrade at the position we have the biggest need. I would tbh It was an 8 point gap two years ago (when our wheels completely fell off) versus a 22 point gap last year, so yes I would be quite surprised. You got me there, but you/the fans can‚Äôt be crying over a pundit who is biased towards another team. Playstyle But last season they got ruined by injuries. Before that they looked quite good. If they can close the Guehi deal then they‚Äôll look really good imo. lol neither of us are getting CL this season, much like we did last season, you should enjoy the group stage (and maybe a single Ro16 tie as you'll have a much easier group draw so might scrape through) cause after that, you'll be lucky to have Conference League! CL again, zero chance. Neville picks were more like his wishes rather than realistic predictions, but nothing wrong with that. It would be mundane if everyone picked the same things do you have a link for this video? Cant find it Salah and VVD seem to be doing pretty good You do realise we start at the same amount of points at the beginning of the season? We bridged an even bigger gap 2 seasons ago. You were 34 pts ahead 3 seasons ago. When you won during covid, we also bridged a similar gap to finish ahead of you in 21. +12 and -11 makes up the gap.. hardly improbable.. We'll win a few more games and you'll lose a few more, simple Well see ""easily"" is insanity lol - I strongly doubt we touch the top 3, but I think it's pretty likely we come 4th for several reasons.  Chelsea looked decent against City, but with a new manager and that many players at the club, I think they have another messy season before things start to pick up.  Villa, as good as they are, I just don't see their squad being able to handle the added fixtures that the Champions league will bring (similar to Brighton and Newcastle from last season, wouldn't be surprised if we see a lot of injuries too).  Tottenham - bottlers (jokes aside, I just don't see them doing better than some of the other teams in the race and their prosperity seems very dependent on how well Solanke hits the ground running, but he is admittedly a great signing for them)  Newcastle - this is the only team I see us losing out on top 5 to, with the reduced burden of Europe and the sheer talent in their squad, they can very well finish above us if they don't get hit by injuries too hard  And above all else, I think we've made some good signings and, most importantly, we finally have some depth, so injuries won't debilitate us the same way they did last season. I also think this is gonna be a breakout season for Kobbie and Garnacho (maybe even Amad but I strongly doubt it). It's also worth looking at the TYPE of injuries we've been hit by recently  - many weren't recurring (Martinez' freak leg breaks and Yoro's recent break being examples), and it's just very unlikely we'll see something at that level again.  That being said, it's still ETH at the helm, so who knows. Easily see United 3rd is a stretch. Good signing should put United as favourites for 4th, but that team has a lot to prove that they can catch Liverpool, who were title challengers until April and lead the league most any team.   It's not impossible that United finish 3rd, of course, but definitely not favourites for it. Can‚Äôt compare 35 year olds at united in 2014 to Liverpools current young squad tho If you replace him with a dinosaur like Moyes, sure. He was pretty fucking jaded last season though and has been for a bit.   I know there's a lot of panic online about our lack of signings but our squad is pretty fucking good. Slot was brought in with his ability to develop players and tactical adaptability as key points.   It's hard to tell how a season plays out but Slots style could theoretically be more sustainable throughout a season. Meaning less injuries and a less noticeable mid/late season slump. You look good but it‚Äôs early and united have a way of unraveling the last 10 years. underlying numbers put u four or five places lower than 8th, and u dont look too improved. that fa cup win papers over the cracks for ten hag. truth is he cooked a below midtable performance last season (yes, with injuries, but many other clubs have had crises, like 20/21 liverpool who finished 3rd). i genuinely don't think ten hag has what it takes and he can beat liverpool and city with the same old methods ole used of countering and surrendering control. Every team at the top of the table struggled with injuries last year, United were probably the worst-affected but not by as much as is being made out.  The Liverpool players will be more motivated this season than last. It would have been nice to give Klopp a good send off, but that isn't going to motivate the players more than playing for their place in the team under a completely new manager who might not fancy them. Aa a fan, before last season, I thought United would challenge for the league, now I think Ten Tag won't ever come good. We don't score goals under him, despite Bruno's 'best in Europe' creation stats, despite Ganarcho's relentless energy that to me makes him above many other young wingers, despite Rashford being in the form of his life for 4 months, despite buying a forward with the energy and modesty and pace and physicality to press from the front, despite buying a ball playing keeper who Ten Hag has worked with before. If people think no consistent backline means the whole attack suffers to the degree we spent all season with a negative goal difference then ok but Ten Hag has everything to prove for me, I think there's more chance of him being sacked than United getting third, for me.   The Fulham game was a bit different as United don't usually create a number of chances, clear ones. But still just one goal. A late winner by a teenager, we've seen that before with Hannibal (not a winner though)  I can see Slot offering a boost to the Liverpool players tired by Klopp's rhetoric honestly, just something different. He admitted at Dortmund by the last season it's hard to find new ways to say the same things. Why get all up in your feelings and lie like that? > Same argument can be made for United being that many points behind last season then?  You could try to make that argument but I don't think it explains a 22 point difference between the two sides. United's injury free 3rd place finish from the year before was still 7 points off of what Liverpool achieved last season.  > 6th choice Jonny Evans ended up having 30 appearance and Casemiro played lots of games at CB.  Evans only had 23 appearances in the league, and only started 15 of those games. Even then, most united fans said Evans had a very solid season, Magurie too for that matter. Even Kambwalla was applauded for his performance against Liverpool and Old Trafford. And Casemiro only played like 5 or 6 games at CB. I'm not sure I'd call that lots, though his performances were woeful to be fair.  Granted, you'd pick Martinez and Varane every time if they were available but I think United fans are completely exaggerating how much the injuries impacted your season. And your stats would suggest as much. Despite the injuries to your defense you only conceded 58 goals, which is less than Newcastle, Chelsea, Spurs and Villa, who all finished above you.  Your real problem was a midfield that couldn't control games and a toothless attack. You only scored  57 goals, which is at least 20 goals less than each of the teams I previously mentioned, and 30 goals less than Liverpool, who were misfiring in front of goal last season. That's a staggering amount of goals to be off the pace, and Luke Shaw and Martinez being back from injury isn't going to make up the difference. thank you we underperformed our xg by 10 last season, so we actually have room to get better.   your squad has no business being anywhere close to ours. bunch of overrated bums. only player that approaches world class is palmer.   pochettino is a level above maresca. no one apart from extremely delusional chelsea fans would even think of arguing this. mad how you've got such an incredible squad yet spent the entire season in 12th. it's not just the manager kid.   we have zero idea of what this chelsea team does under pressure. they coasted at the end of the season with zero eyes or pressure on them. if they by some miracle find themselves in a top 4 race, they'll crumble like they did in the league cup final.   finished club by every metric. and you deserve it. He‚Äôs a Villa fan Why include James and Chillwell, they are always constantly injured. At this point it's a given they will miss 30% of the games at least.   We won't be sure how Fofana will be after 2 years of injuries. That said I think season will start bad for Chelsea and they will pick up later. They have to many good attacking players. The only thing that would worry me is that Maresca hasn't shown that he is capable of organizing a solid defense.   Plus Newcastle, a healthy United, Spurs and a wildcard in Brighton and West Ham will all complete for the top 8-9 positions.   Top 3: should be locked for City Arsenal (imo champions this year) and Liverpool.  4-8: United, Chelsea, spurs, Newcastle with West Ham and Brighton lurking. and he didn't start cooking until close to winter. We started the season awful lmao. Their worst form in years? Jackson had his best season, Caicedo according to chelsea fans was good aside from the goal conceding mistakes every few games, Gallagher was solid, Chelsea fans seem very happy with their reece james replacement, and overall they actually scored a lot more than the previous season. Two of their promising players in Nkuku and Lavia were injured all season  Ngl, the only ones hitting bad form were Enzo (frankly he's kind meh compared to Chelsea's other midfielders), Sterling (washed anyway), and maybe one of the CBs who I don't know?  All in all, Poch had quite a few players looking decent compared to what they have previously Talking about the first game champ Home game The fact you have all those 1000 extra players is an issue I'm itself and forcing out academy lads who don't want to leave is weird behaviour especially when they have actually performed and care about the club. There is no way in which you slice it that this ownership has done a good job, to spend over a billion and end up with what you have is criminal behaviour.  The jury is still out on maresca, one thing trying to be pep and another thing actually doing it, Leicester fans weren't even that hot on him either, the board wanted someone they can easily control and here he is, Chelsea are not a well run football club. Believe it or not, some people have opinions. If we took the starting XI of every team I listed and compared it to Chelsea, I would take majority of the other team‚Äôs players. I rate Haaland, Watkins, Isak, Jesus, Hoijlund way more than Jackson. The only players I would take most of the time are Palmer, James, and Nkunku. Everybody else in the Chelsea squad basically doesn‚Äôt get into the other teams barring a few exceptions. That‚Äôs just my opinion. Yeah but no one else in the PL has you as 4th strongest squad either, you‚Äôve gone for the quantity over quality approach, I doubt many other top 4 chasers would want to swap squads with you Yeah I don‚Äôt really watch that much. No where near what I do with LaLiga. I catch a few games every week mostly from mid table sides cuz they‚Äôre more fun I guess. I mean alright. I see it differently but I‚Äôm also not a Chelsea fan or follow premier league too closely. If you say so I guess. But everything I see or watch online says that Maresca isn‚Äôt that guy, the squad is overloaded and not talented enough yet, and everybody is super young and inexperienced. Easily the 4th best squad? That's crazy talk. Selling Gallagher and signing Neto bumps Chelsea into 4th? Not to me it doesn't, especially after the signings United made Well 8 teams above you would put you 9th, so there's that, but I'd say City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Villa, United, Newcastle and maybe Spurs.   I just think there's more leadership, better composition with clearer roles and a more defined project in terms of the players suiting the manager.   I will say, that's not really taking injuries into account, which is where Chelsea's massive squad turns into more of an advantage. Chelsea's 4th and 5th choice options are exceptional, it's just that doesn't matter that much unless there's an injury crisis. Assuming a normal amount of injuries for everyone, I'd have those 6, maybe 7, above Chelsea. Meh, Villa have enough of a squad to rotate to not crucify their starters. Newcastle got fucked by injuries, and yeah more games = bigger risk of injury, but idk if that happens to Villa.   If they do get fucked with injuries then sure, they won't be in top 4 contention, but if they don't they'll be there or there abouts. They drew to Luton, lost to Everton, drew to Chelsea, drew to United twice - don't have to be that much better to have picked up an extra 9 points from those 5 games alone. Because we had a brand new midfield and had a massive injury list. No reason we can't have as good a season this year. Klopp is obviously a huge loss but a fresh manager isn't always a bad thing, especially as the foundation he has been given seem really good. [deleted] We had a freak run of injuries last season that almost never happens.   We have 2 competent players for each position across the whole squad and 4 world class players who start in our main XI.   Our players are better suited to Slot‚Äôs style, formation and tactics vs Klopp‚Äôs style and formation and tactics and we finished 14 points ahead of Villa, 16 ahead of Spurs, 19 ahead of Chelsea and 22 ahead of United. And all of a sudden, we‚Äôre just going to concede 15+ point swing those teams we than we have more favorable reasons to win games vs those teams? Nah Silva got player of the match. What a moronic take. Lavia was your best player. Makes sense he was from our academy. Same with Cole. But Cole was anonymous yesterday. But that was in September. Season could play out completely differently.  With about 10 games to go you were nearly 20 points off 4th place. Winning a lot of games towards the end of the season when us and Spurs had already wrapped up 4th and 5th.   Admittedly you did look good at the end and I'd be worried if Poch was still there, but with another summer of upheaval I can't see it. Nah he just has some absolute horrendous takes about us  [Case in point](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/tskb9n/neville_if_mikel_gets_arsenal_to_4th_if_he_was/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Same, no worries. I‚Äôll agree with your first point  However, it‚Äôs hard to agree with you when you got rid of Gallagher while also sacking Poch, because that‚Äôs why Chelsea were better than Man Utd last season. I highly doubt that Chelsea will get top 4 with an inexperienced manager, and the fitness of Lavia and Nkunku is an ‚Äòif‚Äô. Palmer can only carry yous so much.  I think you‚Äôre only saying your last sentence because of my flair, nice one, you‚Äôre not even backing up why you‚Äôre confident that Man Utd will miss out on top four, if you gave a few good reasons maybe I‚Äôll understand, but instead you‚Äôre just saying that ‚Äòuhh Chelsea were better than Utd last year so Utd will certainly miss out on top four‚Äô  >>since strengthening the squad  Man Utd have also strengthened their squad with a good balance of experience and potential talent, while Chelsea have signed another bunch of unproven wonderkids and Pedro Neto The fuck does that matter. Neto is an impact signing but Chelsea finish lower than they did last season? Reddit users the manager  https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1exo11g/fabrizio_romano_maresca_i_am_not_working_with_42/?ref=share&ref_source=link I replied the wrong message Liverpool 5th wouldn‚Äôt be the wildest prediction if he‚Äôs predicting that the new manager doesn‚Äôt land on his feet.  Kind of goes out the window when he chooses Slot as a manager to watch üòÇ. Yeah watch him drop two places? Why would that be? Palmer was probably the impact signing last season and chelsea didn't break into top 4. Maybe ""impact signing"" just means a new player that makes the team gel more. The worst take on this list is Carragher not having Newcastle in the top 7 Why? There have been 4 maybe 5 players you'd expect to have a big impact signed by PL teams this season. If Neto can avoid injury and reproduce last season's performance, he'll have a good chance to be signing of the season. You don't rate Calafiori to lock that in once he adjusts? (If he adjusts well and fast enough)  Or do you envision Calafiori as a CB like his role at Bologna I think it was? Timber is Whites backup though.. Why when people talk about how bad we were last season do they never acknowledge that our team was absolutely ravaged by injuries? We had like 10 players injured almost the whole season, we eventually reached a casemiro evans cb partnership at some point I believe meaning maguire, varane, martinez, and lindelof were all out. Or maybe lindelof was playing LB cause shaw and malacia were both out. Martinez missed the whole season. I don't even need to mention martial, right? Who's now been replaced by Zirzkee. Just a vast amount of injuries. Villa fans are never escaping the allegations Yes, a drop off due to an injury crisis and a Casemiro that looks 100x better this- than last season. [deleted] They easily have the worst front four in the top 8, despite Bruno being great. The rest of their midfield is meh as well (big fan of Mainoo for his age), although some other top teams are pretty average there too.  Quality wise I don't mind the defense, but they also have to perform.   Shocking, shocking display in league and Europe last season. I need to see more, before i put them for top 4. I think Shaw is so important for their attack. I know it's a fool's expectation that he's fit but we're going for a hopeful outlook then that's a fit Shaw and therefore a Rashford who goes back to being really good. No more AWB dragging them down on the other side now either.  The big question is, how many of Diallo/Garnacho/Hojlund/Zirkzee shine? If it's zero, they're in trouble. If it's at least 2, they've got something good going. They're also still sniffing around Toney. It's hard to see them higher than 5th.  Liverpool are hard to judge but 3rd and hanging around in the title race see likely. Yes, I'm literally arguing against the very table you linked. It's really worrying if you read that comment and linked that table without realising I had to have used the table to write the comment.   My argument is that the xGA United conceded doesn't tell the full story, which agrees with it being a flawed metric, by saying United consistently managed to stop opponents putting up quality shots because of the high focus on box defending and low defensive aggression in the middle third.   Therefore, United could probably pretty consistently overperform that table with the strategy they used last season.   This isn't to say this is a good strategy, it isn't, but it's fine for finishing somewhere around 8th. Again, not particularly impressive or that relevant to their actual aspirations, but they weren't ""supposed to finish 12th"". Me disagreeing with his prediction is not the same as me agreeing with you that it's batshit. I don't think Arsenal will win the league, but I don't think that prediction was batshit either. The future isn't split into ""things I believe will happen"" and ""batshit theories"". The fact you read my comment as agreeing with you *is* batshit. Do you guys not remember how you were torn apart in the later part of the season? Do you guys remember how the season started and you were careful to even suggest that Top 4 is a done deal? Klopp and your team did much above expectations and that's why I don't think Top 4 is a done deal; with a new manager and an aging squad.  I ofcourse hope you don't even come Top 7 but thats a different story. [deleted] [deleted] I mean, our wheels completely fell off last year too, especially those at the back‚Ä¶ Same play style, our long term injuries were largely freak accidents though, not wear and tear. So did every other team lmao, we were absolutely decimated by injuries last year, 3 season ending ACL injuries to 3 important first 11 players. As well as being without Moreno and Ramsey  for almost the entire season through recurring injuries too, would also have been first 11 players.   We fell over the line last year because we were running on fumes, there were games where we had only 7 players on the bench with 2 of them being academy goalkeepers because we literally had no more players available to put on the bench.  Emery just doesn't fucking moan about it and make excuses, he gets on with it. I think you may have forgotten about the Champions League changes. We will because we have a proper manager who knows how to handle a European campaign, and ye have Eddie Howe. Last year was his first time in Europe, he didnt have a fuckin clue how to balance the squad between Europe and the PL, Emery is a serial winner and well used to going deep into European tournaments. We played all but 1 game in the EUCL last year and this year our squad is like 8 players bigger than last year. Wtf has that got to do with my question. The difference in quality between us and you is 22 points as of 3 months ago, so how are you bridging the gap?   Because from where I‚Äôm standing, we have a better squad with more depth and more world class players, a system that‚Äôs more suited to our personnel and more experience winning and competing for major trophies in the last 5 years. A lot of our core players had an insane amount of injuries which isn‚Äôt likely to happen again. If it does, fair enough but if not, you‚Äôre delusional if you think you‚Äôll make that deficit and finish above us. Cheers Geoff Well it‚Äôs clearly not that simple because you‚Äôd have done that last season now wouldn‚Äôt you. !RemindMe 9 months Happily will make a ¬£50 bet to a charity of your choice if you're that confident. > Chelsea looked decent against City, but with a new manager and that many players at the club  I don't know why people keep spouting this shit. The squad is 25 players at the moment. Is that high? Yeah, slightly, but it's definitely not outrageously so.  Counting Lukaku, Kepa or academy players like George and Acheampong that will not even get a minute in the season as squad players is a joke. When I say easily, I don't mean I definitely think it's going to happen. More so, if it happened I would not be surprised in the slightest. Our tactics were pretty bad last year, but damn near everyone one of our players were out of form, or hurt. Injuries are going to happen again because they play so many games, but I feel like we're prepared better for it. Casemiro already looks better, and if we get Ugarte, I feel confident with our midfield.   Also Zirksee may be just what Rashford needs. Zirkzee RW, Garnacho LW, and Hoijlund ST intrigues me a lot as well.      Martinez is our best player bar Bruno, missing him last year killed us. Honestly I think you're sleeping on our squad a bit, look at the changes we made against West ham, proper quality and we are still missing important players in kamara and tyrone.   If we sign a rightback (imperative) and maybe an attacker to replace diaby then I couldn't have hoped for more with the psr situation we faced. It's a liverpool with a complete new manager though. It certainly brings some uncertainty with it. The best players of liverpool are north of 30 (Ali, Salah, VVD). Obviously I don't except liverpool to fall to 7th. If you know what moyes reputation before going to us, you wouldn't say that. He has been consistently excellent with everton No manager in the world could have walked into that United team and achieved close to what Ferguson did. The club wasnt built for anyone but Fergie to succeed at that point. [deleted] Moyes had achieved more than slot before his appointment though. Slot could also be lost in the prem, could have trouble settling, etc..   Also I suspect Klopp makes his players look better than they are, sort of like Ferguson did, so Im not sure your whole squad would keep its level We beat Leeds 5-1 in Ole's third season and looked like we finally figured it out. They've also finished above Liverpool 2 times in the last few years after being a huge amount of points behind the previous season too. I don‚Äôt get this ‚Äúunderlying numbers‚Äùputting us at four to five places lower than 8th thing. Are there any underlying numbers more important than goals scored and goals conceded? I don't disagree that there should be better performances in spite of the injury situation. However, there can be different projections of how this season can develop from that. For example, is ETH an average or even mediocre manager just because he couldn't get performances out of an injury-hit team, or is he brilliant if given a chance to play his A game with a team that has fewer injuries and more depth? Different people are going to look at it differently due to their own allegiances. bro you are just making up your own opinion and conclusion to prove your point. Martinez and Shaw are as crucial as midfielders for United to start attack. You'd know if you watched enough games of United. Fans were happy with Evans and Khabwala because they did okay with the situation. does not mean they were as good as Martinez Varane. United conceded 57 goals. Liverpool conceded 44 and 47 goals the season their defenders were injured so by your logic, the impact of their injury was even minimalistic? lol. I am out arguing with a troll. I just presumed they replied to the wrong comment. You're right. So silly of me to include our captain and vice captain as players we missed through injury. Caicedo struggled in the first few months after being pretty much flawless for 18 months prior.  Enzo has been great pretty much his entire career before last season, even Lampard knew not to piss around with him and that was a manager that managed to make Rudiger look crap.  Badiashille was getting player of the year shouts despite joining in January, now he's seen as a figure of fun.  Nkunku was injured for a lot of the season but there was also signs before his injury (after the cup final) that Pochs tactics were starting to negatively effect him aswell.  Colwills stock was a lot higher last season than it was this.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on this one due to his age but Silva also had by some distance his worst season in European football aswell. ‚ÄòVilla away‚Äô yeah ok, clear as mud.  Not sure why a match in September is relevant to a top4 race you were never even in either but alrighty then. We‚Äôd mathematically finished above you with 5 games to go.   Whatever makes you feel better though ‚Äòchamp‚Äô Again, these are just random reddit talking points that don't line up with what Ornstein and other Tier 1s say, which is fine. Having lots of extra players for sale has always been a stated goal. Selling academy players that are back ups is what literally every team does, Villa included. I'd have rather kept Tuchel, but his personality hasn't meshed at multiple clubs now.   I don't like the hyper commodification of players either, but doing that and a multi-club model are the only real ways to keep up financially anymore. I agree with you, those are the 3 I would take, everyone else for over a billion is just piss poor. Jackson has fucking scored more League goals than Holjlund and injury prone Jesus. What are you on about. You seriously just whoring for karma. You get upvoted here for saying anything negative about Chelsea. It is just wild! We had the worst injury crisis in the past 3 seasons and we have managed to finish 6th, 12th and 3rd. People now act like we are a midtable team with rubbish players. You are a deluded clown, if you don't think the likes of Caicedo, Reece James, Cucurella, Gusto, Enzo can't start for teams like Man United, Newcastle, Tottenham and Aston Villa. That‚Äôs fine, I wouldn‚Äôt want to swap squads with some of them either So how can you say it‚Äôs ‚Äúinsane‚Äù that we could finish top 4. Our team is still very talented despite the mess that is the ownership You admit you don't watch Premier League, but somehow you are so sure about the strengths of all the squads in the League. GFOH! I do agree that some of the other teams have more defined roles, and will also probably benefit from having managers who have been there for a while. Like Spurs and Villa. The only three squads I‚Äôd definitively put above us are Liverpool, Arsenal and City.   Newcastle, I just don‚Äôt see it sorry. Gordon and Isak sure, but I don‚Äôt think their fullbacks are currently better than ours, I don‚Äôt think their midfield is either. I think they‚Äôre a huge question mark, but do benefit from having a structure already in place. Same with Villa, although I quite rate their team actually and I understand why people put them above us, though we have better depth.   Spurs, I think they have huge question marks too. They look very good on the ball and I do think they are a good team, but they have a bunch of inconsistent attackers, their depth is questionable, our midfield is better and the only place they really are clearly stronger is their defenders and keeper, but as we‚Äôve seen they‚Äôre incredibly vulnerable at the back. United, we have a better midfield than and again, I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôre being rated so highly when they looked terrible last season, they got very lucky with their results. Yes they‚Äôve reinforced in some areas but still don‚Äôt impress me much.   All in all, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much in it tbf, I get your reasoning about squad composition  and roles. But I think our squad is being strongly underestimated Take some reffing decisions away the City no penalty given, the arsenal handball in Anfield let alone the Spurs fiasco. That's like 5+ points with Arsenal and city having 2 less points. >don't have to be that much better  But they still have to be better. Which they're not since they lost Klopp. Who's to say that this current team draws against villa or City like last years team did? It's not like they ""just"" need to beat Luton, Everton and United. They need to match last season and do better, despite making no signings and losing one of the greatest managers the prem has ever seen How is that comparable?  Liverpool season vs season. Manager and philosophy change, squad has no additions.  Arsenal season vs season. Same manager and philosophy, additions to squad.   Literally all my point was is that a key point to Liverpool was Klopp‚Äôs influence on the side. And considering Arsenal and City have strengthened and kept their managers, I don‚Äôt see why Liverpool would suddenly be closer than last year. >that almost never happens  it has happened 3 times in the last 5 seasons. Lavia went off after 60 minutes, and our midfield collapsed. He was bossing it up to that point, tho Lavia was from Anderlecht's academy, and City bought him and tried to claim him as their own. As they do with many of their youth players.  Also, of course, Palmer was quiet because he didn't have James playing behind him eating up Doku and your LB Whilst I agree that we were never in the top 4 race(thanks to Poch). You should be much more worried about us thus season than last, because we got 6th in spite of Poch, not because of him. We really can't do much worse We got rid of Gallagher because he isn't suitable to the way we now want to play with the added benefit of pure profit, we've signed players who are suitable to that way of playing, who strengthen the squad overall.  I'm confident you will miss out on top four because your squad is poor and so is your coach, not that suggesting a team that were better than you over the entire year who have also strengthened and have had a years experience in the prem which is very important for a young squad, wouldn't place ahead of you still isn't perfectly reasonable on its own.  I watched many united games last season and my feeling is you massively overperformed in terms of results when compared to your performances, I think you'll struggle to repeat that, I also manifest this into existence with many crystals.  Joao Felix isn't an unproven wonderkid, neither is Pedro Neto, however if we're going by previous unproven wonderkids signed by our recruitment team then I'm confident they will mostly turn out to become proven quality. It's just another case of the Chelsea Derangement Syndrome. actually you're right, the squads fine after the managers quote today turns out theres no problems with squad harmony when you just dump the other half of the squad, dont see them, dont care about them  problem solved! How does that translate to ‚Äúsquad harmony is in shambles‚Äù? His explanation on manager to watch wasn't on them having huge impact though it was more around the idea that its high stakes for them. Slot has to follow in huge footsteps of Klopp, Ten Hag is walking on tightropes because Utd finished 8th last season and Maresca well its Chelsea who are a complete shitshow Right? such a strange combination of picks Yeah lol all these people talking as if an impact signing means guaranteed higher position for your team. There's so many other factors, the rest of the team performing worse, manager tactics, transfers in and out, etc. There are way too many examples out there. I agree Palmer was the impact signing last season. I just don‚Äôt see why Neto would make anywhere near his impact with his horrible injury record and high competition for his starting spot.   Also, what does them not breaking into the top 4 have to do with the impact signing pick? It seems like my comment was misunderstood, I‚Äôm not a native but I thought my English was clear enough, but let me know if I was unclear! Yes, but Palmer's impact put us from 10th in the table in the middle of the season to 6th. To then say that Neto is an impact signing but then not putting Chelsea even in any European positions is a bit weird. I think there‚Äôs too many factors playing against him to be a contender (bad injury record, inconsistent performances, high competition for starting spot).  I respect the stance but I just don‚Äôt agree that he has a good chance to be signing of the season. For me, going off the information we have right now, I am putting at least the following ahead:   Solanke, Onana, Smith Rowe, Carvalho, Minteh, Kamada, Buonanotte  This is just off those factors I mentioned. For example, Smith Rowe also has an extremely bad injury record, but he is more lethal in front of goal, and is probably guaranteed a starting spot in the lineup. I have a feeling Arteta has purchased Calafiori to play CB eventually. He has tried to sell Gabriel before and didn't start him for the first 3 games last season. Gabriel was one of our best players last season but Arteta is a lunatic with a vision. We have Zinchenko, Calafiori, Timber, Tomiyasu, Kiwior and Tierney who can all play left back... Timber can play multiple positions. In the Wolves game, he replaced Zinchenko so obviously Arteta is happy to play him on the left.  Edit: I mean this one is objectively true... not sure how someone can disagree with it lol. This thread has nothing to do with Villa. But on that note, I posted below that I think we‚Äôre due for a regression this year and am hoping for 6th/7th, but could see 8th even. I‚Äôm not blinded by bias What allegations? They are right that you were absolutely terrible last season and honestly scammed 8th. You are a very up and down club, you could finish top 4 or you could be shit the entire year and finish 7th cause it doesn't matter how you shit you are this fraudulent league never lets you finish outside europe. I don‚Äôt think they will, but I think it will be very close. Imo we‚Äôre due for a slight regression this year. I have us finishing 6th/7th I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so easy to say because so many players are question marks. Rashford scored 17 in EtHs first season, Hojlund had a great second half of the season but has to show that he can consistently deliver as well as stay fit and Garnacho is immensely talented. Bruno we obviously don‚Äôt have to talk about. It could be the worst front four but it also could be one of the better ones if things go right for them.   I would definitely not say it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasily‚Äù the worst though even if it looked like it last season In what world is a front 4 of Garnacho Hojlund Amad and Bruno easily the worst front four in the top 8? Right, and I‚Äôm arguing that these metrics in general are flawed and often misleading, which you effectively confirmed with your response here > Do you guys not remember how you were torn apart in the later part of the season?  We had a really bad April, but still finished 7 points off Arsenal and 9 off City. Even then, it was more of a case of bad finishing over anything else. The game against your shite was nearly an hour of one way traffic and not taking chances until Quansah made a mistake (we had an xG of 4 to your 1).  The Palace game we missed sitter after sitter in the second half, with Jones' being the worst example of that (we had an xG of 3.4 to Palace's 2).   Even the Everton game which was the biggest example of a poor performance and we deservedly lost we still created chances and actually had a higher xG than them again.   West Ham was another example of us wasting chances.   So again, torn apart is blatant revisionism. Not at our best by any stretch, but much more of a case of missing chances to an egregious level - we were still creating them with ease.  > Do you guys remember how the season started and you were careful to even suggest that Top 4 is a done deal?  I thought we'd be back in the top 3 comfortably last season and thought there was quite a good chance for 2nd.   > Klopp and your team did much above expectations and that's why I don't think Top 4 is a done deal  Why would I take into the account the expectations of idiots who underrated our team in the first place? They were clearly wrong so why does that have any bearing? People wrote us off after one poor season with a midfield that had fallen apart, as soon as we rectified that, we were back to challenging. Haha torn apart? We lost a couple of games in April when it was already clear we weren't going to win the league but before that we kept up with Man City and Arsenal all season with a midfield that had never played together before. We lost 4 games all season to Arsenal's 5 and City's 3. This team is settled now.  There might be a drop off in how well Liverpool do this season, but I really doubt it will be enough for any of Tottenham/Villa/Newcastle/Man U/Chelsea to make up 15-20 points on us.  As for the idea we have an aging squad... We don't? If anything our issue is the opposite. The only players in our squad that will need replacing in the next couple of years are Salah, Van Dijk, and potentially Robertson, although 30 isn't ancient for a full back. (Endo is 31 but was never intended to be a long term option and probably won't play much this season anyway)  Besides Salah, our attackers are 27, 27, 25, 25 Besides Endo, our midfielders are 21, 22, 23, 23, 25 Besides Van Dijk, our defenders are aged 21, 21, 25, 25, 27, 30.  Calling it an aging squad is pretty laughable This nonsense about an aging squad is wild. Only 4 of our starters are above 30 years old; Robertson, Alisson, Van Dijk and Salah. 3 of those are one of if not the best in the world in their positions. Salah‚Äôs shown no signs of slowing down and goalkeepers primes are well into their 30‚Äôs. Van Dijk was our player of the season last year. The only question mark is Robbo.  Endo is not a starter as he already seems to be out of favour with Slot. Oh I think we're in the mix but I'm confident in what I've seen from Slot and in the gamebreaker players we have that we'll be a step above in third. The most recent evidence says I should be confident until the squad shows me otherwise. Every club has injuries yeah, but it was us and Newcastle who had the absolute worst of it. You can search it up if you like. United and Newcastle were absolutely battered by injuries last season.   Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I feel like Newcastle are a lot better than people give them credit for. And I think you guys are just a little overrated. Soft underbelly, concede way too much. Nope. I haven't. Point still stands. Villa won't play the level of fixtures we did, so I expect they'll do better. I doubt it, but reminder bot is set up for May, we'll revisit this then and you'll either be proved correct or not. Luckly for us football isnt played on paper. Yet it has happened twice in 4 years. We also and an insane amount of injury last season. We were playing our 5th and 6th cb last season. Both our lb's and strikers were injured as well at many points. We don‚Äôt need 9 months üòÇ !remindme 8.5 months Ill make that donation myself, it ought not to depend on chance. Fair enough then, but your squad size isn't the only reason I don't think you'll make top 4 - you've just haven't looked good enough the last 2 years and significantly overperformed last season because of how good Palmer was (and that was without Europe). I would go so far as to say that your season hinges on how good Palmer will be, and while I think he's definitely good enough to carry you lot a second time, having your season hinge on a single player is never a good thing (take it from a United fan, we did it for years with Bruno).  The amount of turnover (both incoming and outgoing) is a tough task for ANY manager, especially one with Chelsea's squad size. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't see Chelsea making top 4. I agree that you do have an extremely talented squad with a great manager at the helm, but it just looks like a story we've seen before with Newcastle. The new format of the UCL is even more games, which increases the likelihood of burnout and player getting injured - even if you don't advance to the knockouts and avoid those extra games, there's a pretty decent chance you'll face injuries in the first half that carry over into January. And this is a Villa team that, aside from last season, just isn't used to playing in Europe/that load as a whole (yes you were in the conference league season, but this is the UCL, that too in a more grueling format).  That being said, I really do hope Villa do well this season (just not better than us hahaha) - great players, and god knows I'd love to see Emery keep succeeding in the prem after all the shit he got at Arsenal Of course. New manager, new tactics. There is obviously room for Liverpool to slip down in terms of points tally a bit.  Klopp wasn't the only reason we challenged last season though. The squad is legitimately good with some world class players. Not perfect obviously. So long as Slot doesn't disappoint, that team is more than good enough on paper to get top four again, and should be favourites for 3rd.  The teams below Liverpool are the ones who have to prove they have a better shot at 3rd, and so far, I believe only United have made signings that could make that arguement 31 is young for a keeper. Onana goes 29 this season, will he need replacing soon?  Salah and VVD are north of 30 and will need replacing in the next couple of years but that's literally it, they both look in great shape right now.  Salah will get 25+ g/a again and Van Dijk doesn't like he's going to fall off a cliff anytime soon.  Robertson has just turned 30 so may need replacing soonish but doesn't seem to be slowing down yet. The only other player in our entire squad over 30 is Endo who isn't expected to play much this season anyway. We have a really young squad. Keepers can play at the top level until late 30s. Salah is over 30 but he‚Äôs the fittest player at the club and his injury record is unmatched. He was/is a good manager, but he has his limitations and isn't suited to management at the very top level. Even at the time it was clear that it was going to be asking a lot for him to make the step up to managing a top club and his style of play wasn't really suited to it. > No manager in the world could have walked into that United team and achieved close to what Ferguson did.  That's an entirely different argument. More of an indictment of us than anything else - we were literally days from no longer existing during that period and had the worst manager in our modern history in Hodgson.   Moyes was a manager who did a brilliant job with Everton, but always looked like he'd struggle to make a step up. Did he? Slot took a mid table Feyenoord and won the league in his second season. Moyes won his first top flight trophy as a manager with West Ham in 2023. Not really, especially in terms of trophies won. That's all fair, but I would say that Klopp left us with a young squad that includes a healthy amount of veterans, where Fergie left Moyes an aging squad that required a lot of work. Without the midfield rebuild last year, it would've been a different conversation.  Of course, you're right that slot could end up not being a good match for the pl or we could struggle with shitload of injuries which isn't uncommon for us. if ur conceding insane amounts of chances and the other team is hitting the post or shooting wide, u cant say ur defending well. and if u dont create as many chances in the box as the other team, but bruno scores from 30 meters out, u cant say u had a good attack either. i dont usually go by xg and shit but united proved how bad they were on the pitch You're twisting the argument, or just misunderstanding it, I'm not certain which. So let's simplify it.  My original claim was that without excessive injuries in the in the 20/21 and 22/23 seasons Liverpool would likely have finished ahead of United. Your counter claim was that, according to my logic, without excessive injuries last season it's possible that United would have finished ahead of Liverpool.  Let's break it down and we'll see why your counter is highly unlikely.   Here's Liverpool's points over the last five seasons:  * 23/24 - 82 * 22/23 - 67 (injury crisis) * 21/22 - 92 * 20/21 - 69 (injury crisis) * 19/20 - 99  And here's United:  * 23/24 - 60 (injury crisis) * 22/23 - 75 * 21/22 - 58 (downed tools under Rangnick) * 20/21 - 74 * 19/20 - 66  We can clearly see from this that Liverpool's lowest points total in injury free seasons (across the last 5 seasons) is 82. So there's little reason to believe that if they did not have an injury crisis in 22/23 or 20/21, where they scored 67 and 69, that their points total would be considerably lower than 82, if at all. Even if they did score lower than 82, they only needed to score higher than 75 and 74 to place above United, hardly a drastic leap. So I think my claim that they would place above United, while not a certainty, has some merit.  In comparison, we can see that United's highest points total in injury free seasons (again across the last 5 seasons) is 75. Based on this evidence it seems highly unlikely that with an injury free season in 23/24 that they would have surpassed Liverpool's points total of 82. Your claim that the same excuse is valid for United is just wishful thinking.  In fact the last time United broke the 80 point mark was in the 17/18 season with a total of 81. And the last time they surpassed Liverpool's total of 82 was in the 12/13 season where they last won the title under Ferguson with 89 points.  I hope you can now more clearly see the difference between the two sets of circumstances. Your captain has played 26 league matches the last 2 years. At this point if he plays is noteworthy and his absence is a given.   Chillwell has played 42 games the last 3 seasons he is also a player that you don't see very often.  At this point you know they won't surpass 20 games a year so why include them. Ah yeah Colwill definitely nose dived in form, but frankly he might just be a system player that looked good under De Zerbi (maybe, maybe not). Silva was like 38, he was going to drop off at some point   I really disagree with that Enzo stuff, he was great in the Portuguese league I'm sure, but he's always been very whelming when I watch him play club football. Many other Chelsea players had a fear factor previously (and some still do like Palmer or Lavia) but Enzo... No  Won't lie I don't know how good badiashille was before so can't comment. I will say though that poch did make many players play well and I don't think he was given enough credit when he improved chelsea massively last season despite the injury crisis. >‚ÄòVilla away‚Äô yeah ok, clear as mud.  One win against you away from top 4 yeah. It was clear enough for everyone but you to understand, no need to get pissy now because you can't parse a basic sentence Cheer up pal Karma farming for 5 upvotes on a thread nobody cares about. Okay bud.  But you need to chill. I‚Äôm not personally attacking you as a person, I‚Äôm just stating who I would take over Jackson. I would have all of those players in my team over Jackson for various reasons. I don‚Äôt rate Jackson personally, that‚Äôs not me saying he‚Äôs a bad player because he just isn‚Äôt.It‚Äôs just my opinion, on an app that is all about just stating opinions. Get a life mate, why do you care about upvotes? üòÇ You don‚Äôt even have a good goalkeeper, pure delulu Talented for sure, but many are unproven, young, and inexperienced at the top level. Sterling, Nkunku, and Kepa are all your oldest players. They didn‚Äôt do as well as they could last year, so the argument that ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt do better because they lost Klopp‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me.  If they came 3rd last year and everything had gone well, players performed to their level, no injuries etc, then yes, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôll do worse this year.  There was lots of room for improvement last year, and a new manager might be just the thing to unlock it. The motivation of a new challenge alone should bring some of their players back up a notch. For who? Liverpool? Nah When has Palmer had James behind him? The guys been injured most of Palmers pro career‚Ä¶ And lavia played like 3 years with City. That‚Äôs ancity academy guy who‚Äôs your best midfielder You say Ten Hag is poor and yet he has more success and experience than Maresca, Man Utd have also strengthened.   >>your squad is poor  I Disagree, there‚Äôs a hole in DM but there‚Äôs still Bruno, Holjund, Martinez etc. who could start for plenty of teams in the league at least it isn‚Äôt bloated like yours and Ten Hag has control of the dressing room  Felix hasn‚Äôt been amazing for you lot and Neto has a bad injury record, but i‚Äôm interested to see how they do this season   At least you gave reasons for why you think that, even if I disagree with them, thanks for that Ah okay fair enough - guess that‚Äôs the issue with these graphics being independent of the show. So he's watching who gets sacked first?  Hint: It will be Maresco. Then Ten Hag. No one is claiming that that‚Äôs what impact signing means.   The reason I think Neto as impact signing is a dumb take is that he has joined a squad with an over saturated front line and a horrendous injury record. There‚Äôs way too many things that have to fall into place for him to be a consideration for that pick.   But go on with the straw man. We could have just as easily been having this conversation last year about if a pundit said that Palmer was going to be the impact signing. Then people would be saying ""the kid who never played much minutes at city?""  I just don't write off players as easily I suppose. Sure Neto has his injury concerns just as chelsea did as a whole. But who knows, he could have a lucky year with injuries and really show what he can do. 12th* I genuinely don't understand what you mean by high competition for starting spot when he was signed for the LW spot and his competition is Mudryk and Sterling (recently out of the squad).  Out of the players you listed I'd say only 3 are his real competition since there is a huge bias for an forward when it comes to impact.   I'd rank Solanke, Minteh and Onana higher than him because they're more consistently productive and less injury prone. But he has the advantage of being in an ambitious yet underperforming team that can improve massively.   So when you say Neto as impact signing is the worst take and list players like Smith Rowe, who has barely played in 2 years, and Kamada (whoever that is) I doubt you're being fair. I say this on the Arsenal sub and people have downvoted it before. But yeah there is a chance that Gabriel ends up being the odd man out. Arteta has definitely signaled it before with him choosing to not play him early in the campaign last season. Then he realized what he was doing wasn't working - Timber being injured meant it became this weird thing that obviously needed more stability in a CB pairing.    If you had Timber and Calaffiori playing on the left you could always have one invert and the other play in the back 3. It allows them both to go forward at times and both can stay back to defend when the other moves up the pitch. !remind me 1 year [deleted] > I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so easy to say because so many players are question marks  I mean, the future is always a question mark. I'm judging the eight teams on what I've seen. It's hardly controversial to say a team that scored between 20 and 40 goals less than the others have the worse attack. I think Zirkzee will end up taking H√∏jlund's spot permanently, but that doesn't move much for me.  As for Rashford obviously it could be re-evaluated if he got back to his best. But that's a pretty big if. As a man utd fan myself, why have you got Amad over Rasford? Amad is not a proven entity in the PL at all, this could be his breakout season if he keeps his head down and plays when he gets the chance. who of these teams are you saying that‚Äôs a better front 4 than: city, arsenal, liverpool, villa, tottenham, chelsea and newcastle? at best, it‚Äôs maybe debatable with tottenham. the other 6 are all just clearly better.  you guys haven‚Äôt scored 60 goals for three straight seasons. where does this overestimation even come from? This one. The one where you score 20 goals less than the worst of the 7, less than Everton, same as Palace, within five goals of Brighton, Bournemouth, Fulham, Brentford and Luton.   As I said Bruno is class, but you're putting three players with 21 PL goals combined up against the 7 strongest attacks in the league.   I know that some United-fans get a weird transfer window confidence boost every year, but I'm just watching football and staring the obvious. Arsenal city Liverpool attack clearly better. Gordon, Isaak better, son, Solanke better, Palmer Neto, better, that's already United in 7th, it is arguable with Villa, but I will still predict Villa to finish above you. You united fans never learn¬† Newcastle and United definitely aren‚Äôt only two that got battered by injuries. We got just as battered with injuries yet finished above both of you in the table We will see brother, if we stay injury free I am genuinely not worried about any of ye, I am worried about City and Arsenal. Everyone plays 2 teams from each pot so you're either a dumbass who talks shite or you did forget the changes because Villa will arguably play more difficult fixtures. No no injuries only count when it happens to Liverpool. You never know what can happen, but it seems as mad a prediction now as it did two weeks ago. Typical United fans hyping themselves up that they‚Äôre back because of *another* few new toys The difference is we have a manager who is as experienced as they come in Europe and managing Europe plus the players had a taster last year. We don't play the most physically intense style of football either, it will be hard no doubt but I think we'll be alright. [deleted] He did leave a better squad than Fergie left for Moyes wont argue with that. But still think you needed a marquee signing to boost morale and add quality It really is incredible how many people have piss poor reading comprehension. You don't rate Jackson, but you somehow rate players that were worse than him. Isn't that ironic? I honestly can't take you and most of the karma whores on this sub seriously. No one that actually watched premier League would think Cucurella, Gusto, Reece James, Caicedo and Enzo can't start for teams like Villa, Spurs, Newcastle and Man United. Even Lavia would easily start ahead of Casemiro and Mount who have been one of the worst players in the League. And other teams have weaknesses too. Fuck outta here. I‚Äôm not delusional, I‚Äôm not even saying were gonna finish top 4 Yes, but many other teams have question marks. Especially the ones around us, many of which  we performed better than last season despite a horrific injury crisis and a terrible start to the season. I just don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs ‚Äúinsane‚Äù to see us in fourth. Unlikely? Sure, but it‚Äôs well within the realms of possibility and it‚Äôs not like the other squads around us are much better (I don‚Äôt think many of them are at all) >There was lots of room for improvement last year  And there was even more room for disimprovement   >players performed to their level  Why would they perform to a better level this year? A few months is going to suddenly make nunez start putting it in the net?   Your argument here is that these players can step up their game to such an insane degree that it will not only make up for the loss of klopp, but actually make them perform even better than they did despite the fact it's their first season with a new manager  Yeah good one lol 20-21,22-23,23-24 He neither has had him behind him, but if he did, he would've dominated Doku(just like last time)and Gvardiol by himself.  As for Lavia, he played 3 years with City but probably twice as many with Anderlecht. He's an Anderlecht youth player. He's also not our best midfielder, but he was the best midfielder on the day and showed Grandpa Kevin levels ü§∑ You are welcome, my powerful crystals will not let me down. It seems my powerful crystals are hard at work. Well people are saying the same about Solanke, same defense for that? He's had a great season so him being an impact signing and spurs not finishing well is not so far-fetched. Middle of the last season. We were hovering around that position for a good while, until we started to get points more consistently. Ah, so Mudryk on the 7 year or whatever contract is not meant to be strong competition for the other player you just signed? And the other LW that you signed the window before lol  I just don‚Äôt think he would leave a good impact because he is not consistent and lethal enough for me, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Mudryk outperforms his G/A this season.  It‚Äôs not that deep, it‚Äôs just my opinion based on what I‚Äôve seen of Neto over the last seasons.  You don‚Äôt know Kamada from Frankfurt, that‚Äôs all I needed to know to judge how much you know about elite football players. Smith Rowe hasn‚Äôt played much because he was in a high performing Arsenal XI whenever he was actually fit. He was probably injured the same as Neto, but at least he‚Äôs a great finisher and consistent performer. If you think Neto will have a better season than ESR (provided injury days are similar) you‚Äôre having a laugh Yeah I edited to include where I expect us to finish? How is that ‚Äúhilarious‚Äù It‚Äôs just lazy a prediction to go ‚Äúbut last season‚Äù. Also having a lower goal tally doesn‚Äôt mean their striker sucks. They play a lot more conservative and defensive, especially after being up than any of the other teams which will obviously result in less goals. I mean United still had a better defensive record with all their injuries than the four teams immediately ahead of them. Does that then also mean Evans and Casemiro are a better cb partnership than Romero and VdV or Torres and Konsa? Form, Amad has been one of our brightest spots this preseason. This might obviously not convert to the actual season but he's at the very least merited the chance My argument was never that we're better or that we'll finish above anyone. Rather that it's silly to say that we're our front four is ""easily"" the worst in the top 8. I never said we're anywhere near having the best attack.    Like you and others have replied (in agreement) there are arguments to be made that our attack is as good if not better than a few of the top 8 teams. Hmm, I wonder which of us is playing in Europa then? Plus you guys have DEPTH lmao Lol or third option, I'm correct, Villa fixtures will not be harder than PSG x 2, Dortmund x 2 and AC Milan x 2. Fair enough - I still think the European schedule coupled with a top 4 push will be too much for the players, but let's agree to disagree No I'm not, plenty of people thought Moyes was a risky appointment at the time that wouldn't work out. It's just United supporters that blindly ignored his flaws because he had the Fergie endorsement. Yeah, definitely wouldn't hurt. We need a top class DM that's almost flawless on the ball and a CB that's willing to compete for a spot with no guarantees. With those I'd say top 4 is almost certain and maybe a title run for at least a little while.   Think we'll get the CB in the coming weeks but not sure about the DM, given we're looking for a special player and so is everyone else. Reece James can't even start for Chelsea given he's injured all the time. Can't call him a top player at this stage until he proves he's still at that level after being out so long.  You have the worst starting keeper out of last seasons top 10.  Enzo hasn't looked good bar a handful of games since he's arrived at the club.  Jackson is dogshit and you know it.  What actual proven talent have Chelsea added to the squad? Neto and... Nothing. Also just sold your most consistent midfielder in Gallagher. If Oshimen happens then maybe things look different. Well it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm expecting Nunez to become prime Suarez. I just think every player performed worse than I‚Äôve seen them perform. You don‚Äôt suddenly become that much worse overnight, so I expect them to be able to get back to a level they‚Äôve been before. We‚Äôll see in 6 months or so if that turns out to be true It‚Äôs only 2 games in lol, we‚Äôll wait until May Whoever says that needs to read up on the definition of an impact signing lol I'm clearly shit at reading, seen someone else say yous finished 10th season before last and ran with it lmao.   >You don‚Äôt know Kamada from Frankfurt, that‚Äôs all I needed to know to judge how much you know about elite football players  I thought tou were talking about the 18 year old Kamara Crystal Palace signed from Lazio.   I'm shocked at ESR being a great finisher with just 12 goals in all this time I've known of him.   The rest has been said by the other guy that replied. >Ah, so Mudryk on the 7 year or whatever contract is not meant to be strong competition for the other player you just signed? And the other LW that you signed the window before lol  Mudryk will be competition but not a strong one if he doesn't greatly level up his game. And what other LW did we sign besides Sterling, whom we want to get rid of?  >I just don‚Äôt think he would leave a good impact because he is not consistent and lethal enough for me, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Mudryk outperforms his G/A this season.  Consistency is debatable, but football isn't all about G/A. Hazard was enough proof for that  >Smith Rowe hasn‚Äôt played much because he was in a high performing Arsenal XI whenever he was actually fit  Smith hasn't played much because he's not particularly that good and struggled for even rotation minutes.  >He was probably injured the same as Neto, but at least he‚Äôs a great finisher and consistent performer.  ESR is a great finisher? Also, he's consistently above average, and I'd rather an inconsistent good player than average consistent one ü§∑  >If you think Neto will have a better season than ESR (provided injury days are similar) you‚Äôre having a laugh  If you don't think Neto is clear of ESR as a player and won't have a better season than him providing both similar availability, you're having a huge giggle > It‚Äôs just lazy a prediction to go ‚Äúbut last season‚Äù.   I mean it's three straight seasons of scoring less than 60. When you don't strengthen significantly and score markedly less than other teams you don't go ahead of them in the ranking for free.  > They play a lot more conservative and defensive, especially after being up than any of the other teams which will obviously result in less goals.  They got completely run over in defense last year. Somehow they managed to overperform their xGA by 17(!). That's not a result of sitting back. They had a negative GD ffs.   But even if we pretend they didn't get completely romped, the difference between 0.1 GA per game is marginale while the difference between 0.5 and 1 GF per game is pretty substantial.  You know that too.   Please tell me what I should base United's attack being better than any of the others' on? What form? He's barely played for us. Or are you talking about preseason? Yh, your definitely not easily the worst, but the claim isn't so outrageous when there are probably 8 teams in the PL who get at least 2 of their attackers into your lineup Absolutely stupid point considering we finished above you in the league. You got in the Europa league via the FA Cup. And we may ‚ÄúDEPTH‚Äù but that wasn‚Äôt true last season when we were being battered by injuries. Jackson is ""dogshit"" and still managed to score more League than Arsenal and Man U strikers. A dogshit doesn't score 14 no penalty League goals. Enzo will easily start for all the 4 teams I listed. What kind of silly question is that? We have lots of proven talents. Caicedo, Palmer, Gusto, Colwill, Nkunku, Enzo, Lavia, Jackson, Fofana, Reece James, Noni, Neto and Cucurella. Deluded clowns like you only want to spew the same nonsense the hiveminds are spewing. >Reece James can't even start for Chelsea given he's injured all the time. Can't call him a top player at this stage until he proves he's still at that level after being out so long.  Gusto can, tho, and he clears most of the RBs in the league.  >You have the worst starting keeper out of last seasons top 10.  Sadly, true  >Enzo hasn't looked good bar a handful of games since he's arrived at the club.  He looked more than good enough under Potter and Lampard. Poch is just a washed clown who made our players look much worse than inactuality they are  >Jackson is dogshit and you know it.   At least he knows how to trap a ball, unlike that donkey Nunez  >What actual proven talent have Chelsea added to the squad? Neto and... Nothing. Also just sold your most consistent midfielder in Gallagher. If Oshimen happens then maybe things look different.  Neto is one more than anything Liverpool added(and would be your starting LW). Gallagher is trash, tho, and needed to be gone. We also don't need Oshimen to finish above Liverpool and in the top 4 And the point is if they get back to that level they still won't be title contenders because they weren't the season before last and they've lost klopp Where's the fun in that? üòé Lol you say ""nobody is claiming that"" when the very guy who you replied to is claiming exactly that. Don't act like it came out of nowhere. Honestly the xG and xGA stuff can‚Äôt be thrown around without context. When you go 1:0 up inside the first half and subsequently decide to sit back your opponent will rack up xG. It was the same for Union in the Bundesliga. Just look at their game against Newcastle: Were the better team until they scored and decided to sit back until they conceded. And that repeated three times.   I just don‚Äôt think Watkins, McGinn, Rogers and Bailey is easily better than what United have and think it has far more to do with their tactics than their player material. I guarantee you that if you swap these front fours Emerys Villa would have still ended up with more goals last season. And if you read my comment again I don‚Äôt claim they‚Äôre better than anyone, just that you‚Äôre viewing this in a very narrow way completely devoid of context or tactical differences. Did Luton also have a better front four than Cunha, Hwang, Neto and Sarabia because they scored more than Wolves? Well yeah mate I thought that was clear when I used the word preseason Brother you were only 3 points above us, while we went and won the FA cup. We had the better season despite our injuries. Clearly we prioritised silverware. What terrible point are you trying to make here? One Neto and Maresca doesn't elevate Chelsea to Liverpools level. You'll need a ST, GK and reliable CB pairing for that to happen. I rate Colwill, but Fofana hasn't played 5 consecutive games since he played for Leicester and will need to prove he's as good as he was then, Disasi is more of a Disaster, Silva is gone, Chalobah is getting kicked out.  I'm not at all convinced by Maresca. Winning the Championship with Leicester, while deserving credit, isn't a huge accomplishment.   Gallagher was not trash by any means, such a disrespected player.  Liverpool obviously need a signing or two, but that's to challenge for the title, not to challenge for top four. Klopp is obviously a big loss, but so long as Slot has half a brain he should be more than able to get that squad 3rd or 4th. Klopp wasn't the only reason Liverpool were in the title race as long as they were. We‚Äôll see! Fair point, shit on everyone else while you can Thank you lol, not sure why he started calling my argument a strawman when he himself doesn't even know what he's replying to. Oh shit you‚Äôre right lol, my bad. I don‚Äôt agree with that though I do think it‚Äôs more likely for impact signings to improve the overall performances of the team they signed for. > When you go 1:0 up inside the first half and subsequently decide to sit back your opponent will rack up xG  Racking up xGA correlates with racking up goals against. Man United were the 11th best team in the first half last season. There were only 10 leads to defend, and about a goal every other game. (GD of -1, 22-23). They didn't go ahead and sit back. All the other teams went ahead, because scoring 2-3 goals per game is something 7 other teams did. Guess which.  United's defensive stats is because they conceded a million chances. A better front four, would probably have capitalized on just how much the opponent was attacking, in fact... Well, if you're going to go by preseason then we'd have a certain Brazilian Pirlo playing for us. You didn‚Äôt prioritise silverware, you also were so shit in your performances that underlying stats suggested you were a lower mid table level team. You got by on individual quality and luck in many games where you were absolutely dominated. And yet despite all of this, my initial point was only that we suffered as bad an injury crisis as you and Newcastle, yet finished above you both which is a literal FACT But, you are more convinced by the new Liverpool manager? Liverpool with their aging spine would have struggled really bad, if they had the countless injuries our main starters had the past 3 seasons. There isn't a gulf of difference between our squad. GTFH with your silly agenda! Speaking of shitting on people. üòâüí© So how many trophies did you win that season bud? You‚Äôre kidding yourself if you think whole squad and board wouldn‚Äôt prefer to have our season. Gtfo here man lmao. 3 points difference compared to silverware.   We beat the champions to win our cup. You lot could only dream of such. They just slapped you silly in front of your home crowd after you bought all the players available this window lmao. And they were in first gear the whole time. We are not the same. ""But you are convinced by the new Liverpool manager?""  Moreso than Maresca. Slot has won the Eredivisie title and Dutch equivalent of the FA Cup in recent years.  The game against City was Maresca's first top flight match as a manager. Yeah you can keep laughing  I guess we‚Äôre both one big pile of shit. While Man Utd are getting rid of Glazer influence, you lot have just got Glazers lite very recently, enjoy üòâ Ahahahahah ok I see what you are. You‚Äôre either a stupid troll or just a child. You‚Äôre so embarrassed of your club you don‚Äôt even have a United flair. I bet you haven‚Äôt even stepped foot in Manchester ‚Äúbud‚Äù [removed] A Lazy comparison just because they're American, they have had a vision/project in mind since they joined, and the vast majority of our recruitment has clearly fit into that, they have put people in place that have signed many players for small fees that would now demand huge fees, people like to dunk on our owners, but they have got a lot right more recently.  As for your club, it has been ran far more like a circus and it remains to be seen if that will change, i have some sympathy for the people running the show because they clearly didn't want ETH to remain but had no better options at that time, but as i've already made clear to you i think your squad is painfully average and very mix match, unlike ours, and to be honest i haven't rated much of your recruitment since the new people have been in place, so i don't have high hopes for them in the short term.  I full expect that to become evident for everyone in a year or two in the state we will be in compared to you. Lmao what‚Äôs that got to do with anything? Doesn‚Äôt mean I like the club any less, nor does it change the fact that we still had a better season than you lol. üò≠ü´µüèæ If this is what you have to resort to, then you‚Äôve clearly lost your head. Lmao.   Just accept the facts brother. No silverware, playing in conference instead of Europa, and just a 3 point difference? Be honest with yourself mate. You think it's more impressive to win the Championship with Leicester than it is to win a top flight title in the Eredivisie with Feyenoord? Is this a way of kissing Maresca's ass, disrespecting the Eredivisie, or both? Nah I just cba to reason with someone who clearly is incapable of basic reading comprehension. And it‚Äôs even funnier that I was right about you never having set foot in Manchester. Maybe one day you‚Äôll get to go bud, or maybe you‚Äôll be supporting someone else by then. I wonder if you can point out Old Trafford on a map You sure you aren‚Äôt describing yourself there bud? You seem to be the only one ignoring facts here. Quite ironic.   Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs quite said that this is what you‚Äôve had to resort to? Incapable of making a solid, rational argument? None of what you‚Äôve said invalidates my prior point that United still had the better season. Doesn‚Äôt change anything lol Lad im a United fan but it seems that you are illiterate, the man talked about injuries and you‚Äôre bringing up the fact that we‚Äôre playing in Europa and won a trophy, your point isn‚Äôt relevant to the topic he was talking about. So you decided to retort to a point that I made with a point that wasn‚Äôt even relevant at all to what I was saying? Yeah, that‚Äôs a lack of reading comprehension right there. You might need to scrub up on the conventions of conversation.  The plastic fan jokes are just funny because they‚Äôre true. Guess what, I‚Äôve seen my team win titles in person and experienced that joy in the stadium and surrounded by fans. I‚Äôve been to watch my team in person countless times. It‚Äôs a shame you‚Äôve never had that, it‚Äôs truly a wonderful experience."
