They are the worst kind of injuries because they keep coming back. It's better to buy someone coming off a broken leg Huh? They demand the release clause fee after it runs out? What?  ""Beware, after the clause runs out we will ask for the exact same price still so you better hurry!"" However, they want the same amount? Lipsk doesn't need to sell and he has a long contract. Why make it easy for anyone? Will Dinamo Zagreb receive something? What teams even need someone of his profile right now as a starter? Hasn‚Äôt gotten? Yes, I kinda wanted him but paying 60 million for an injury prone player while being in our situation is unreasonable and I was secretly hoping his RC would just expire. So is Olise though The argument every German fan is giving against Olmo is the same one you guys laughed about Madrid fans when Bayern bought Robben.  If Olmo was Brazilian nobody would bat an eye at paying 60m for him. Idk i think its crazy to not shelf the 60 million. Ge has the ability to decide the outcone of every game I wonder how true the ‚Äúregion beta paradox‚Äù is for players who have broken a leg over players with these niggling injuries.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-beta_paradox Sounds like he‚Äôs primed for a Barcelona transfer Buying player who shows up in international tournament is always very risky move. And with olmo injury factors, don't think anyone will go for him. They can demand what they want? Thats the price they sell him for, otherweise they keep him. Whats so hard to get? He‚Äôs still under contract until 2027, so it‚Äôs kinda justified It's more like... Liepzig don't want to sell so it would still take 60M to change their minds. 20% of RB Leipzig‚Äôs profit. That would amount to around 6 million if he is sold for 60 million. Watch us get him instead of nico Olmo is a great player when fit, Robben is a tier above and it was still a big gamble by Bayern. i can believe it, with a broken bone once it's healed it's mostly just getting the mental confidence back after a freak injury. Having muscle injury issues must be terrible because you'll start to slowly not have trust in your body. It makes sense.  Bones usually require external treatment obviously but you fix them, you know they are fixed. With soft tissue you never know if it's fixed or not and it's super easy to come back and have another injury.  If you ask me if I have full confidence in my ankle I would say ""no"" still today after 15 years. Do I have problems with it? also no, but I don't trust it bacause I know sometimes it betrais me and I roll my ankle. Since my tendons are elongated I do not sprain it, I physically can't sprain it anymore (a serious injury + hypermobility) and I feel amost nothing after rolling my ankle, but still, I cannot trust it and will never trust it. I can do sports, I can live my life normally, I can't trust that fucker haha. has nothing to do with actual physical recovery so can‚Äôt be applied here I think it's a bit unfair to say Olmo just showed up at the international tournament. He has always been a top player when healthy. You are right about the injury risk My point is than prices never go down after a release clause ends, they either go up or the player becomes unsellable. Ive genuinely never seen a player being sold for the same price. And tbh its just such an odd sentence to read.   That said with his price staying at 60m I can totally see a premier league team going for him. He performed really well at the euros. Buying a place based on an international tournament is not a great ideax I get the feeling that youre missing the point of my post Usually it will go up and not down. 6 mil is 10%? Watch us spend 120 on both and completely ignore the cdm hole in the mf. I can already smell that coming ffs Hello fellow dodgy ankle fellow. I sprained mine three times over the course of one summer about 15 years ago, and since then, it has been trying to get back at me It's said that his price has remained the same cause he has a gentleman agreement with Leipzig for staying there even when a lot of promising players left last summer. they think the release clause reflects his true value considering his skill and injury history that they are willing to let go for the right price.   they probably want to stay an attractive club for players one step away from making a breakthrough and keep a positive relationship with agents.  a release clause has to be paid in full, but a club could try to negotiate to pay it in installments with this knowledge. you can plan around this income and reinvest it while injury happens randomly that make the player unavailable and you have nothing or an asset worth even less now. I get the feeling that youre missing they dont want to sell him unless they get that money if it expires just like that, it means noones in a rush to pay that much for him. I think it basically mean the reporter has no information ... Profit, not the whole sale. Our sale to RB Leipzig amounted to around 30mil with bonuses included. They will sell him for 60, the profit is 30mil and 20% of that is 6. Romeu comeback season here we go üî•üî•üî• Eric Garcia as pivot it is time i can foresee it Yeah, those injuries do not really heal back to what they used to be, it feels like you just ""heal"" based on how it is after the injury and your body adapts.  You are healed, you are just not at what your 100% used to be anymore. Yeah youre just confirming what I just said lol. Not the point. The price after release clauses expire normally go up. They dont stay the same. Thank you for the clarification. That makes sense. Hopefully comeback to Girona Eric and Christensen double pivot ü•∂ Sry mb, missunderstood your comment. Thought you say they shouldnt demand as much now Dw. Yeah usually when the clause runs out and you want to keep the player, price goes up. If they really want to keep him you would expect them to ask for 80m or something.   Essentially I was making fun of them asking for the exact same price and the way bild worded it. I guess you can have your fantasy world where Leipzig would prefer 80m or whatever post-clause expiration but the fact that the clause is expiring without anyone bothering to activate it should tell you that the market is not interested in paying more than 60mil. It's blatantly obvious that Leipzig have been playing games in media with the constant ""remember Olmo has a 60mil release clause! activate it or someone else might do it!"" and no one has taken the bait. They're not actually interested in keeping the player, they're interested in selling him. Yeah, thats the point. They want to keep him, therefor they will now be asking for a higher price to ensure he stays. They dont want to sell him. I think you didn't understand what I was saying. Leipzig might pretend like they want to keep Olmo, but they don't. They want to sell him. But agree to disagree I guess."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* They have all these great players with high value playing in the middle third and wings, but they could only produce a forward with a measly 30m? Damn didn't know Onana was from La Masia. 40m Balde, 30 mil Cucurella if anyone's curious.  Would've thought Balde would be at least a bit higher. Something tells me if a team came and bid ‚Ç¨120m for Yamal, Barca would not be like yeah fair, deal. In reality his value is surely much more than that Instead of buying Fort could we simply not just build one? Messi has been free transferred 3 times now. Why put a 30 mil tag, put 0 mil instead, my man's priceless! Still rooting for Ansu to make it back onto this list. Hold up, I did not know Grimaldo was **that** Grimaldo, wtf! Lost track of him when he left for Benifica. Dude pops up in this all winning Bayer Leverkusen team with beard/goatee and shit, I didn‚Äôt even realize. It‚Äôs been so long ago. Hold on a sec ..Onana is from La Masia??? TIL olmo was la masia  Edit: grammar La masia doesn't produce strikers, the only one i can think of is Bojan One of them is not like the others And none of them come close to the mighty like Isaac Cuenca and Tello Where is Pedri? Come back Grimaldo, finish the job! Fermin and Cubarsi are not 30M value, they are at least 60 each tbh. only 30m for a striker? La Masia is cookedüò≠ IMO it should take their highest estimated transfer value rather than their current market value. Messi 8 years ago would be way above 200 million.  Also, if we are allowed to consider retired players, I would replace Eric Garcia with Puyol, whose highest transfer value was estimated to be on the 30 million. So some people would have been surprised by seeing Onana in the XI. Yeah! He's from la masia. forgot onana was a former barca academy Onana was at La Masia? Man forgot everything he learned then Cucurella? What do they feed these kids Alex Balde is way more valuable then Alex Grimaldo or Fort even combined. Balde is arguably Barca¬¥s best back since Alves which says alot that Barca have not have had a RB or LB at that level since Alves, Alba or Abidal.  There is no way anyone would sell Balde lower then 90m euros currently. He is young, fastest Player not only in La Liga but in Europe. He is the only player who can beat Kylian Mbappe in a race but alot of people don¬¥t notice his speed because he is skilled and La Masia schooled Is there an all time most valuable La Masia XI at their prime? Pedri? onana from la masia !!!!! poor man united Oh yeah Pedri isn‚Äôt from La Masia Todibo? Onana üò≥ guess there are exceptions everywhere Isn't Eric Garcia from Manchester City's youth ranks? man, market values have become so ridiculous inflatet the last 10 years Trying to sneak in Onana, like we wouldn‚Äôt notice!üíÄ Where‚Äôs Pedri? Did he not come through La Masia? Does Barca claim credit for players who joined as teenagers? Seems pretty disrespectful to the academies they came from. 90M for Gavi LMAO  And 80M for Simmons  Alright man Gavi at 90M‚Ç¨ is a disgrace to football Gavi 90M wtf [deleted] Although Onana, Gavi, Dani Olmo, Ferm√≠n L√≥pez, Grimaldo, Cubarsi, all played in La Masia for some period of time, weren‚Äôt all of these players actually transferred to Barcelona at around 15 years of age? Or am I missing something here? No one is paying 90M for damn Gavi Wonder if Cubarsi will be on sale soon   He‚Äôd be a steal for any side given his talent and Barca‚Äôs consistent money issues could mean he‚Äôs a viable target for other clubs 90m for gavi? 90mil for Gavi wow. soooo overrated, mayb like 30-50 max ikr, not to mention the dude is in MLS, can't they find anyone better there? Spain in general has not been great at producing forwards for the last decade or so. Even before, actually, with some famous exceptions, of course. and i don‚Äôt really understand what that guy done to be valued at 30m. he‚Äôs 36 years old in the MLS and been injured for suite a while That‚Äôs pretty much Spain in a nutshell lol [deleted] Another obscure name would be Icardi He came from Samuel Eto'o academy in Cameroon, which was the best case scenario I guess, but was part of the plan (it also happened to Dongou and Ondoa). I'm sure Barca is looking at all these guys, it's hard for me to find precise info online, but in interviews Eto'o brags that most of the Cameroon national team played in his academy there. One of the players that gave Barcelona a long transfer ban. He does have La Masia dna when I look at him that ball playing ability is so Peter Schmeichel and looks barca coded From La Masia to bossing central midfield at Villa Park. It‚Äôs been a hell of a journey. He was almost 15 and then sent on loan a year or two later.   Edit: A hilariously delicate bunch to be bothered by this statement His injury set him back was gone half of the season I don't quite follow Chelsea's games, but Cucurella seemed to have decent performance in the euro cup? The same is true for many of these players.  $30m for Cubarsi? There's not a chance in hell. Same for Fermin. He had 11 goals as a midfielder last year for us, and then killed it at the Olympics. The release clause is there for a reason. PSG do your thing I dare you. That's super obvious lol.  Cubarsi might be even funnier. Dude is kinda already a stalwart of the La Liga leaders and one of the world's richest clubs AT SEVENTEEN. Like what is this ""30 million"" supposed to mean lol. You give Barca 30 million fee and they think ""ok that's worth getting rid of Cubarsi"" lol? Clubs would rather sign Andre Onana than Cubarsi?  Everyone agrees that the Transfermarkt number is not actually what the transfer fee would be in our reality today if that happened. Even with some biggest stars there are many examples where really EVERY fan knows that's not what the number says in the case, so I'm not even stating any opinion here. Nobody really can tell what the number IS precisely... it's the Transfermarkt number. There clearly is a ""smoothing function"" from transfermarkt. They never have what someone would pay for players that have been increasing. Some kind of institutional slowness // they dont want to look like they 'got it wrong' previously.  Because peoples values are much more volatile than they say for sure. Barcelona rejected 220 mln bid for Yamal from Psg before the Euro , not sure how his price is 120 mln. 3 times? Barca -> PSG and PSG -> Miami. What was the third, La Masia -> Barca proper? [deleted] He‚Äôs close to playing some matches under Flick, who will hopefully build some strength and conditioning for Ansu. Yeah, he was with us for 7 years I knew Grimaldo was from Barcelona, what I didn't understand is why no one signed him from Benfica until Leverkusen came. So weird. I swear there was always the rumour Barca would *finally* re-sign him until Balde came through lol He was always on the radar I'd say. I never got why he is playing for Benfica. He was so good. I mean, ok, I guess he has a lot of weak and limited areas that the very top teams don't really like. Spanish team looked better with Cucurella than him, arguably, having given them both equal chances. But I used to think he could really be their Dani Alves. And there was always SOME talk maybe it's time he goes to Barca every summer, but it never materialized. Yeah it's a big reason he started for Ajax at such a young age. Fit our system perfectly. Cruijf <-> Cruijf. Onana joined from Eto'o Academy in Cameroon when he was 14. He actually played in Catalunya in his academy years (2010-15), before joining Ajax for 150k‚Ç¨. Icardi the good barcaforum.com times before /r/soccer got popular WOW, Isaac Cuenca is a name I haven't heard in a LONG time. I remember him playing under Pep in 2012. He was solid, but disappeared the year after when Villa came back from injury. Not La Masia, we signed him when he was 16 from Las Palmas. Las Palmas Not academy product, he joined from Las Palmas at age 17 or 18. That‚Äôs the thing Pedri is a gem Bar√ßa found in Canary Islands didn't go to barca till he was like 17 Cubarsi is worth 100M+, 17 year old who is already a standout defender for Barca and will for sure be Spain's starter soon aswell. There isn't a better CB talent out there Least biased flair. Yeah that‚Äôs a lot less interesting. I know what Barcas 08/09 lineup looks like.  More interesting to see how they could theoretically lineup right now had they kept everyone That would skew this pic in a different direction. You would have the usual suspects of Busi, Alba, Iniesta who are all still playing Messi right now would be close to half a billion. He is just went through a bidding war, and his value isn't remotely tied to his production.¬† Messi 8 years ago would be ~300m then. Peak Messi in  today's market would be ~500m easy. Then you'd have Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets, and Alba in the mix too. Arguably Pique as well. It would be a totally different team. Carles Puyol joined Barcelona when he was 17. Starts to go a bit outside what I would call a La Masia product. The football market has also been skewed after neymar's transfer suprised he's valued at 35m because he plays like a 5m keeper He's 30m Best fullback since Alba not Alves. Alba was world class and a top LB in his prime. Literally all of the players in this list that are still with us would be sold for atleast double the amount than what is projected (they are unsellable) Don't know why you are downvoting. Balde is rock solid on defense. Good luck getting a left back who is on Balde's level for less than what Grimaldi costs In few years - maybe. As for today he IS behind Grimaldo, with only speed to show. Was Alba not considered good? grimaldo is rly good 2011 Barcelona Would be interesting to see. I think bar 4-5 players the rest would be 100m+ if you consider today‚Äôs inflation. Las Palmas academy. We signed him at 16. He joined City FROM La Masia and then returned to Barcelona. he went from la masia to city, then back to barca. He is not. Nope. He was bought for 20M Fans do however reality is apparent players like pedri or araujo are rarely claimed as academy players. There are more people crying about barca fans saying araujo and pedri are from la masia than there are barca fans who actually call them la masians. Which player are you referring to? Which one from this lineup isn't La Masia and disrespectful to their original academy, whichever they might be? You're a fan of an artificially Russian mob propped up club and hate Barca but you don't have to make up lies. That seems pretty low when you see the likes of fucking Grealish and Rice costing over 100 million Euros, lol. If he hadn't spent the year out injured he'd be valued far higher. Gavi is phenomenal, one of the best CMs in the world before his injury. Definitely looked to have a higher ceiling as a player than Pedri, may not be as technically excellent (although he is damn brilliant technically anyway) but he's exceptionally well rounded and fits modern football like a glove. Pedri is not a La Masia graduate Pedri isn't from La Masia Onana when he was 13  Gavi when he was 10  Dani Olmo when he was 9  Fermin when he was 13  Grimaldo when he was 11  Cubarsi when he was 11 Looking at this thread, I am amused by the lengths someone will go and skew a definition to dumb down a club. Ain‚Äôt no way a Chelsea fan saying this üòÇ Boehly sure is Odd,considering you paid it for Mudryk,Caicedo,Enzo.But I agree,he won‚Äôt ever leave for 90m if he were to,cause his value is obviously higher People paid more than 100 million for the likes of fucking Grealish, rice, and antony lol. I always hear prem fans talk lime this but barca never sold a valuable player because of money issues. Barca will never sell their key players and for all barca players every other possible step to another club will be a downgrade too. So they wont want to leave either unless barca force them out which wont happen if they are key players It's crazy that to this day people still think Barca is in some desperate financial situation. The only time there was actual worry about the club's future was 2021. Barca isn't a prem team they don't sell their best for money He is very important to the playstyle as a ball playing CB, besides that, Barca avoids selling La Masia guys like a plague. More likely that Araujo or Kounde go for sale instead of Pau. Ok-Smoke some more crack. He hasn‚Äôt even made a match day squad for his MLS side since June, absolute bum. 2000s had Raul, Morientes, Torres, Villa. Then something happened and their best strikers last 15 years were Morata, Negredo and like Joselu or some other rando (Costa is Brazilian) They have Euro winner Morata. Marketing value. You can make a lot of money with the guy around Yeah him and Ronaldo have been having very small drops in value for a while now, at this point they should both be under 10 million but they're still at 30M and 15M... r/whoosh Hes the least Barca DNA player ever I‚Äôve read it in our sub a couple days ago and I still forgor lol He just turned 14 and was there for 5 years Almost 15 means 14. He was La Masia. Say what you want about him, but he was the deciding factor in their game against Germany.¬† He‚Äòs definitiely worth more than 30m. Last season he started quite bad but became one of the most important players towards the end. Depends also when the last update was made at transfermarkt. Very good player just looks clumsy doing it and was bad to start in a meme chelsea team so everyone underrates his last 8 plus months of great play I wouldn‚Äôt even take double that for Cubarsi. His actual value is somewhere between 60-80M. Yea, a realistic ""valuation"" for Cubarsi is something like 150 millions  There's no way Barcelona would sell him for any reasonable price. He can be their homegrown star for the next 15+ years. That alone is worth 100 million. And the rest is player quality.  Transfermarkt is decent for random 24 year old players shuffling between Portugal, Turkey, and Italy. But when it comes to these more complicated players its meaningless. Nah this is estimated value, his release clause is 1 Billion Someone decided to use a currency function as a metric of a player‚Äôs value. In reality, circumstances skew this number greatly.  I think a rating out of 100 is far better, the way video games do it. That way, while Cubarsi may be super valuable for Barca, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he‚Äôs equally valuable to other teams (e.g. Barca would sell him if they get 100 million, but no one values him at 100 million) but it can be universally agreed that his skillset puts him at 82/100 (which even that is quite relative) Newells to barca r/whoosh Send him back to Brighton. No one predicted the injury crisis some teams would go through last year in England and I think that affected his growth Brighton were getting dispatched left right and centre for a while I swear there was rumours of him leaving Portugal for like 5 of those years üòÇ Grimaldo isn't from Barcelona, he is actually from Valencia and played in Valencia's academy when he was a kid, and he joined Barcelona when he was 12 Imagine it would be amazing. Ajax and Barca holding hands together with the trophy Two of those years were academy years. The rest were playing professionally and on loan. He was a winger turned into a false 9 like Messi but he ended up staying as one when Messi didn‚Äôt like it 16 Yeah obviously Cubarsi has a very small sample size to show, but if he continues playing at this level for an extended period he'll be a household name very soon.   If he keeps improving he'll be a legend. The kid's composure and passing range are incredible Also one of the best ball-playing defenders in the world already, definitely top 3. Olympic winners being starters at Bar√ßa at 17 and 19 yo and if you watch them play and their stats you would know it. Cubarsi is the best ball playing CB in the world right now. What price would you put on a kid doing what he does? MSN Barcelona in 2015 is probably the most valuable by combined inflation adjusted value While I agree that making a lineup with the active and younger players from La Masia is more interesting this post is an XI with the most valuable players.  And it would not be necessarily the 08/09 lineup.  Either Xavi or Iniesta would be left out as at least in Transfermartk their value never exceeded the 80 millions, which means Gavi is pretty much set on stone.  The MC by total transfer value  would probably be Xavi-Busquets-Gavi Old washed up Messi turned down ‚Ç¨1.5b over three years. Prime Messi is worth a lot more than that.¬† Neymar went to PSG for $200m 7 years ago. Messi 8 years ago would be worth $500m+. Players in those days weren't how 17 years old are now. Before Barcelona he played as a goalkeeper, and when recieved a shoulder injury, he trained as a striker.   It was with Barcelona that he was played and trained as a CB for the very first time. Would be insane to not call him a La Masia product. Especially when he spent as many years there as his previous academy. Good thing to know the club officially recognises him as La Masia opposed to your view then. Playing in the then C team is equivalent to playing in Juvenil A today which is the step under Barca Athletic where players like Araujo came through and are not considered Masia products. Yeah. But his performance with Inter was ultimate. The downfall in united is unexpected tbh. probably top 2 or 3 in his prime tbf Cubarsi is 3 or 4 times his flair to consider it. No way he is behind and they are not on same level Balde is tier 1 of world class players. He is gonna be vital for barca if he avoids injuries. Barca is so much better when he is around Balde is already a far superior dribbler and very solid in defence. His crossing used to be a weakness but he has worked on that over the past year. Alba was like 10x the player Balde is. Even now he's better. Balde is good for his age for sure, but he's gonna need some years to get close to Alba. Just the entire team I didn't know that, thanks for the info Wow, today I learned Yeah no one has said that Araujo and Pedri are La Masia products. To me, they must be younger than 15 to really be developed at La Masia, any older and they were developed elsewhere and signed to the club. Onana, Grimaldo, Lopez (I think came from the Betis academy?) - I have no idea how old the rest were. You're a delicate bunch, eh? Antony I‚Äôm sorry but as an avid Barca fan, it is clear to me that Pedri is far more gifted than Gavi. Yes Gavi may have more passion but Pedri has undisputedly been a stater for Barcelona since he arrived at 17. Not to take away from Gavi‚Äôs potential, but it‚Äôs more of a testament to Pedris ability Yea that‚Äôs what I mean, they were brought up by other clubs and Barca took them in and developed them and then they moved on a few years later. I don‚Äôt see them as ‚ÄúLa Masia products‚Äù like Puyol. I agree that maybe some of them are La Masia graduates in some form, but not products of La Masia. And also, I think gavi were 11 when he joined Cubarsi was not born in the middle of Camp Tito Vilanova, is he even a Masia product? I am more amused by the lengths a fanbase will go to take credit stating that players are ‚Äúfrom La Masia‚Äù when they clearly are not Uhhh, the only thing being skewed here is the definition of academy product. These are all La Masia graduates because that's where they were in the last year before they signed professional contracts but spending 2 years there hardly equates to being ""formed"" by that academy.  The delicacy of fans discussing this is genuinely hilarious. Except for city, Pep will do wonders with someone like Pau, Lamine, Gavi, etc They literally operating on future revenues and still run up against player registration issues. How is that crazy? You have got to he kidding me. Kounde is your best player at the back for 2 years now. I'll pitch in with some names from those randos   From the 2000s, they also have:    - Diego Tristan    - Ismael Urzaiz    - Last part of Alfonso   Then:    - Nolito    - Iago Aspas    - Fernando Llorente    - Gerard Moreno    - Aritz Aduriz    - Paco Alcacer   - Pedro   - Roberto Soldado   - Dani Guiza   Edit: add Roberto Soldado and Dani Guiza as others have said. Honourable mention would be Jonathan Soriano and my favourite: Raul Tamudo How is everyone leaving Iago Aspas from these lists everywhere is beyond me. I'm no expert, but Imo, he's been consistently one of the best Spanish attackers for at least 10 or 12 years. If he'd been at better club he would've banged 20 to 30 goals a year for sure.  Edit: replied to the wrong comment Those are all good, but besides Villa and Raul they aren't of the caliber of the players that Spain has had in other positions. Spain has had multiple insane players in every position, and in striker they only really have those two Looking at the most successful strikers careers recently (Lewandowski, Benzema after Cristiano left, Mbappe, Ibrahimoviƒá, Haaland, lately Openda, Isak etc.), you gotta be a quite ""selfish"" to be really top at that position. All these guys could do more in the game but often resign from it to focus on hunting goals.  For example a lot of top strikers have disappointing national team results, although they do score goals for them of course, but the team doesn't seem to be overachieving that much due to that. I can think of it happening much less often with midfielders.  Even Morata (who spent the whole career in top clubs! He's arguably good!) could convince a lot more of fans if he was just more aggressive and confident in his approach to the game. He is tall, technically gifted and intelligent. But like many Spanish talents, he doesn't convert that much of that into goals.  Not surprised the Spanish style doesn't excel at getting precisely the best ""9"" in the world. If I think of some Spanish ""9"" that had a good game recently, I can only think of Ayoze Perez (who, iirc, was not raised as a center forward in Spain, and only moved there abroad?) and Asensio (who isn't even described as a CF although that's kinda where he played for PSG in the game and did well I guess). Since we're being serious, a serious reply would be that those values may be tied on a larger part to marketing value.  The impact they make for brand, for the club and/or league, like a dual player/ambassador. Adama Traore is also in contention He‚Äôs got that riqui puig dna Most random la masis player I mean he does randomly come deep as far as between our CBs and help build up lol. Oriol Romeu You forgor üíÄ He was on loan for half of that time. It makes no sense to name him as a La Masia product. That's pretty much what I said. I am not sure Balde would have the same level of performance as Cucurella, which makes me wonder why Balde is 10m more than him. I wouldn't _sell_ him for anything short of ""fuck you"" money because he's the perfect CB for Barcelona.  However on the open market he'd probably go for that much, yeah There seems to be confusion here, market value is more about how much the market would pay for a guy, not how much a club would be willing to sell him for. My local team could value their captain enough to want 400 million, but that ain‚Äôt his value because no one is paying that. PSG I triple dog dare you Isn't it 500 million until he is an adult Imagine PSG pays it‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è [deleted] This is what it is, idk why everyone thinks the number is what a transfer would be for, it‚Äôs what the market would pay for him. Any club could ask anything for their players, doesn‚Äôt matter if clubs won‚Äôt buy the guy, he isn‚Äôt worth that, he is worth what other clubs would be willing to pay.   I do think Transfermarkt is a bit limited and usually the numbers are kinda low. r/wooooshwith4os [deleted] I didn‚Äôt watch enough Brighton (or even a single game) to know if the fit was right, if he was being used in the right way, etc, so what do you think would be best for him? Sending him back out on loan or playing him in this system he grew up with? Oh, I'm sure it was every year. A fully grown 12 year old Lmao that's barca academy. He was in Valencia for less time than la Masia. Trying to say he isn't a la Masia product is insane Thank you Onana He literally just turned 17 and has yet to play a full season at club level. Hes a defender. He will need at least 1-2 seasons to prove his consistency before breaking 30M. But much don't you think? Neymar and Suarez aren‚Äôt from La Masia though. And Iniesta, Pique, Xavi and Busquets were more valuable when younger Which in turn would make it even less interesting because it would be nonsensical without adjusting the values for (football) inflation i assumed this was current market prices and he's been at united long enough but yeah Nah the club literally can't sell cubarsi , he is an actual la masia product who will not throw tantrums like some others. And will also accept a contract renewal. Onana is the only one I Can agree on, both Lopez and Grimaldo spent most of their youth in Barca Onana spent 5 years in the academy, Grimaldo spent 8 years at the club until he reached Bar√ßa B and Luis Enrique wouldn't promote him to the first team, Ferm√≠n spent 6 years at the academy. I think all of them spent long enough at the academy to consider them academy products, there's no need to have their mom give birth at the Camp Nou to be considered as such. All three of them joined at 13 or before 13, so they spent their teen years in La Masia. I don't know whether this is enough to consider them academy products, personally joining at 12-13 is were I would draw the line. It seems it's you who is triggered to see a La Masia lineup. Of course Gavi has been an undisputed starter since he was 17 (broke into the senior set up whilst still 16), Pedri signed for Barca at 17 and spent the year on loan back to Las Palmas in the 2nd division. He entered the first team squad at 18 the following year.  Pedri will always win the plaudits for his style, he's got that aura to watch. But Gavi is a far more complete package - Gavi is a right footed Bernardo Silva type midfielder. Pedri is more along the pathway of Iniesta, Ozil or De Bruyne where he's unbelievable at what he gives, but has shortcomings you need to account for tactically to get the best out of them. They are from La Mas√≠a, eventhough they were playing in other clubs before joining La Mas√≠a. You wouldnt consider Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez Blanco as La F√°brica product? Puyol joined Barcelona at the age of 17. Apparently not! u/mrpara is clearly a philosopher or something, setting us football fans straight. You must be born to FC Barcelona players, at FC Barcelona hospital, and be nepotism‚Äôd into the squad by signing your first contract to join La Masia immediately out of the womb. Only the players that do that may be La Masia made. Why do pl fanboys like you like lying so much? Using your logic, your beloved arsenal has never produced a single academy player ever. Shame your Russian blood money club has never produced a single academy player ever. Olmo joined Barca at 9, Cubarsi at 11, yamal at 7. Pl fanboys are hilarious. Well, city did try to sign Cubarsi from barcelona juvenil A, i think it was rumoured that it was basically done with city but xavi intervened.   [here is a reddit translation of an article by Mundo Deportivo posted on r/barca](https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/comments/1amoudm/how_the_management_prevented_pau_cubarsi_from/)  And  [the original article by MD(Spanish)](https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20240209/1002186423/asi-impidio-oscar-hernandez-cubarsi-fichase-city.html) every single club operates on future revenues, well except for those who are backed by entire fucking states. Yes I rate Kounde and Araujo over Pau, what‚Äôs that matter? I don‚Äôt want to lose any of the three. Just both of them are 8 years older than Pau, more likely to leave. A lot of class strikers there but most scratches the top for a short amount of time or never. Definitely consistently good in La Liga, just not Raul, Villa level. Can't forget Dani G√ºiza. Soldado too Good list, I'd maybe add Guiza for that one season where he got 27 with Mallorca, and maybe Soldado as he was quite good in Spain for Valencia. Not top tier players but good players certainly. Even Johnathan Soriano for those 5 years at Salzburg but he never really had a chance at the top level as he was a late bloomer so hard to factor him in. How you going to murder my boy Soldado Believe he went to liverpool and banged exactly 1 goal a year if I'm not mistaken Dunno, there's a common agreement he's great for a club like Celta, where no one asks him much and he plays without much pressure. He scores the occasional banger here and there and he's pretty constant at delivering.  But that's it, there's no more to it. He failed badly to stick with the national team. He also performed poorly and below his skill level at Sevilla (despite winning a title there) and went back to Celta, in his good years he averages 20+ goal+assists, and he even had a couple great years.  But being a forward, those numbers aren't impressive, never shined in big stages and he plays in a team that loves him and never puts any pressure on him.  So, while he's a very lovable dude, humble, charming and not a bad player at all... it's kinda hard to include him among the best. He's definitely close, tho, he just needed that one more thing. Torres was on their level for a couple seasons What are you on????  Morientes, Torres and Villa where fucking class for several seasons. Just because the bar has been set really high by Ronaldo and Messi, then we still need to take into context how they actually played. Some of your comments are getting downvoted but I feel like you are the only vocal person that has actually understood my point so thank you haha. Yeah I answered seriously because it seemed like an understandable complaint, I have been a regular user of transfermarkt for years and for a couple of them I even had an account where I proposed some values ‚Äã‚Äãfor Serie A (clearly all ignored), and the fact that they are still so high is clearly an exception that doesn't respect their own guidelines Adama played for Barca recently and it was pretty public he was ‚Äúreturning‚Äù so to speak but yes he would be less known than a lot of these guys Even scored a goal like that He forgor Being there for 2.5 years still makes you were a part of the academy. Plus, he was 19 when he joined Ajax, so he clearly spent prime development years at La Masia Balde is 6 years younger and has a higher ceiling. *""We broke the football economy on a Barca winger before, don't think we won't do it again!""* From memory that was Pau Cubars√¨ but I could be wrong about that, but a quick search turned up nothing about it for Lamine. The official statement on his new contract just said that the buyout was 1 Billion Yamal has to agree too lmao no They also don't do a good job with young players. Probably to avoid overreacting. Multiple clubs would be willing to pay significantly more than ‚Ç¨30m for Fermin or Cubarsi Rofl it's r/woooosh It‚Äôs r/wooooshwith4os Boy you‚Äôre a special one¬† r/wooooshwith4os r/wosh Actually i would let him sit with hansi flick for a year. But Brighton had plans and it was going well he scored some then they got hit with a nasty injury crisis which ended up changing his position and style of play to not get Brighton relegated or too low in the league which stunted his growth. It‚Äôs very rare a player comes into the prem and starts scoring as quickly as he did he adapted so naturally and was class on the ball Karl Malone has entered the chat. I said that he wasn't born in Barcelona If we offered him for ‚Ç¨30m right now Pep and Arteta would get into a fistfight in the parking lot trying to buy him. So what? None of that changes the fact that he‚Äôs been the best ball playing cb since January.   If Barca put him on the market for 30M he‚Äôd be gone in a second lol Have you watched him play? Literally a playmaker from CB  The only one with similar technical skill IMO is Laporte He genuinely might be. The strong patch of football at the end of last year was directly correlated with his emergence for us, because he would routinely break the press with 1 pass.  Short, medium, and long. He can put a ball over the top for a runner, he can drop it to a midfielderer between the lines, or pass out of pressure near his own box.  I'd say among our backline he's the first name on the team sheet right now, because he provides something none of the others do.  Normally when you talk about a 17yr old CB, you talk about their potential, but the kid is doing it right now. He just needs to show that he can keep it up for an extended period. No. Honestly I‚Äôd put his performances on level with Yamal. He‚Äôs just a defender so he doesn‚Äôt get the same recognition.   There‚Äôs no defender who is close to his age, potential and skill set. Wouldn't ""most of their youth"" suggest they spent more time there than at other academies? Onana spent 2 years and the rest of the time on loan. Grimaldo spent 3 before joining Atletic (arrived in '08 started at Atletic in '11).  Edit: It's occurred to me that their fans are unaware that FC Barcelona Atl√®tic is the name for Barcelona B and that playing there means they've signed professional contracts. Grimaldo spend 8 years in Barcelona between 12 and 20 years old but for some people is not enough. Yes, that's totally the impression you're giving. /s Not a product of Real Madrid no, a graduate from the academy of course. But he‚Äôs not from Real Madrid, discovered by Real Madrid but not a product from the academy I really hit a nerve didn't I I didn‚Äôt specify myself, I was replying to the ‚Äú‚Ä¶and for all Bar√ßa players every other possible step to another club will be a downgrade too.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt agree with this part which is why I mentioned City is realistically the only option where a La Masia graduate would thrive. >every single club operates on future revenues  This nonsense in this subreddit sometimes cracks me up. Wild. You know what I agree. Morata has been very good for the national team and Torres is quite close to those 2 you mention but yeah I think that's it   And if we're talking about La Masia.. idk. Bojan Krkic? Lol 14 appearances at Liverpool, not exactly a large sample size.   He's class, and has been for most of his career , hitting good numbers at a club that is not expected to win the majority of their games. Villa too until that knee injury Torres peak > Villa or Raul peak. When he arrived in the Premier League, he felt similar to Haaland in terms of inevitability. Sadly that peak lasted 1 and a half seasons. 2.5 seasons of being world class is not on par with the others imo Morientes and Torres were not among the greatest strikers in hisory. I'm talking the level of Van Basten, Van Nistelrooy, R9, M√ºller etc Not saying he wasnt known to be from there.  Just saying his overall profile is not really Barcelona style Jammy time You're suggesting that Onana's ""prime development"" years are just the ages 14 and 15.  That makes no sense to me. Balde is solid defensively and in this market defensive fullbacks are rare Barca players aren't that dumb anymore to go and play in a league doesn't even have broadcasters and with clubs filing for bankruptcy. PSG and ligue1 is were players die . Gonna be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt go that much higher for a player that has like 20 something matches in first division football, as good as he may have been. Fermin has like 30 and is much older than Cubarsi.   Honestly 30 million sounds like a decent price for the players they are right now. Issue is, it‚Äôs too cheap of a gamble for clubs to pass on since they are so young, and too cheap for Barcelona to consider.   That‚Äôs one of the issues, there‚Äôs no way to even gage how promising a player is with that small of a sample of matches. Because any high fee is pure speculation. We‚Äôve all seen players at about this level stagnate or get worse, it‚Äôs common and normal. They could become top class players. Wait what , so I was always wrong?  Mandela effect? NGL I take the L here. That‚Äôs exactly how he came into the first team, scoring at will. He really is a force to be reckoned with when healthy. I truly wish him the best because seeing such a natural goalscoring winger is so rare. If you join a team at 13, you came through their academy. Academy doesn't stop at 8. Most of their youth suggests that its the academy theyve spent most time on, not that theyve spent more time there than every other academy combined. This is true for both Grimaldo and Fermin Brother what are you even talking about?  [https://www.transfermarkt.com/alejandro-grimaldo/profil/spieler/193082](https://www.transfermarkt.com/alejandro-grimaldo/profil/spieler/193082) This isnt true, just because he made some appearances for them doesnt mean he had joined them yet. Says you To be clear, are you saying if a player was with any club in their youth before their club that gave them their debut then said former club is not their development club?   So Yamal isn't La Masia but La Toretta's product and theirs only? And has someone said that all thise are complete products from La Mas√≠a. They are from La Mas√≠a and Ra√∫l is from La F√°brica. That's it. By that logic, your precious pl clubs have never produced any academy product ever. Your arrogance is what hit a nerve. They can always sell the entire club to foreign blood money.like chelsea have done to become relevant. Except Barca is already relevant without it. If that happens, you will probably become a fan then. how do you think a loan works? Madrid has more debt than Barcelona. then again you support a club which was ran by russian blood money and now an endless american billionaire, makes it a bit easier than being owned by the fans but oh well. not gonna expect an EPL fan to figure that some clubs have values.   FC Barcelona could sell itself to some bored American and buy the entire fucking Chelsea institution, so sit down. What‚Äôs wild? Torres is close to Raul and Villa?? Sometimes people underestimate how weather plays a crucial role in mood and getting comfortable at a club.   Going from Spain to Pool must have been a difference of day and night. I was too young to watch Raul at his peak but he was not better than Prime Villa. Villa had multiple seasons where he scored 20+ goals with Valencia & Zaragoza, and was far greater with the national team.  Premier league fans really overrate Torres. Atletico was perpetually mid table when he was there and then the first season he was gone, they were in CL position. It's nice when someone gives an such a whacky opinion that it allows you to discount every thought they have ever had. Well something obviously happened to him. But for those 2.5 years he was legitimately on a whole different level to the other two Van Nistelrooy is nowhere near the other three you mentioned. Yes, I agree. Not very tiki taka of a baller Never diss my favorite baby oil merchant bro And you're refusing to admit you were wrong. That makes even less sense to me. I'm guessing awb should be valuable then Potential and age is priced into the transfer value. That's why KdB's value is only ‚Ç¨50m.  But I think you're also not accounting for football inflation. Mohamed Simakan and Alessandro Buongiorno were CBs transfered for just over ‚Ç¨30m now. Joachim Anderson went for ‚Ç¨29.5  Age and potential aside, Cubarsi is already today playing better than any of them. This isn't a case of ""gamble on a promising player who will hopefully put it together"". If he just maintains his level without improving further he's already worth much more than ‚Ç¨30m.   Fermin is a different case since he's older and plays from the bench, but he also scored 11 goals for the club, and was Spain's best player at the Olympics. The underlying stats show that it's not a random purple patch of good finishing, he's just really good at getting into shooting positions and timing his runs from midfield. For a 21yr old CM with high work rate and decent technique the floor is already high, even if he doesn't continue improving. Not Mandela. That if for a large group of people. In this case, you were just wrong Yeah bro it's over for you ü§£üò≠ That's definitely not what ""most"" suggests but, regardless, that doesn't seem to jive for either of those players unless you're considering playing for Atletic, after they sign professional contracts, as time in the academy. Altetic is Barca B ... your transfermarkt link just verifies what I wrote above. Sure it is. You need to have signed a professional contract to play professional football and register the player. Signing a professional contract means you're no longer part of the academy. If he comes from another club he‚Äôs clearly from there, the other club and discovered by Barca. And also thank you for educating me on Yamal, I thought he was from La Masia Raul is not from La F√°brica exactly like all these players are not from La Masia. They are discovered by the mentioned academies, not from them >They can always sell the entire club to foreign blood money  The club is member owned. It can't be sold per Spanish law without first transitioning to an SAD and issuing shares. The club sold their future TV revenues to address it's financial issues. They didn't take a loan out against them.   >FC Barcelona could sell itself to some bored American and buy the entire fucking Chelsea institution, so sit down.  No it couldn't. It's not a privately owned club. You wanna double down on that famous Barca fragility some more? I imagine they mean Fernando Torres, not Ferran. And if that‚Äôs the case, he is absolutely there, his prime was the highest peak of the three probably. Legit he was a beast. Such a rough fall off tho No, but he is one of the greatest strikers of all time and better than Morientes and Torres People arguing over bragging rights for Onana makes even less sense to me. To teams who desire a solid defensive fullback? Absolutely Yeah I agree, inflation isn‚Äôt really accounted well there and it‚Äôs why I said their numbers can be low.   KDB is 50 because we know what‚Äôs gonna happen, he is gonna decline and has 3-5 years at top level in a hopefully steady decline, you are paying 50 million and big wages for a player that‚Äôs gonna give you at best 5 years. Young players are volatile and as good as they play now, they may become way better, stagnate, decline or fall of a cliff, at Barca you‚Äôve seen all of those I‚Äôm sure. And you may think they are too good now for whatever but I thought that about Dembele, about Naby Keita, about Gotze, Matias Fernandez, Alexandre Pato, Robinho, almost all were way better and more promising than both players being mentioned here, and pretty much all declined heavily from their best. You don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll be good and both of them have played very little to even begin to think anything.  Also Simakan went to the Saudi league and they overpay like crazy, same with Andersen in the Prem (and he was coming from being one of the best in Ligue 1). Boungiorno was really really good and tbh I don‚Äôt think he is obviously worse than Cubarsi.  So yeah they are gambles if you‚Äôre going for a player that has like a season of matches and for 60 million. Those are the riskiest. I swear most people replied with r/woosh whenever I saw it.  That's why I said it might be Mandela effect. Fermin spent 6 years in the youth and Grimaldo spent 4 before they became members in Barca B. Thats longer than theyve been In Any other club, I dont know why you are continuing this when you‚Äôre completely clueless Its really funny how your job in this threat is trying to convince people that Grimaldo and Onana arent from la Masia, they spend 2-3 years there. Grimaldo was with Barcelona between 2008 (12 years old) and 2016 but for some reason is not enough for you, its even funnier when you wrote ""when he signed for Atletic"" like is another team, when is Barcelona Atl√®tic or Bar√ßa B. And btw, Grimaldo is also a Valencia academy product, but that doesnt change the fact that is also a la Masia product. Not every player have to be in la Masia since they are 8 years to be considered an academy product like Yamal. My link absolutely doesn't verify what you said and the B team is literally the last step of formative football. Not only that, but you also show how clueless you are regarding ages in formative football in Spain, let me explain it to you.  The last step before joining the first team at any club (or the B team, which can include senior players) is Juvenil, where 16, 17 and 18-year-olds play. However, there is no need to complete the full 3 years, Grimaldo made the jump to the B team after his second year as a Juvenil, Lamine, for example, skipped Juvenil and went straight to the first team from Cadete. How does skipping years of formative football diminish your status as an academy product simply because you are ready for a higher level?  In any case, there is no such thing as ""signing for Atl√®tic"", as your original comment said before you edited it. It is all part of the club and the last step of the pipeline. Keep your condescension to yourself.  Ets un ruc i no tens la m√©s petita idea de com funciona el futbol base aqu√≠, ets canadenc i del Chelsea. No you dont If you are a youth player belonging to the club, give me a single source saying he signed his contract 2011. He came to La Masia when he was 7 years old, my guy... I am just confused that there is a person on the planet with this take. Even the given clubs wouldn't agree with you here. Nor would the fans of those clubs. Lol Barto was already planning to. So is Laporta's rival Font. Of course it will never happen cause the fans will probably riot. It is genuinely mind boggling how the more I read into this thread, the more comments from you spewing uninformed garbage I see. Barcelona could absolutely sell its property to a billionaire, investment group or whatever garbage PL clubs have sold their property to over the last 20 years. It would simply have to be agreed upon through a referendum in which socios would have to sanction the sale, which will never happen because there is no need to do such thing.  Go sell a hotel to bypass FFP regulations or something. What people don't understand is that FC Barcelona is FILTHY RICH. It's one of the biggest clubs in the world and the new stadium is on track to open next year with 100k+ seating capacity.   The club is rich. ITS HUGE   Selling a portion of the tv revenue doesn't mean shit ""he is one of the greatest strikers of all time""  No he is not, and Torres and Morientes are closet to Van Nistelrooy than Van Nistelrooy is to Muller, Van Basten and R9. Pato would go for ‚Ç¨100m today. Dembele _did_ go for ‚Ç¨100m a few years ago.  Big teams are willing to take the gamble because hitting on a Sergio Ramos or a Neymar is worth the risk to them. What's funny is the lack of knowledge Barca fans have about their own club. I don't have a ""job"" here, I disagree with the idea that a player is ""formed by La Masia"" after spending 2 years there and the oversensitivity to that is hilarious. >My link absolutely doesn't verify what you said   It shows the move to Atletic (it also debunks your laughable claim that Grimaldo spent 8 years at La Masia.)   >and the B team is literally the last step of formative football.¬†  Barca Atletic is a professional football team and playing for it requires a professional contract as is the case with all clubs in the same division. Signing a professional contract is, by definition, the end of your academic time with your club.   >In any case, there is no such thing as ""signing for Atl√®tic"", as your original comment said before you edited it.  Uhh, I wrote ""joining"" ya delicate weirdo but signing works here as well. A move to Atletic is *a loan signing*. It's association with Barca does not change that it is a different club with it's own player registration. Per FIFA you can not go on loan without a professional contract.  I'm a Canadian who used to live in London and support the same club as my family you melt. That you need to go searching through past comments because I disagree with you is just plain pathetic.   If you signed as a teenager you are not ""formed by La Masia"". That would be like me claiming Christensen or Ake as ""made in cobham."" You cannot play professional football without a professional contract. The club can‚Äôt register the player otherwise. That‚Äôs the rule for both FIFA and La Liga, who regulates the professional divisions, in Spain.  It‚Äôs also the case under EU and Spanish employment law. I know that now thank you. You say it your self ‚Äúhe came to‚Äù there for he‚Äôs not from, my guy‚Ä¶ I'd hope you're right but I'm sure some are dumb enough to support it. We've got Chelsea fans cheering on the mess the new owners created and losing it on anyone who's critical of them. >Barcelona could absolutely sell its property to a billionaire  Of course, but the comment I responded to suggested *the club itself* could be sold not some of *it's property* (something it has and will continue to do.) I get that I've triggered something in your over-senstive ass but, ffs, just read first. Socio's can't sanction a sale either they can only sanction a transition to an SAD and from there the decision is left to the shareholders.  >Go sell a hotel to bypass FFP regulations or something.  The sale of fixed as assets is not recognised as revenue for FFP purposes. The hotel was transferred so the owners could continue to extract value from the club. You're a deep well of petty nonsense.   Maybe don't follow me around and you won't need to be so bothered. I don't really agree tbh. Torres had too short of a prime, he only managed 1 season in his career with 20+ league goals, Ruud had every season except 2 with 20+ league goals from 98 to 07 and in those 2 seasons he missed he combined for a total of 27 games played as he was injured a lot.   Morientes just wasn't that good to even be included in this conversation. He was good in the big games but his goalscoring record is far below. Van Nistelrooy was closer to the top top than he was to those guys.  You say he's nowhere near Van Basten but his record for the Netherlands is better, more goals per game while also playing in more games and that doesn't even factor the fact that Van Basten was forced to retire in his prime rather than having the latter part of his career drag down the averages as he aged. It doesn't mean he's better of course, I still think Van Basten was better but it does mean that he isn't ""nowhere near"". The dissrespect. 6th cl topscorer of all time btw Listen, you've been arguing with people here all day, so you've got me beat in being pathetic, I believe.  It is obvious you are absolutely clueless on the topic you are arguing about, so I won't drag this any longer. Grimaldo joined the club as a 12 year old, spent 5 years in the youth levels and made the jump to the B team where he spent 3 and a half years and left as a 20 year old, after 8 years at the club.  Since you are mentioning FIFA, you might want to check whether Grimaldo would be considered an academy product of Barcelona following their standards (spoilter: he does).     Here's an article in Spanish on Leverkusen's website, where they refer to him as a La Masia product:  [https://www.bayer04.de/es-es/news/bayer04/alejandro-grimaldo-de-la-masia-a-internacional-absoluto-en-leverkusen](https://www.bayer04.de/es-es/news/bayer04/alejandro-grimaldo-de-la-masia-a-internacional-absoluto-en-leverkusen)  And here's an article from before the Euro's where he discusses his time at La Masia:  [https://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/futbol/20240614/9730604/alejandro-grimaldo-espana-eurocopa-entrevista.html](https://www.lavanguardia.com/deportes/futbol/20240614/9730604/alejandro-grimaldo-espana-eurocopa-entrevista.html)  Someone should probably warn him that there's a loser on reddit who, against his own opinion, does not consider him to be from La Masia. You probably shouldn't hold such strong opinions on topics you know nothing about, it makes you look like a knobhead. Gavi and a lot of our youngsters played with a youth contract to begin with so thats wrong No player is born in La Masia. They do ""come to"" La Masia at some point in their lives, yes, good job in figuring that out. You literally can't join at an age earlier than that, all players will have played at least for some small local team at some point before joining a professional club. You don't go from not having ever played football to a professional team's academy right away. So you're saying the likes of Arsenal have no academy product in history. I agree with you, Ruud is very underrated. He was inevitable in front of goal for a good 5-10 years. And Thomas Muller is the 8th top scorer of all time while Suarez and R9 are not even on the top 20.  Van Nistlelrooy was an excellent player, the top league scorer several times, but even then he is 2 tiers below the ""greatest strikers of all time"". He played on good teams that is correct I suppose if you're going to consider time after becoming professional and into adulthood as being part of the academy you've got something. Why not just refer to the entire club as La Masia at that point?  I have no idea why you're sharing this interview? His comments about La Masia are like an after thought and he references it being hard to be away from family.  >Since you are mentioning FIFA, you might want to check whether Grimaldo would be considered an academy product of Barcelona following their standards.  lol FIFA doesn't have a ""standard"" for what makes someone an ""academy product"".  No one's claiming these players didn't spend time or learn anything at La Masia. I'm taking issue with the idea that they're ""formed"" entirely by La Masia as if academies they spent more time in don't mean anything. That you lot can't read that without taking it personally isn't my concern. Nope. Gavi seems to have signed his first professional contract in September of 2020 and played his first match for Atletic in February of 2021.   The law says you can't have people work for you without paying them and the sporting regulations say you can't register a player without a professional contract  There's no such thing as a youth contract. That's a colloquial term like ""pre-contract"" for when a youth player makes an unenforceable promise to sign a professional contract. No ones born there, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs possible to not play in another club except the club you‚Äôre from. Like Gerrard didn‚Äôt play for another team than Liverpool, like Gary Neville didn‚Äôt play for another team than man united, good luck trying to figuring that out. You keep imagining your self that, whatever floats your boat gang gang Since you won't take FIFA's consideration on the matter, maybe UEFA's is enough to prove to you that you are wrong?  [https://documents.uefa.com/r/Regulations-of-the-UEFA-Champions-League-2024/25/Article-31-Player-lists-Online](https://documents.uefa.com/r/Regulations-of-the-UEFA-Champions-League-2024/25/Article-31-Player-lists-Online)  Maybe if you could read better you could've avoided a few hours of arguing with everyone online.  I'll be blocking you since you are not providing anything of value to this, you seem determined to deny any points proving you wrong and I won't be wasting any more time. Denying that a kid who joined a club at 12 years old and left at 20 is not an academy product is a weird hill to die on, but you can keep arguing alone if you will. You could just look it up on wikipedia or something before saying this stuff >Steven George Gerrard was born on 30 May 1980, in Whiston, Merseyside, England, and is the second son of Paul and Julie Ann Gerrard.[3][4][5] He started out playing for his hometown team, Whiston Juniors, where he was noticed by Liverpool scouts; he joined the Liverpool Academy in 1989 aged nine. You‚Äôre one dense individual¬† What? >Since you won't take FIFA's consideration on the matter,  You mean since I won't take something you pulled out of your ass?   You're sharing a document that has nothing to do with this discussion. UEFA's player registration rules has nothing to do with academies. Being ""club trained"" starts when they're 15, ffs, and any decent player will sign a professional contract at 16.  >I'll be blocking you  lol You keep replying to me and are getting annoyed that I reply back. It's bloody hilarious. You know you can just not respond, right? No need to be upset just because there's people who disagree with you. Then I am admitting I was wrong about Steven gerrard, thank you for educating me on gerrard >You mean since I won't take something you pulled out of your ass?  Funny that's coming from someone who has been unable to provide a single thing to back up their claim that Grimaldo should not be considered an academy product.  LMAO have a good one little man. You are wrong about the concept in general, how do you think the whole thing works, huge clubs just go around signing random kids who have never played football in their lives? According to a quick google search neville joined manchester united when he was 16, you think he had never played football before then? IDK there is such large amount of footballers that it probably has happened at some point but it's not at all the ordinary. lol You‚Äôve let me down here. I was told I would be blocked. Let me make this easy for you and block you myself. ""okay"""
"[Plettenburg] FC Bayern are trying to sign both, D√©sir√© Dou√© and Xavi SImons If one of the transfers doesn't work out, or both, then Bayern are considering further steps regarding Dani Olmo if possible","2024-07-16T16:07:42+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e4sial/plettenburg_fc_bayern_are_trying_to_sign_both/","[No textual content]","171","ZaBlancJake","https://x.com/Plettigoal/status/1813234333445923123"," To reduce the spam of reports regarding the same move during transfer windows we try to allow **only one submission about each transfer saga per day**.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* What not winning the league does to a mfer Why do Bayern need Musiala, Olise, and then 2 out of Xavi/Doue/Olmo? All these guys very much occupy the same spaces in that inbetween zone, none are classic wide wingers or proper central midfielders. Bizarre squad planning, especially when you add on the fact that Kane likes dropping deep into the same zone. They should be looking at some actual pacy wingers who stretch defences if they want to move on from Coman and Sane I know some of these players are positionally flexible but the overlap in profiles seem so excessive for Bayern that I think Olmo makes more sense than having ALL of Dou√©, Simons, Musiala etc. Secondary vs primary positions and minutes and that.  Granted I dont know shit in comparison to the people in charge but I do think Bayern are beinga bit excessive in this sense. Olmo to replace KDB at City, calling it now.  (Not saying he's as good as KDB, but i have a feeling he's the one they'll buy if KDB goes to Saudi.) I use to be a big Dani Olmo doubter but not anymore and far from in fact now I think Dani Olmo is one of the best in the world in his position. Dayum that is drastic change in view.  The guy is relentless, fearless, technically sharp as a knife, and he is a fighter. You gotta take the bastard entirely out of the game to take him out or he just keeps coming. All in All I can¬¥t heap any more praise on Dani Olmo as I would run out of words Why isn‚Äôt everyone rushing over Simons? He‚Äôs legit With that absolute monster Euro, i don't know why Olmo isn't their main target right now Harry Kane is never winning a trophy god damn why dont they fuck off from our ass again 2 leipzig players, eh? (yes, I know xavi is only loaned)  but we buy 2 from stuttgart and we get shit on lmao I don't think even winning the league would be enough to save Kompany if he can't perform in the Champions League, especially now that Munich is going to host the final next year. Is that really as crazy as you make it out to be?  Most likely they are alreayd planning around a system kompany wants, which presumably would have at least three of these players starting. 4 top players for 3 starting positions is commonplace. There is also the possibility that all 4 of these players would start (or three and sane, with the 4th on the bench), as theres been reports that simons will play in midfield behind musiala. That would allow two of the others to play on the wings Musiala is very comfortable on the wings so if Simons came he will play at 10,they could switch within the game depending on the circumstances. I don't know what the plan with Dou√© will be if he came, I don't think he would be a starter. My worst fear is that Bayern is trying to sign both because they think Musiala might not extend his contract. Olise too. Like he's a winger in name but his game is closer to that of a 10 This is Bayern, they overreact without planning He‚Äôd be my pick if I pulled the strings at City. Magnificent player that gives everything. Feel like that‚Äôs Wirtz if Pep stays or Xabi replaced Pep at City He's already owned by PSG who he left Barcelona for.  Outside of Bayern there really aren't many other clubs left who might attract him. Great tournament and phenomenal player, yeah, but he's got a pretty major history of injuries Because he missed 60+ games in the last three seasons Cause you don‚Äôt base your transfer policy on one single summer tournament. ¬†There are so many stories of players who make an extremely great showing in an international tournament only to be disappointing in their club career.¬† Youve been buying almost exclusively from other bundesliga clubs for years now. To be clear, i dont agree with any club getting hate for buying players, i think its stupid, and going to dortmund from a smaller BL club is just a logical move for a lot of players. But i think thats why Dortmund gets so much hate. It was bayern that was getting hate for it a few years ago and i didnt agree with it then either With how Leverkusen played last season we just can't take the league for granted anymore. We haven't won the DFB Pokal since the sextuple season. A CL win at home would be a dream come true, but I don't think we'll fire Kompany if we don't win it Yes it is as crazy. Obviously they can play an XI that features all/most of them, point is that would not be maximising the strengths of these guys and would leave the team looking imbalanced with clear deficiencies I think we're trying to sign both because we realised that it'll be very hard to get Wirtz next year and all of Gnabry, Coman and San√© are either too injury prone, inconsistent or both. Which is correct. After Davies transfer saga nothing is certain. Plus players can become worse too. And with the increasing number of games every top club needs 2 teams. They could be moving towards a more classic 4-2-3-1, where the players in the 3 band interchange positions more and almost act as three separate 10's, instead of having one 10 and 2 out-and-out wingers. What?¬† Flo is not a replacement for KDB. He is a needle player, that strives carrying the ball and playing through tight space, but his passing is miles from KDB.  Don't get me wrong, Wirtz is an amazing player, just an entirely different profile. in his younger days he was never injury prone, all of this happened after he played in the Euros and then immediately the Olympics in 2021, he just got overcooked and the muscle injuries came after that Fair enough I guess Morocco 2022 is the latest example with Amrabat and Ounahi you buy from leipzig for 5 years now Bayern playing as bad as last season also can‚Äôt be taken for granted Eh not really. Theres not one way to play football and perhaps kompany wont want to rely on pacy wingers. It think thats likely because all reports are that they want to absolutely dominate possession and rely on creativity. I dont think well be seeing much counterattacking anymore so pacy wingers might not be essential Like which teams? For me the pinnacle of that setup is 2012/13 treble Bayern, and they relied heavily on quick dynamic wingers Huh?  Nagelsmann too far in the past for you? Forget about the recent Tuchel fiascos? Not like replacements have identical attributes - Olmo seems more like a worse Wirtz than he does like a KDB clone  If I‚Äôm pep I fill the open 10/8 hybrid role that KDB plays in with Wirtz if the ginger fucks off to Saudi Seems like the case with a lot of Spanish midfielders. Is it overplaying? Yes but in dortmunds squad there is 13 signings from Bundesliga compared to bayerns 8 (and liverpools 9 and man citys 8 interestingly) Bayern's performance last season would have been good enough to win the league in the years before. It literally took a historical unbeaten run from Leverkusen to break Bayern's streak. You‚Äôre talking out of your ass. Lmao Valencia ca. 2009 with Silva, Mata and Hernandez Spanish NT, when they pretty much played 4 10s with Fabregas, Xavi, Iniesta, Silva.  Inter won the CL with Panda, Etoo & Snejder behind Milito. I actually didn't realize what you answerd to, fair point.  Olmo is worse offensively, but he contributes, much, much more defensively. PLaying Wirtz as a ""10/8 Hybrid"" has been tried by Leverkt wasn't straight up bad, but not impressive either. You do know they finished 3rd right? The seasons before the team realized the title with almost no effort. Last season Bayern was clearly the third best team in the league having no business to challenge for the title after that embarrassing display against Leverkusen. The season before they should have not won it aswell. We can praise Leverkusen all we want and Bayern could have been an honorable second but thats not how they presented themselves in the Bundesliga. And ito is also ‚Äútalking out of his ass‚Äù is he? As i assume you wouldnt know, ito is a new bayern player.  https://x.com/imiasanmia/status/1813144056861491643?s=46 i know his hairline is spotted af, but the autocorrect to panda is wild üíÄ He meant the point total. In the past 10 years, only Dortmund surpassed the 72 PTS Bayern had this year, they did it twice iirc.  Bayern won the league last year with 71 PTS. :D"

Those crazy sons of bitches did it. How tf was it so difficult to register 1 fucking player???   We lost G√ºndogan, Joao Felix, Cancelo, Faye, Sergi Roberto, Marc Guiu, Julian Araujo, Romeu, Marcos Alonso. Only a Barcelona transfer has suspense even after the transfer is complete. It's like VAR. Can't celebrate too early. It‚Äôs baffling to me that they had to unregister Christensen in order to register him. Like, they literally gave Gundo back to City for free just to get rid of his wages and it still wasn‚Äôt enough.   How fucked are Barcelona when they inevitably have to renew the contracts of their brilliant talents. Only had to get rid of Gundogan, Faye, Roque, Juli√°n Araujo then break Christensen's kneecaps for it to happen FYI for those confused why this has been so difficult despite releasing so many players, 1 we as a club are not yet back to ‚Äú1:1‚Äù meaning that removing wages only frees up a fraction of them and 2 in this window we have also had to register Lamine Yamal, Pau Cubars√¨, Marc Casado, Pablo Torre, and Pau Victor   Not excusing the disgusting mismanagement of the club by the criminally incompetent board, just providing some context. Also as far as I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs not necessarily that Christensen is unregistered per say, it‚Äôs just some financial fuckery from his injury giving us some space until the winter Yey It's so great to be barca fans there's another Asprilla? Well, the drama is kind of over for now. But isn't he registered cause Christensen got injured? So if they don't free up the money when he is back, wouldn't it be a problem? Chances for drama again if they don't return to 1:1. Other clubs have transfer sagas, Barca has register sagas. Well thank fuck, we can finally sleep at night. Normally the drama and constant transfer update bombardments stop after the player has signed, but Barca can spin out the tension a bit more with the question if they can be registered. Yay  Olmo Danika Why did I read BETRUG Can he play CB? Big news  This happens every transfer window lol For how many days ? [removed] Finally.. In time for the third game of the season lol üòÖ‚Ä¶ finally! Wait when did Girona get Yaser Asprilla? Asprilla to girona is the bigger deal on this list. so Vitor Roque goes to Betis No fun in that At this point Laporta and the board are simply fucking with media and fans with registering shenanigans. After everything it came down to Christiansen being injured lol Congrats to FC Barcelona for registering a player they signed. Big asterisk. If Christensen is healthy by December and haven't solved financial issues, Olmo can't play. too late Barca in the mud? Unfortunately i genuinely think Barca might crumble. Not just finishing out the top four but crumble. Yes i hate Barca but it feels wrong hoping for a club to eviscerate or lose its elite level after being what it was. If it was happening to Real i could be happy but any other club (other than City) i‚Äôd be quite sad  Even if it happened to Real actually i‚Äôd be quite sad , if it happened to any team in world football other than City i‚Äôd be sad. And he‚Äôll be absolutely vital for the half season he plays. Anyway, thanks for Gundogan back. Twice the fun for every transfer, you'll never sing that üòé Prepare for take off and there we land Make it 4 for the 2 they have to sell to register Lmao Who are they gonna register at the last minute next transfer window?  Find out on the next episode of Keeping Up with the Catalans. Doesn't this happen every season? There are reports that they can't register, but at the end of the window, they register their players. It only took them sacrificing players like Gundogan and Christensen to do it. Always do lol. But this was unprecedented, olmo missed two games which none of the previous new signing did. Kounde and folks missed just one game. Olmo‚Äôs registration woes was annoying because gundo left and even so, olmo couldn‚Äôt be registered.¬† Christensen was sacrificed for it tho lmao >son's of bitches  Amazing English. Its crazy. Gundogan, joao, cancelo and sergi roberto together should be like 700k+ euros a week freed up in wages.  Really dont understand why it would be such a struggle? Because Barca can only use a quarter of the wages freed up. they will get more money this year. you can improve the finances during the season, there's no deadline for that.  with that being said, they needed more money from deals and thus could not get closer to the 1:1 rule.  there were deals before the summer window but that was not enough. technically they have no money to reregister christensen in winter but if they manage to get a new deal (money in), it  can look promising for the winter window and next year obviously  either laporta was lying (which i think he was) or they got really unlucky because everything pointed towards the 1:1 rule.  also FDJ is the highest paid player in the top5 leagues... 700k is just crazy but it is what it is Because they had to fill a hole in terms of revenue/salary from last year which had been filled by deals that ended up falling through. [deleted] [deleted] >How fucked are Barcelona when they inevitably have to renew the contracts of their brilliant talents.  Barcelona needs the Camp Nou back. The club is losing a ton of income by playing in Montjouic. Christensen is not unregistered. They got an exception on his wages as he is injured. Until 31st December they are both registered, then they will need to find the money and space to register Olmo again. This is like the fifth time I see that disclose about Christensen being unregistered. Then, in the comment below, someone will rebute it. Both will be upvoted so you can‚Äôt even tell who‚Äôs wrong. Because someone has to be and whoever is, is spreading misinformation. At this point, is Christensen still registered (meaning that Olmo would have to be registered once the 1 of January clock it since he‚Äôs supposedly temporary registered) or he is not? This isn‚Äôt some sort of Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cat situation here. It's baffling to you because you're absolutely wrong, that's not how the rule works. Barcelona took advantage of Chris being injured, but whenever he's fit again, he'll be able to play alongside Olmo. Christensen wasn't unregistered so Olmo could be registered. Yes Only a certain % of freed wages can be used immediately I think. Madrid fan lying lmao.   Also your biggest fans 4:1 / 1:1 rule is the reason why gundo leaving wasn‚Äôt enough. This is exactly what happened for them to lose Messi - no way they have learnt their lession. [deleted] Faye and Julian Araujo were not first team players, their departures would not make a dent in the wage cap. Also ended the loans of Cancelo, Felix, Romeu. Sergi Roberto, Marcos Alonso also left Yaser, no relation to Tino That's right. The funny part is that if Christensen recovers before January he can still play together with Olmo on the pitch Would only be a problem to sort out in January. By then the club is expecting some revenue streams and one or two player departures. no, they can both play untill January. Then we have to sort out olmo's registration again which should be no problem as per the nike deal but you never know Have you been sleeping or something? Bar√ßa just returned from the brink of collapse and now are stronger than we've been in a long time. The Camp nou opens next season and the revenues are going to go up significantly in one go and it'll be more or less comfortable after returning 1:1 on wage caps and transfers. This sub certainly loves to hate on Barca, something to behold. Sure, the club is mismanaged, historically, and some of the board members are shady as hell. Yet other teams with crooked past or present don't get a fraction of the hate Mate your club is literally ran by another country, how sad is that? They get VAR checked in their books, twice the celebration. Van Dijk, you heard it here first And where will Dani Olmo end up after being forced out so that they can register the new signing last minute? Olmo again. This is an ""emergency registration"" like Braithwaite was. It wasnt even at the last minute, it was beyond that. He missed two games While thats true this time he did missed the first 2 games because he wasnt registered. It also happens to multiple teams but who is reading about Getafe. Since it all seems to be done very arbitrarily by the league, I honestly think Tebas just wants Barca to dance to his tune for a while so he can feel the power, but then he will allow it because anything else would be bad for the league. The calculations certainly appears to be bendable in any way they want judging by the previous cases. An injury = sacrifice? Lol Christensen wasn't sacrificed and only people who don't know the rule Barcelona took advantage of can say it. Whenever Chris gets fit again, he'll be able to play alongside Olmo, even if he comes back in a month or two. Gundogan was getting toxic for the squad, I'd rather fail with our youngsters than succeed with him moaning about kids to opponents in a friendly. [deleted] Truly! Thank you for notifying me! Deferred wages of Frenkie en Lewa are pretty hefty. Why is that? I had no idea FDJ was on such astronomical wages. Had to look it up because I was sure ‚Ç¨700k was inaccurate. Mama Mia, no wonder he refused to leave or renegotiate his contract¬† Don't know. Ask people who post this shit here. >¬†they just bought   probably because they signed this player over two weeks ago (for a hefty sum too) but he missed two matchdays because the club's finances didn't allow for him to actually play? the deadline is less than a week away too, i'd say it's newsworthy when a club is cutting it that close. No the point is, so much was freed up in wages and we still couldn‚Äôt register 1 fucking player. Make it make sense What does them breaking into the XI have to do with us being able to register Olmo lol.  What he‚Äôs saying is that our ability to register players was apparently even worse than we thought. And you sold off 30% (I think) of your tv rights for decades. Seems like the levers are coming back to bite Barca in the ass. I‚Äôm all for hating on our biggest rival but I‚Äôd really hate to see Barcelona implode. It will have a massive effect on the league as a whole.   I‚Äôm not even sure what your options are now. Selling off Yamal, Gavi and Cubarsi is clearly off the table for now but what if there comes a time when Barca has to let go off their future. Scary thoughts and even more so for Barca fans. > Barcelona needs the Camp Nou back.  That will not happen anytime soon. Wasn't it that when Christensen comes back before januari, then Olmo can't play anymore either. So Olmo is allowed to play as long as Christensen is injured. I understand. Still worrying, as they were only able to register him because a player got injured. He‚Äôs unregistered until the winter transfer window, even though he‚Äôs expected to be out less than 4 weeks it‚Äôs an awful move PR wise Christensen is still registered. It's a clause in FFP rules, that allows the club to sign a player if another player is injured for > 4 months. Means if he wasn't injured Barca would be restricted by FFP and would be unable to sign Olmo. You can literally find this on the website where the screenshot was taken Keep hoping son because that ain't happening It does increase their revenue though (which helps increasing their wage cap), which is the whole problem, their salary structure wasn't built thinking about financial sustanability and with the loss of revenue due to covid (which haven't still recovered from) they were caught with their pants down by this change that makes football clubs in Spain not going bankrupt every year. Wasn't Felix on peanuts anyway? Is it? Wouldn't they have to free some money for that? How can Christensen play if he's not registered? Is he going to be sent to the B team? Yeah most prolly. And the long speculated Nike deal is also not signed yet i think. Sorry. Messed up the month but you get my point. They are just postponing the problem. [deleted] How am I hating? üòÇüôè brutal Heard it here first.... and last If it‚Äôs not a 5 year contract with at least 20 mil euros a season, I don‚Äôt want him. Piss off? You freaking take that back Leipzig. And then on loan to Chelsea. Might as well just move the missus and kids to London and get a head start. if we don't win today maybe we should deregister Dani. 100% winrate without him If that were true Messi wouldn't have left¬† You never know what Laporta might have done. Wasn‚Äôt gundogan the most successful and complete footballer on that team last year? Feel like he‚Äôs got more titles than the entire team put together. Minus Lewy, of course. Is this a joke that I'm missing? No he wasn‚Äôt. He was signed as a free transfer last year. You guys are forgetting Messi‚Äôs deferred wages. His is at least 3x everyone else‚Äôs. I think they‚Äôll finally be done paying him in 2025.. La liga rules when clubs economies are in trouble. Hence the talk about 1:1 spending Sort of a punishment with heavier restrictions to incentivize you to go back to a healthier spending pattern, to avoid jumping from one debt to more debt and spiraling out of control. I don't know if you've been keeping up but your financial situation is dire That is just how bad your financial situation is. You‚Äôve reached the point where La Liga will only allow you to use 1/4 of the wages freed up its absolutely insane and its not even his fault in the end. its his money from prior season that was held back. just one bad decision after another from barca could be because you're the only big club who struggles on that front. Read the rules?  because unless they are first team players, they're not contributing to the salary cap, hence they're not decreasing the wage bill by leaving.  Edit: accidentally copied another comment at the start. 25% of domestic tv revenue is not even 10% of the clubs entire revenue I'm pretty sure it's 25% for 25 years tbh i think this is their lowest point, Nike deal is coming and even if they don‚Äôt recover from this in the next few years they can always sell Yamal or Cubarsi since their have a big market value (totally a thing Laporta can do) That's the part that is absolutely mental to me. It looks like if they took the hit for a few years and didn't sign anyone they would be fine but crippled themselves for 20-30 years instead I‚Äôm gonna sound like a dick - but I mean that‚Äôs just good business. If they sell Gavi, let‚Äôs say for ‚Ç¨120m - wouldn‚Äôt that literally be the huge windfall of money they need? Every other club in the world makes these sells, even Arsenal. You can‚Äôt have an amazing academy and then not use the side hustle that is developing players and selling on for pure profit   Edit: I forgot they got their stadium renovating project going on. Scratch this (unless the stadium doesn‚Äôt turn out enough money for them) It's projected to open at 60% capacity in Jan 2025 and be finished by the start of the 25/26 season The current plans expect to open at reduced capacity after the winter break, and to increase that capacity gradually for the following 12 months before completion. No, they're both registered provisionally until the winter market, at which point we need to have the FFP requirements to register both of them. If Christensen is healthy in a month they would both be able to play. Why reply to a comment saying he‚Äôs not unregistered to then comment erroneously that he has been unregistered. He has not been unregistered, you can literally look at the player registration to see that he hasn‚Äôt been unregistered. Sure, but those B team players were sold because they‚Äôre not good enough for the first team currently, not because they had to be sold. He was on something like 300,000; but Tebas decided he didn't like that, so in his books, the loan was costing us 3M Only after December. He is registered tho Tell me about it, people just love to hate here. We're doing pretty well for a club that is about to collapse. And when people here say collapse it's like the entire institution will vanish overnight into thin air and not get demoted or something (which has never happened and won't anytime soon) from where recovery is possible. Heck we won't be demoted even if we only started our la masia players for half the season. Well not if I say it again tomorrow and I swear I will just to vex you Better players have lowered their wages to play for us, besides he's 34 or soon to be so he isn't going to be maintaining that pay for long without going to Saudi. And lastly with camp nou opening up soon and we are returning to 1:1 that won't be much of a problem anyway. Nah mate it's the law, the Dutch pull is too strong No.¬† Alright alright, no reason to get your panties in a bunch... y'all can have your Dutch mountain troll, we already have our overpaid fragile Dutch high-elf (not to be confused with the high Dutch elf). 100% winrate with him now lol.  What a dilemma we find ourselves in... Messi was probably earning way too much to make room on the margins or fudge the numbers a bit. you cannot escape the levers His titles means nothing to Barca, he‚Äôs more complete in the attacking part of the game for sure. His defence? Eh. Kinda but he was also our ""best"" player last season because his availability. What I mean is compared to the other players his peak level wasnt really higher but he was the most consistent jus by being available as half the squad got pretty long term injuries (FDJ, Gavi,Pedri) while others were inconsistent(Lewa). >Wasn‚Äôt gundogan the most successful  Yess but does that make him less toxic and harmful to the cohesion of the squad?   >Feel like he‚Äôs got more titles than the entire team put together. Minus Lewy, of course  Yeah that tends to happen when the average age of the squad minus him and Lewa would nearly be half of his own. Also most of the kids have a higher trophy per game ratio if you really want to go there.... r/whoosh Do they really still pay him wages? The gift that keeps on giving! I was asking why only a quarter of the freed wages can be used, and not all of them. If you can answer that, please do, otherwise don't waffle random things. We still got rid of quite a few first team players though. Literally Gundo, Felix, Cancelo, Roberto, Romeu and Marcos Alonso were first team players.  Felix was supposedly on very low wages, but that's still a lot of players.  Only Guiu, Faye and Araujo weren't. More important. 75% revenue of 2nd place is still more than 100% of 3rd place.  As long as you asume that the investment keeps the team 1 spot higher than otherwise would be, It is good business. it's under 7% if we are talking about 2022-2023, but it allowed winning LaLiga that season which  is roughly the same. Sure, 2nd place is not that far financially I was just putting things in context Which is still a massive portion of their revenue.. 10% of the revenue of a club of the size of Barcelona is a metric ton of money. Sell Yamal lol. Can't imagine a worse idea. It wouldn't have worked. I think people forget how bad the situation was when Bartomeu left.  First, the new board had to immediately take a short-term loan to pay the wages of the players. The situation when they arrived was critical. Not being able to pay the wages would have forced to sell the club right away to open the possibility of getting a cash injection. Otherwise, the club could have been administratively relegated. That's also where all the fuss of the deferred wages comes from, as failing to pay the wages (without some form of agreement) to a single player, means automatic relegation. In addition, not being able to pay that short-term loan would have forced to sell the club and turn it to private ownership.  Then, Bar√ßa statutes mandate that a board that presents two consecutive terms of losses must resign and call for new elections. While the new board arrived halfway in the season, the losses of that season correspond to them. That meant that having operating losses on their first full season would have meant that the board had to resign less than a year and a half in charge. Without the levers, it was impossible for Bar√ßa to not have losses that year. Even with zero signings. The board was doomed the day they took charge. It was entirely possible that the next board would face the same problem, as they would once again inherit a club with high expenses and crippled income.  And then TV rights... the distribution in Spain is quite different from the distribution in the UK. 75% of the TV income of 2nd place is a bit more than 100% the TV income of the 3rd place. Strengthening the team to ensure at least 2nd place, while giving up 25% la Liga TV income, is more advantageous than just securing 3rd or 4th place.  Then there's the huge Camp Nou renovation, that had to be done asap. It really was a few years overdue. The Rosell/Bartomeu board should have done it. In some parts of the stadium there was already concerning structural wear and there was the risk that eventually some parts would need to be closed.  In my opinion, there wasn't a lot of space to maneuver. While what was done had mortgaged part of the club for two decades, I don't think there was a clear path to avoid it while keeping the club fan-owned. I don't think at the time Bar√ßa could afford 3-4 years of reduced income without entering a destructive spiral or selling the club. Even with this crippling we will still have more revenue than *insert pretty much any club in the world bar Real Madrid* every year. It‚Äôs hard because as soon as they do that then everyone knows they just got a huge windfall and Barca aren‚Äôt the best at negotiating lol What a nice turnaround of the FFP From what I understand only both can play if they have extra ffp margin when Christensen would be back from injury. So I guess Barcelona is hoping to have some deals finalised upcoming weeks/months. Clearly they had to be sold now so they could have a chance at increasing their revenue enough to they could register Olmo, in a better situation i think they would've just loaned Faye. Oh didn't know that. Saw a previous post saying that Olmo was to take Christensen's place in the squad and be provisionally registered till January. Barca is Schr√∂dinger's club. keeps doing well but is always on the verge of bankruptcy and relegation Sorry, Wont work, no vexxing me. As far as I see it, you're the proverbial 'here' so you'll technically have already said it and It'll just be coming from the same 'here' Wait, you're serious?  In the words of a /r/soccer legend, *diga um*.  I can't for the life of me remember of a world class player, arguably better than Van Dijk, who took a pay cut to join Barca, any time in the last say 15 years. Except maybe Dani Alves, but we don't talk about him any more. Tbf Gravy and Cody are freaking tall too lol Barcelona wanted to give him a percentage of ticket sales and percentage of tv revenue and not count that as salary. La Liga said no. Its Levering time.  Laporta before he took out Christiansen. You got me curious about the titles per game so I did some quick maths.  All Clubs + Senior NT games only. Added Fermin and Cubarsi the Olympic gold but didn't look at non senior NT games for anyone, if I had none would beat Gundogan  * Gundogan - 17 trophies in 615 games = 36.18 games per trophy  * Fermin - 2 trophies in 84 games =  42 games per trophy  * Pedri - 4 trophies in 206 games = 51.5 games per trophy  * Gavi - 3 trophies in 141 games = 47 games per trophy  * Cubarsi - 1 trophy in 27 games = 27 games per trophy  * Lamine - 2 trophies in 68 games = 34 games per trophy  * Balde - 2 trophies in 119 games = 59.5 games per trophy  * Ansu Fati - 4 trophies in 149 games = 37.25 games per trophy If that was a joke then it was a shit one and I don‚Äôt feel bad for having ‚Äúmissed‚Äù it. Yes lol Yes, Laporta confirmed they‚Äôre still paying him until 2025 Bartonomics Mate we're staring down a billion euro hole. If the finances are that dire La Liga FFP doesn't allow Barcelona to go 1:1 when freeing wages cause it won't help the financial situation.   Wages should be a certain percentage of income (60-70% I think?) True. Just not all the players mentioned in the original comment. It‚Äôs ‚Ç¨40m a year and will only go up.  Real Madrid and Barca both got ‚Ç¨155m tv money last year, Real kept all ‚Ç¨155m and Barca handed ‚Ç¨39m of it to Sixth street.  Using revenue % is stupid because the fact is football clubs usually run at break even or a tiny profit/loss. So yeah, ‚Ç¨40m is not huge out of total revenues of ‚Ç¨700m+ but when you‚Äôre only making ‚Ç¨11m profit last year and scraping the barrel to register new signings it‚Äôs pretty consequential. For FFP the difference between ‚Ç¨11m profit and ‚Ç¨50m profit is huge.  Theres a reason financially secure clubs in the PL aren‚Äôt making these deals. We didn't give it away for nothing if you will recall. It's a deal similar to one every other club bar Madrid and athletic club agreed to except ours is 25% and has a buy back clause you never know. in a few years if he continues like this and Barca doesn‚Äôt fix their shit he might want out Yeah but like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Barca lol. They can‚Äôt have it both ways. ‚ÄúWe have the highest revenue of all teams‚Äù only goes so far until you have absolute garbage management over the club. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre NOT sitting on a literal gold mine of young talented players to sell.   Any other team would be forced to sell, Barca refusing to do is putting them into a hole isn‚Äôt it?   If it‚Äôs not, then I‚Äôm happy to eat my words but literally how is that not the next logical move? I doubt it, Faye wasn‚Äôt even the best CB in the B team last season. Him being sold for 10m with a 25m buy back if he ever comes good + 30% sell-on clause is a very good deal.  We also currently have much better RB prospects than Julian Araujo. The league allows clubs to register an extra player if another one is injured for 4+ months.   That‚Äôs how Olmo is getting registered without unregistering Christensen. Barca absolutely makes a lot of questionable decisions but there's also so much misinformation and assumptions being made especially on this sub. People read a headline and make up a narrative and that becomes ""fact"" now. Anyone who thought Olmo wouldn't be registered is just taking the bait and I'm surprised people keep falling for these rumors. Yet has never been bankrupt or relegated or even finished outside top 4.... I think people like exaggerating for entertainment purposes but the management is truly shambolic. What if I ask my mate to do it instead? What if he lives a few thousand kilometres away? Gundogan? He even let go of his additional contract add ons That's just them Dutchies, some of the tallest men and women in Europe (third or fourth highest by nationality if I'm not mistaken). Thanks for doing the hard work, even though I stand corrected about the data but the point remains intact considering these kids carried a huge club on their backs in the worst financial era for the club this century while Gundo played for the club with the highest net spend and much much better squad with all well established world-class players with pep at the helm. So yes even though Gundo is one of the best centre mids of this generation but I'd still prefer squad cohesion than whatever toxic leadership skills he showed last season. Lol how is that even possible at a club like Barca? Bartomeu truly a Madrid legend I see. So different rules when clubs are in trouble. Not playing in the Camp Nou caused a loss of roughly 100 million last year. [Just the VIP section will generate 120m per year](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ecsq7m/barcelona_have_sold_95_of_9400_seats_in_the_newly/), and once the Espai Barca project is done, that's gonna be even more massive.  Also, Barca has a buyback clause for that 25%. Do you think the CVC deal for 50 years was better? Yeah because they're all privately owned you dolt. Financially secure clubs in the PL sold their clubs to be financially secure, Barca has yet to come to that FYI. They still have one of the highest revenues in the world. Once they‚Äôre back in their stadium their finances will be fine Ah now I get why we signed Olmo. He will probably be injured at the start of next season so we can register another player Then I will bow my head and concede to you my friend as you will no longer be the last. > Gundogan?  No, you must be misinformed...   Gundogan was on 8M EUR/year at City and arrived at 20M/year at Barca for a 1+1 year contract. Username does not check out the biggest difference is Madrid has a president that puts the club over any player, and didn't bow down to any ridic wage demands (ronaldo was shown the door for example) while Barca under Barto bent over for most of the players. I think all went apeshit with the COVID, they had to defer salaries. Can you imagine how long you had to defer Messi's? That shit was astronomical salary Messi would probably have a wage like that regardless of president. He would‚Äôve been at Barca after Laporta was elected if it weren‚Äôt for COVID putting them over the barrel. Yes the goal is to not let a club just try to outspend their income and bankrupt themselves. These people just need any reason to hate barca. They don't need a good one. A privately owned club is free to enter into the same deal as Barcelona. The reason they‚Äôre not is because it‚Äôs a bad deal. I FORGOT ABOUT THE STADIUM THING!!! Great point. Let‚Äôs hope for their sake it does work out - I completely agree, if a team has a stadium that they‚Äôre not using it‚Äôs not fair to look at their revenue without that. He‚Äôll get injured by January so Christensen can play. Insane 200 iq move by Laporta Infinite registration hack Concede a point? On Reddit? My dayss, that's a first   Must be a jolly good fellow Football and education don't gel well together > Barca under Barto bent over for most of the players.  I dont even think those players were bending him, he was giving sergi roberto of all people 190K a WEEK. Makes sense Which shows you know nothing of the alternative deal offered by the league which was way worse. This is a stop gap until camp nou is renovated. They can literally buyback the rights but nuance is lost on you. If you don't see the difference between a fan owned club and a privately own club I can't help you. > that's a first  And last? Anyways mate. I think we have everything squared off. And since this is reddit I am obligated to be a smarmy bastard sooo   Average Bar√ßa fan They will never buy back those rights. The idea that Barcelona is going to have a spare several hundred million Euros in their budget in the next few years to use buying back what they‚Äôve already sold is so laughable only a Barca fan would believe it.  If you only want to compare with other fan owned clubs feel free - you‚Äôll not find Bayern selling their future revenue to get out of bankruptcy any time soon. Hopefully not Lmao They easily could they were making 100 mil surplus from matchday revenue alone and projected another 120mil a season due to the new VIP section. It's laughable that you think you know everything about the situation though. Bayern aren't even completely fan owned and have 3 corporate owners that bank roll them. I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs just not possible to take you seriously when you think Barcelona are going to be making a ‚Ç¨120m profit a year from the VIP section of the stadium. What is the logic that makes you you think your club is going to make more than Real and Bayern do from their entire stadiums just on VIP tickets?  And why the wolves flair? It's not my numbers buddy. It's not possible to take you serious either since you want to skirt any part of my response you don't like. Have a nice day. No, the numbers are from the same board that‚Äôs been caught lying dozens of times‚Ä¶surely this time theyre telling the truth though!  By the way, you forgot to mention that even in Barcelonas own projections, from 2026 they‚Äôll be spending 90m a year just servicing the interest on. debt to build the new stadium‚Ä¶ Oh so you believe some numbers? That's rich. No, I don‚Äôt believe their numbers, but you‚Äôve misunderstood the bullshit numbers anyway."

I even remember a rumour about us monitoring Sudakovs development. I'd say Bayern should save the money and wait to get Wirtz in 2025. I imagine City will re-ignite their interest in Olmo after the Paqueta development. Please no, jeez. Oh hell yes Hmmm, attacking midfielder when Bayern have Musiala and want Wirtz in the future. I doubt this happens, especially for the price Does Leipzig become the new Bayern Feeder club?  Sabitzer, Upamecano, Laimer, ... Nagelsmann, Eberl, Freund...  I dont know. A new Football fan has every likelihood to think Olmo is another Manager. Bayern‚Äôs scoring honestly sucks ass and it has for ages. I like seeing it finally catch up to them. He really seem to be narrow sighted and panicky so far but I'll probably be proven wrong and it all works out in the end. Firing Brazzo was almost as stupid as firing nagelsmann If Kompany were to join and plays his 4-2-3-1, where would Olmo play? As a 10 or LW? I feel he will follow Alonso to Real in 2025. ü•≤ Please do Bayern will have a tough time signing Wirtz As good as Musiala is, his purely creative abilities are a bit lacking, he's better suited to taking his man one-on-one and dribbling through the opposition players,exploiting those small spaces rather than being the 10 who finds team-mates with his passes. Wirtz is exactly that profile of player but I'm not sure we'll get him. Freund came from Salzburg. Disagree, my main gripe with his time at bayern was how he attempted to rework the youth program and pushed away some of the most talented and most vital ppl there, just to get it done his way and it wasn't exactly successful.  The contracts he gave out and the bunch of ""random"" players he signed on over average wages make it seem, as if he wasn't financially very responsive.   He had afew bangers though. As a 10, with Musiala on LW especially cuz they have to pay 20% more then every foreign club in order to sign him... and it will be intresting to see if Carro keeps the ""don't sell to bayern mantra"" alive. wirtz wants to come in 2025 and we have the money, dont think its tougher than other transfers What about Tel, Gnabry and Zaragoza? He will be over 100 million. We also don‚Äôt actually know he wants to come. Gnabry is out of the equation. As much as I'd love to have him continue at Bayern, it's time since long to say goodbye to him. Too injury prone and too inconsistent. That contract renewal really hurts now.  Don't like the fact we're getting linked to Dani Olmo. No point in getting injury prone talents. Zaragoza would be 3rd choice LW if everyone's fit. Tel can play multiple positions along the forward line so he will most likely be used as a super sub tactically. Gnabry well.. we should cross that bridge when we get to it He was always very public on liking Bayern Munich and Barcelona(more so Messi)¬† And if they buy Felix he could be tempted by a chance to play with his idol https://www.tiktok.com/@danyalalves/video/7357317794276429089?lang=de-DE  Old info :D"

The rest are easy Sevilla is truly fucked if the best they can do these days is Sa√∫l.

Deportivo is so done Atletico and Real are weirdly wholesome. Who are the players leaving Spain? I can recognise Dovbyk, Morata and Fekir. Who else? why spiderman for atm? alvarez spiderman why? Who's spooderman Who is the red team at the back doing lines? Who is spoderman? A whole lot of these have that ""*My Precious...*"" face. Uche has been great so he's the highlight now, I guess Looks more like Rafa Mir for Valencia. This was obviously created before the sexual assault allegations, but still yikes. I think it's Danjuma, not Asprilla Valencia could be Mamardashvili since he's now a Liverpool player, but he remained at the club on loan for the season. The free agents still hanging in the market stand are a nice touch as well. I see Ramos, who else are there? Alaves got Toni Martinez from Porto and he scored in both games since he arrived. So does not seem so bad! Very happy for him. Who is represented by Spider-Man? AWB joined West Ham, not Atletico ... They had more exciting signings surely So far Alvarez seems to be excessive, Sorloth and LeNormand are just amazing, but I would trade my souls just to see proper left footed CB and to see Llorente being replaced in wingback role , to see him playing in middle instead¬† Definitely. Athletic also had a great window simply by keeping Nico and I think Villarreal + Real Sociedad had quite good windows aswell   Yeah losing Le Normand and Merino is rough but they managed to keep Zubimendi and signed promising players like Sucic and Oskarsson. If they had got Hummels over the line it would have been even better So far Alvarez seems to be more for future proofing Griezmann's departure/retirement. Villarreal had a great window imo It's Deportivo Alav√©s, but I don't really get why they are sad to be honest. Toni Martinez for 2M is an absolute bargain. Mouri√±o, Conechny and Stoichkov looks like decent signings to me aswell And Athletic! Aleix Garcia in the Leverkusen kit, leaving Girona like Dovbyk who he's walking together with. The one in the yellow kit might be Joselu (?), as he's gone to Al-Gharafa who have a yellow kit and it looks a bit like him. Next to Dovbyk in the red kit and beard could be Mamardashvili going to Liverpool? Not sure though, as he isn't in their GK kit. No idea about the last one, looks like an Ajax kit but I doubt that's Bertrand Traore lol. Could it be Merino in an Arsenal kit? Maybe.  Edit: On second thought, the bearded guy in the red kit is probably Nacho, who's left Real for Al Qadsiah. his nickname is ""La Ara√±a"" aka the spider. Atleti fans twitter spent the entire summer posting spiderman memes hoping to manifest the transfer Mallorca It can't be Mir because the mascot is smiling Muniain, although I think he plays for a new club now? Alvarez How is the guy who got messi his red card doing , I remember his face from time to time for some reason , villalibre if I am not wrong? Yeah I don't get it, Toni has been stellar for them so far, scoring in both games including a winner against Sociedad. They won both games where he played. Why is Mallorca doing lines? And why is it his nickname? For AWB it's understandable, but I don't really see a connection for Alvarez Maybe because they were connected with Hummels for a while but it was all just Fab Romano snorting too much coke? They are not doing lines, just searching in the scrapes for something good, like in a tombola where tickets are thrown to the ground if they don't have a prize. Some people may start looking at those tickets in the ground in the hopes that someone threw a prized one accidentally Spider-Man is kind of an evolution of his other nickname, Ara√±a (Spider) so called because he looked like he had extra legs when dribbling since he was so good he looks like tom holland Thank you for the explanation"

I fully expected them to tweet ""more good news"" Is that now enough for Olmo? Unpopular opinion but I actually think he will do well for us. I think his experience and work rate will fit it to our system really well. A lotta people also forget how good he was at Sevilla and those first 2 seasons with Barcelona where he was a nailed on starter for them. He‚Äôs not my first choice but I think he will come in and immediately fit in and do a job. A young left footed center back will come in next summer, and that sounds good to me. Could be pretty alright for Atletico. A team used to defending in a low block is much more suitable for him than a team in which he needs to defend a lot individually. we need him to leave man Convinced Barto signed him to fuck us over and to show us how good the academy is. There is no other reason to give him that contract. Watch him do a Luis Su√°rez and outclass the entire Barca squad in their H2Hs this season... Lenglet has always been a good player. He had a rough spell after an amazing spell with Barcelona..... I'm surprised he's still contracted to them. Gonna be a shit show next season when all these loaned out players will be back [deleted] Pichichi award for Lenglet. #ENJOYLENGLET Tbt to Villa doing this first He'll be fine for them imo. He's really not as bad as ppl pretend he is. He just can't play Barca's high line anymore. I hope he does at least again Real Madrid. Somehow Atleti shits the bed against us in league and I would prefer to keep that going! Unironically I wouldn't be surprised. He's actually a good defender but just got exposed in our high line.  With the extra protection afforded in Atletico's system, there's every chance he'll be better. I doubt it, Atleti always bends over for Bar√ßa. He probably won't even play, Bar√ßa usually adds in a fear clause in their loan deals Which transfer was that again lol it better be.. This plus Roque should be enough. They can register half of him because another half of him will be out of injured anyways I believe it is. If Betis and Atletico pay the full wages respectively it amounts up to the Olmo salary. It's not Unfortunately not, greenkeeper and cafeteria-workers will be loaned to Chelsea I saw over in the barca sub that this is not enough . They need to get rid of either fati or Garcia. Not sure how true it is. Apparently roque was not even registered already Iirc, he was good with Barca when he played regularly, but he would have the worst luck in almost every Barcelona game he played (i.e. own goals). Atletico depend a lot on 1v1 defending by their outside-CB‚Äôs though. Azpilicueta was the left sided defender against Girona and you clearly heard their coach and players talk about targeting him when he had to go up and press the attacker. he was a good player for 2-3 seasons in Barca. He declined significantly  since covid Barca fans were raving about him once he joined. Sometimes I‚Äôll never understand our fanbase and how easily we change opinions about someone or something. He was good for Barcelona, what are you talking about? They‚Äôll just loan them out again? I don‚Äôt get it, so many clubs have players on loan. So the same as this season? Hope we get the nike deal until then There was an offer, but Lenglet wants to stay in big leagues. They did, he wanted to stay in Europe. Lenglet rejected them Lenglet isn't even that shit. He had a very decent period on loan with Spurs, and although he was depth with Villa at first after Torres got injured he also did reasonably well for them. He will be fine with Atletico, especially since the defenders don't play with too much space in their back.  Besides, there were clubs interested in signing him, but Barca extended his contract till 2027. Lenglet said he wanted to stay in competitive football in Europe as long as he could and had no interest in going to Saudi. Barcaball was the stuff of nightmares. I hope they bring it back. Wasn't he ass for Villa last season? Atletico somehow beats Madrid but loses to Barca in the league while in the UCL it's always vice versa Not the case here. Roque wasn‚Äôt registered before, so it will not impact the Olmo situation. Hoping the Lenglet deal is enough. But that would be the case only when we're back to 1:1, right? good enough for a 12mil gross salary after two decent seasons tho? His signing was never the problem, his contract renewal with astronomical wages a week before Bartomeu resigned is what became a problem. Hes not shit hes just massively overpaid and therefore impossible to sell.   Barca didnt renew him to keep him just to lower his salary over the next few years so they have more flexibility   I lenglet was on 100k a week which would be fair for someone of his quality he wouldve been sold already. No he was pretty good but we won't miss him if that makes sense He was fine with occasional clangers. Not worth the wage packet and a significant drop off from Pau Torres. Maybe like a 5/10 overall Nope, he was a decent backup. He's not worth the wage he is on, but thats not his fault that Barca are stupid. He is a handy player. I really liked him. He wasn't amazing but as a rotation option for Pau Torres he was probably the closest match we could look for. He was really only brought in as emergency cover after Mings got injured so there was never going to be a long term place for him here but he did a good job when we needed him.   I can't say that I saw much of him during his Spurs loan but based on his performances for us, I'd say the reputation he's gained for being a bit shit is unfair. He's not a world class player but he's definitely good enough to be a rotation option at a top club. Isn't the problem that you can't register players if your wage bill is too high? So even if Roque wasn't registered, sending him on loan and getting rid of his wages will still help when it comes to being allowed to register new players with the benefit of hindsight of course not. However he was one of the best Barca players in prime age (24-25 at the time?) at the time of signing extension, and Barto wasn't exactly frugal individual.  I'm not saying it was a reasonable salary, I'm just saying everyone is acting as if he was always a deadwood, which is simply not true That's pretty much how he was for us as well. Fine in the air and good on tackles, but slow af and has the odd small mistake in him.   Good squad defender on way too high wages, that isn't great in a high line. I thank him for his service last year vs us üôè With him not being registered Roque's wages didn't count."

# [](https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/2aq42u9#icon-discuss-big)Points of Discussion

-   After a rocky start for Luis de la Fuente, the situation stabilised - and winning the Nations League gave Spain a solid platform to build on. The key question for this summer's tournament is whether they're capable of continuing along their chosen path of being slightly more quick and direct without giving up control in midfield, rather than looking stagnant and lacking imagination like they did in Qatar.
    
-   Injuries to Gavi (missing the tournament on account of an ACL tear) and Pedri (who may or may not be fit for the opening game after missing lots for club and country through muscle injuries) might mean Spain playing without two exceptional young midfielders. Can the slightly less young and less glamorous players pick up the slack?
    
-   How far can they go? A group with Italy, Croatia and Albania is not an easy one to navigate, even if four of the six third-placed finishers advance to the knockouts. Winning the group would set them up with a last-16 tie against such a third-placed team, while coming second means going up the second-placed team in group A - but the potential quarterfinal matchups could involve Germany or England, setting up finely poised tests against fellow favourites.

##About

**Nickname: Vatreni (The Blazers)**

**Association: Hrvatski Nogometni Savez (Croatian Football Federation)**

**Confederation: UEFA (Europe)**

**European Championship Appearances: 6 (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020)**

**Most Caps: Luka Modriƒá (175)**

**Top Scorer: Davor Suker (45)**

**Fifa Ranking: 10th**

**Elo Ranking: 12th (https://www.eloratings.net/**¬†**source)**

**History**

Croatia is participating in the European Championship for their 7^(th) time in history out of 8 possible opportunities, only missing out in 2000. Croatia has reached the Round of 16 twice (2016 & 2020) and quarterfinals twice (1996 & 2008) in its European Championship history.

**Path to Euro 2024**

The 2022 World Cup proved to be a successful tournament for us. A 3^(rd) place finish was reached which certainly surpassed general expectations leading up to the tournament. ¬†As always, Croatia had turbulent international breaks between tournaments.

Euro qualification started out decently. A disappointing home draw versus Wales was forgiven after a strong performance away to Turkey. The next round saw a comfortable home win vs Latvia and another win away to Armenia. At that point, qualification looked all but secure. The October break proved to be more challenging with losses to Turkey at home and Wales away. At that point, playoffs looked like a real possibility when it should have never gotten to this position. However, two wins in November away to Lativa and home to Armenia proved to be enough to secure direct qualification.

The 2023 Nations League Semifinals saw Croatia beating the Netherlands 4-2 in a dramatic extra-time victory only to narrowly lose to Spain in the final on penalties. Losing that final really felt like a gut punch as that very much felt like an opportunity for us to finally lift a trophy.

Croatia vs Albania Wednesday, June 19th, 2024, 15:00 Volksparkstadion, Hamburg

**Manager & Final Squad**

*Manager: Zlatko Daliƒá (CRO)*

**Goalkeepers (3):**

* Dominik Livakoviƒá (Fenerbah√ße)
* Ivica Ivu≈°iƒá (NK Osijek)
* Nediljko Labroviƒá (Rijeka)

* Borna Sosa (Ajax)
* Marin Pongraƒçiƒá (Lecce)

* Mateo Kovaƒçiƒá (Manchester City)
* Mario Pa≈°aliƒá (Atalanta)
* Lovro Majer (Wolfsburg)
* Luka Suƒçiƒá (Red Bull Salzburg)
* Nikola Vla≈°iƒá (Torino)
* Luka Ivanu≈°ec (Feyenoord)
* Marin Baturina (Dinamo Zagreb)

**Forwards (6):**

* Ivan Peri≈°iƒá (Hajduk Split)
* Andrej Kramariƒá (Hoffenheim)
* Bruno Petkoviƒá (GNK Dinamo Zagreb)
* Ante Budimir (Osasuna)

* Kristijan Jakiƒá (Augsburg)
* Petar Suƒçiƒá (Dinamo Zagreb)
* Niko Kristian Sigur (Hajduk Split)
* Igor Matanoviƒá (Karlsruher SC)

**Potential Starting XI**

(4-2-3-1/4-3-3)

*Livakoviƒá*;¬†*Stani≈°iƒá*, ≈†utalo, Erliƒá¬†*Gvardiol;* Kovaƒçiƒá, Brozoviƒá, *Modriƒá*, *Peri≈°iƒá*, *Kramariƒá*; Petkoviƒá

In my opinion, the 6 italicized players are guaranteed to be starters for us. Players such as Majer (Wolfsburg), Borna Sosa (Ajax), or Juranoviƒá (Union Berlin) could also be potential starters. Majer could compete for one of the midfield three spots via Kovaƒçiƒá or Brozoviƒá, but I expect our experienced three midfielders to start versus Spain at least. Some Croatians have been calling for Majer to start in some capacity as an advanced central-midfielder or on the right side. Look out for Martin Baturina as well as I think his profile fits well in the team as an advanced playmaker.

Dominik Livakoviƒá (Fenerbah√ße) is our clear #1 goalkeeper.

Dalic previously hinted that Gvardiol may play left back which would open the door for a player like Martin Erliƒá (Sassuolo) to start at central defense. There is speculation that he may opt for the Deschamps/Guardiola idea of playing 1-2 central defenders at fullback. I personally would like Gvardiol to stay centrally as he is our best defender.

**Points of Discussion**

* **Where will our goals come from? Who will be our starting striker?**

¬†First, we have¬†**Bruno Petkoviƒá (Dinamo Zagreb)**. Petkoviƒá was the hero of the 2022 World Cup quarterfinals versus Brazil and Nations League semifinal but also one of the heartbreaks of the Nations League final. He is a large striker while also posing very strong technical and playmaking abilities. He can be very inconsistent, but when he is at his best, he is a very special player. He truly has a unique profile for a striker who is 1.93m tall.

¬†Despite having great qualities and potential, Petkoviƒá has had a bumpy career. Petkoviƒá had moved to Italy as a teenager and never really settled at any club until he joined Dinamo Zagreb in 2019. Petkoviƒá contributed well to our qualification for the Euro 2020, but only made the squad once for the 2022 World Cup qualification matches, emphasizing his inconsistency. His last two club seasons have been decent. In 22/23, he registered 14 goals and 10 assists in 43 appearances. In 23/24, Petkoviƒá registered 18 goals and 9 assists in 43 appearances. As noted above, Petkoviƒá has had moments where he has majorly delivered for us. His performance versus the Netherlands in the Nations League semifinals will always stay in my memory. But he has not been consistent enough to make himself the clear option.

Second, we have¬†**Ante Budimir (Osasuna)**. Budimir received his first call-up and senior team appearance in 2020 at the age of 29 after having a successful spell with Mallorca in La Liga. This season Budimir really took off. Budimir scored 17 goals and recorded 2 assists in 33 La Liga matches for Osasuna. He won their player of the year; this season was Budimir‚Äôs best goal tally in his career. Now at 32, this would be the tournament to make a name for himself and build on his most successful season to date. The issue/negative for Budimir is that he has 1 competitive goal for us in 740 minutes total. A good percentage of those minutes came from substitute appearances, but the record is still not great. Budimir‚Äôs profile is more of a traditional striker.

Lastly, we have **Andrej Kramariƒá (Hoffenheim)** who could be an option. Personally, I do not expect Kramariƒá to lead the line, but it could happen. Out of the three options, Kramariƒá is the one with the most successful club career. For Hoffenheim, he has scored 132 goals and 56 assists in 284 appearances. Even this season, Kramariƒá scored 17 and assisted 6 in 31 matches, finishing the season strongly. He has had his ups and downs with the national team, but it feels like he has turned a corner a bit in the last two years. I expect Kramariƒá to start but not necessarily at striker. Kramariƒá is generally classified as a ‚Äúsecond striker.‚Äù He is a great goal scorer but also does a lot for you outside of scoring. He is quick, good on the ball, and altogether a versatile type of player. Therefore, I expect him to start at right midfielder/winger given that it is one of our ‚Äúweaker‚Äù positions.

*Who do you think should/will start at striker?*

* **Stick with the Original midfield 3 or try one of our younger, attacking midfielders?**

The midfield spine of our team (Modriƒá, Kovaƒçiƒá, and Brozoviƒá) has served us well for many years and multiple tournaments. On paper, it is one of the best midfields in international football. All three players have had very successful club careers, and each player brings a unique skillset to the midfield. With those three together, it makes it incredibly difficult for an opponent to control the match. However, those three together also limit our ability to score goals. This was demonstrated in the 2022 World Cup where we only scored more than one goal in a match versus Canada. Every other match, we sometimes struggled to create clear chances. This has opened debate among some Croatians to drop one of Kovaƒçiƒá or Brozoviƒá in favor of someone else.

**Lovro Majer (VFL Wolfsburg)**¬†is the player that is in mind for many. Majer, like many Croatian players, came from the famous Lokomotiva academy. He made his debut with the senior team in 2018 but he did not make an immediate impact. His career at Dinamo did not really take off until the 20/21 season where he registered 11 goals and 14 assists in all competitions. That successful season ultimately led to his transfer to Rennes in France. Things started off well with Majer; his first season was a success. Majer finished the 21/22 campaign with 11 goals and 13 assists in all competitions. Majer had been included in the 21/22 L'√âquipe team of the season. He was being linked to bigger clubs, such as Atletico Madrid, and it felt like he finally found that consistency required to reach the top level. Sadly, his 22/23 campaign was not as successful and during the summer of 2023, he transferred to Wolfsburg. The move to Wolfsburg, paired with manager Niko Kovac, gave us hope that he would kick on again, but Majer and Wolfsburg as a whole did not have a great season. However, in recent games for the national team, Majer has performed. In his last five matches, he has registered 4 goals and 2 assists which has caused some to call for him to start with the recent tournament goal-scoring struggles.

Majer is an interesting player. He is left-footed, very technically gifted, and a good passer. He can play as an attacking midfielder or even a right midfielder/winger. The issue with Majer compared to Modriƒá, Kovaƒçiƒá, and Brozoviƒá is that he does not offer much defensively and can sometimes drift out of games, emphasizing that inconsistency. Personally, I do not mind the Majer experiment if we are chasing a lead but certainly not to start versus Spain.

**Martin Baturina (Dinamo Zagreb)**¬†is a bit of a wildcard call for me. He is an attacking midfielder who plays for Dinamo and in my opinion, is the player profile that suits us the best if we were to opt to change the midfield three. He is a very good playmaker, technically gifted, while also having a good work rate. He is beginning to take the step up to the top senior level, and I would not rule him out making an appearance at some point. I do not think he will be a key player but he could feature and think he will impress.

**Luka Suƒçiƒá (Red Bull Salzburg)** is also someone who could feature. Suƒçiƒá had a lot of promise when he joined Salzburg in the summer of 2020. Suƒçiƒá's development has not quite gone as planned due to some injury struggles but the quality is still there. Suƒçiƒá has good, technical quality on the ball and is able to read the game well. His recent performance versus Portugal proved that he has the ability to play at a quick pace against strong opposition. He is a flexible midfielder as well, capable of playing in front of the backline and further forward.

*Should someone like Lovro Majer or Martin Baturina start in place of one of the experienced three midfielders?*

* **What are the expectations for this World Cup? What should be the expectations of this World Cup? Last run of this generation?**

The 2022 World Cup removed any doubt that 2018 was a fluke tournament. 2022 proved that Croatia can grind out results, has great team chemistry, and possesses a belief to win matches despite difficult circumstances.

Realistically, our group is the group of death. If you do not agree, I do not understand; Group B is a nightmare. Spain typically matches well versus us, and we play them first which is not ideal. Italy is very strong despite missing qualifications to World Cup, and Albania has improved a lot in recent years. However, if we manage to squeeze into the Top 2 of our group, we have a reasonable path to the quarterfinal then. We have a strong team, and in some ways, it feels like a ‚Äúlast chance‚Äù with this core/generation of players. Most of the spine still from 2018 could be playing their last tournament this summer in Germany. The squad could look very different in two years, so it is imperative we have a good tournament. So on that note, Ajmo Vatreni!

*What are your expectations/predictions for Croatia heading into the tournament?*

#Players to Watch

**Andrea Cambiaso:**
Coming off a breakthrough season at Juventus, Cambiaso's ability to play through balls with either foot and underlapping runs could be devastating in the tactically regressive world of international football

**Alessandro Bastoni:**
Simply the most potent offensive threat possessed by any centreback in Europe, playing in his favoured back 3 with his teammate Dimarco, if he can put crosses in-towards Scammaca with the quality he shows at club level, it could put Italy into contention.

**Federico Dimarco:**
One of Europe's best wingbacks, Gosens proved the viability of the position on the international stage last time out, could Dimarco do one better and cement it as the new zeitgeist?

**Federico Chiesa:**
3 years of injuries and inconsistency, yet Italy's best player on his day. If anyone can win a game on their own, it's him.

**Gianluca Scamacca:**
A 1.95 m (6'5) technically gifted striker in the form of his life, what more could you want?

#Points of Discussion
To say Italy has had mixed fortunes of late would be an understatement, yet being completely overlooked as a potential winners has suited them perfectly in the past. With Spalletti reaching immortality in Naples, could he do the same with his country? The Champions Of Europe are bloodied after the second consecutive world cup fiasco, but with a team that look quietly excellent on paper; if you come at the king, you best not miss.

-   Mario Mitaj, the rapidly developing leftback of Lokomotiv Moscow who can also play in defensive midfield, is on the radar of some clubs in Europe's bigger leagues, and good performances might well earn him a move. 
    
-   Kristjan Asllani, the playmaker deep in midfield setting the tone and the pace for his side.
    
-   Rey Manaj, the Sivasspor striker, who gets booked nearly as often as he scores goals - which isn't a necessarily a bad thing, given he scored 18 of them in the league this season.

-   Sylvinho, their manager: A much bigger name as a player for Arsenal and Barcelona than in his short and rather rocky managerial career so far, but capable of uniting and instilling passion into a side that will desperately need it if they are to gain points against three superior teams. Not shying away from controversial decisions, his squad selection and subsequent explanations haven't exactly endeared him to everyone.
    
-   Defending: In a group with Spain, Italy and Croatia, the expectations can't be particularly high, and yet a defensively solid, well-drilled and passionate side might well prove a stumbling block - keeping clean sheets as long as possible into the game will be key. 
    
-   Attacking: Counterattacking relying on the speed and technical capabilities, especially on the wing, is the name of the game here. And if the team holds down the fort well enough against the ball, we might well see a surprise result based on luring the opponent in before hitting them on the break and, ideally, scoring a goal against the run of play.

NB: /u/sga1 is also not Albanian, and has again cobbled this together based on half-arsed internet research on short notice.","45","deception42","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1dfth3t/euro_2024_group_b_preview/","Thanks to /u/sga1, /u/Punished__Allegri and /u/hrvat1818 for their assistance! I hope to have Group C up by tomorrow It seems like Spalletti will try Calafiori + Bastoni. Fagioli is injured so Cristante is probably starting unless Barella is good to go from the first minute. In general Italian medias are throwing out 15 different formations right now. We have never had such a deep talented squad of players that have different qualities and strength like for this Euro.   Despite our lack of quality strikers, this current Croatian team will be more offensively threatening than in the last world cup. The biggest reason is Gvardiol playing as a left back as he proved against Portugal that he can  also be great offensively. Furthermore, we also Suƒçiƒá and Baturina who are more offensively oriented than Modriƒá and Kovaƒçiƒá as bench options.   I also believe that our go to midfield trio is still elite despite not being the youngest anymore. Brozoviƒá remains a question mark though. Than there are also our defensive players who are bar Vida all good on the  ball as well. In combination with the midfield we should be able hold the ball against the strongest opponents and also be effective against high pressing teams.   Ultimately, I believe that we have the quality not only top the group but also have another deep run in the tournament. Hopefully this year will be our year and we will finally see our nation team lifting a trophy. Bold and wishful prediction: Albania will beat Italy with a banger from Asani, from around 25-30 meters.    Also, Nedim Bajrami, Broja, Asani and Asllani are definitely players to watch. It's sad that Kumbulla never really came back from that ACL injury. What an absolutely brutal group this is for Albania - and yet one of the other three dropping a game against them seems unlikely but far from impossible to me. Should that happen trying to get out of the group will be absolute carnage for all four of them. I think Pedri will be fit and is in good form. He will be one to watcg  Also to add, Rodri in NT isnt the Rodri we see in City Manaj for sure aint ones to watch i would change hom with broja lamine and nico wingers. Expecting all spain games to be electric I still want to believe that the journalists were wrong and we will play with the 3-man defense... [deleted]  >Bold and wishful prediction: Albania will beat Italy with a banger from Asani, from around 25-30 meters.    Ah, the [Ray Houghton](https://youtu.be/vGQplbF_akc) special I don't watch Spain very often. In what way is Rodri not the same? I was under the impression that he played well. He become a lot stronger. I just hope he doesn't get injured again like last times he got in good form. Very few players will perform the same way the do at City because of the system Pep implements and the actual squad they have to play with, I think Rodri does very well for the NT but maybe his offensive abilities are diminished  Also remember last tournament Luis Enrique put him in CB while Busqutets was still playing CDM Isn‚Äôt this Rodri first time actually playing dm? I remember last Euros he was CB, or was it even the World Cup I can‚Äôt remember ≈†to si nervozan? U ƒçemu je problem s Bobanom? [deleted] [deleted] Boli me ona stvar za tvoje pitanje Nisam to vidio.
