I thought it was 62m including bonuses. Wait 62 + 8 ? Wasnt that 52+8 ? Hawkins is very reliable for French players but still. That feel very high. Good on Lille Can't believe he's 100 million and wages are 200 a week Congrats to United, at least that’s  one less club willing to entertain our board’s stupid insistence on selling De Ligt No matter which CB we signed we can't win apparently  Just gonna wait until he actually play for the club Tbh whatever the figure is what matters is how he performs. He can cost 80m and turns out he's the next Varane it will be a great buy, if he cost 30m and flops it would be a waste of money So many people use the € and £ interchangeably and pick whatever narrative that fits their agenda. Ok that's nice United are cooking something this summer man If Madrid had made this signing everyone would be raving about how Madrid is hoarding all the talent. But because it’s Manchester United, they over paid and he’s not even that good.   Madrid just spend a similar sum on a 17 year old that had ONE pass in a major tournament final. That same 17 year old also looks like 20 lbs too heavy yet that was a steal? 50m POUNDS bid was laughed here for Everton defender but 57m POUNDS bid is somehow mental for a generational talent. Not sure what to make out of it.  Kept Pounds in caps because people keep interchanging them with Euros. Will lindelof remain at United? How quickly we went from ""MU win, Madrid lose"" to just ""MU lose"". Well, let's hope the guy turns out to be the goat now... This transfer fee is going up 10m a day lol Could the difference in fee be what the player's manager makes of the deal? Wow united does turn grown men into whiny cunts I really think if United are gonna spend €70m on a player it should have been a holding dm, the midfield was Swiss cheese last season and that exacerbated the amount of work the defence were having to do. Definitely need a cb but de ligt for cheaper might have been the smarter option. 52M GBP is not a bad price for a prospect on the level of Yoro. United fans should be happy How much money is he being paid per week? Very good on Lille since Madrid wanted to pay 20m or sign him on a free next summer According to Julien Laurens even PSG was at max going to bid 45 m.  Yet here we have United going for 62+8  For a 18 Year old with 1 year left.  https://x.com/LaurensJulien/status/1813628453205483718 Is he really that good that his price is set at 62M or is this just the PL tax that Man U is paying for? Perez holding firm looking more and more sensible (it always was this is silly money) United shitting out way too much cash on one player that's not even guaranteed to be good enough to start.  But hey if it means Real Madrid loses out on a wunderkind to add to their collection I'm all for it.  Hope they don't ruin him though they probably will.

But hey if it means Real Madrid loses out on a wunderkind to add to their collection I'm all for it.  Hope they don't ruin him though they probably will. Lmao ytd it was €50m + €10m. Now it's €62m + 8m. When the kid makes his first mistake, it will be £70m price tag and £200k / week wages , running headlines and putting pressure on him.   United tax works more ways than one. And they tried to get Branthwaite for half that… Typical United transfer.   1 yr left on contract. 18 and unproven. Given big wages   €60m euros   Not sure what the fans are referring to when they say ineos are doing it different. Screams Martial 2.0.  Edit spelling and grammar Yenny Loro the GOAT! [deleted] I'm not convinced this is the coup everyone is saying it is tbh. Very talented player I'm sure but I just refuse to believe he's been sold on this project over Real's as the best next step for his career.   I think it's more likely he's been convinced by Lille and his agent to make this move now so they can get paid, probably because he still has time for the Real Madrid move towards the end of the contract.   It's a hell of a lot of money and on top of that we're slapping the number of one of the best CBs in our history on his back. Been burnt before. I hope he does well but as an indicator of how United are moving differently I'm more excited by the Zirkzee transfer because that is the type of deal we have just flat refused to do in the past. Thank god we didn't cave on this. No matter how good the kid is, it's insane to pay this much for an 18 yr old defender. €70m for an 18-year-old who's only played 60 top flight games and has 12 months left on his deal doesn't seem like United's negotiation team have improved very much.  Looks like a decent signing all the same, though. My phone had just buzzed, a notification from Twitter lighting up my screen. It was a tweet from Fabrizio Romano, the man himself. My heart skipped a beat as I read the words: ""Here we go! Leny Yoro to Manchester United, done deal. Contracts signed, medical passed, official announcement imminent.""  I barely had time to process it before my legs gave way. Down I went, right in the middle of Greggs, clutching my phone like it was the Holy Grail. The sausage roll I had been waiting for was forgotten, lost in the whirlwind of emotions flooding my mind.  The first thing I felt was disbelief. Could it really be true? The next sensation was an overwhelming wave of euphoria. Yoro, the defensive prodigy we'd all been dreaming of, was coming to United! Visions of him shutting down attackers, making game-saving tackles, and commanding the back line with authority flashed before my eyes.  People around me were staring, some concerned, others amused. The Greggs cashier leaned over the counter, ""Are you alright, mate?"" she asked, her voice tinged with genuine worry.  I could barely nod. ""United... signed... Yoro,"" I managed to stammer, holding up my phone for her to see. Her eyes widened in recognition, and a smile crept across her face. ""Oh, wow! Congrats, then!"" she said, understanding immediately the significance of the news.  By now, word had spread. Fellow United fans in the queue started buzzing with excitement. Strangers who had never exchanged more than a nod of acknowledgement were suddenly hugging and high-fiving each other. The whole place had turned into an impromptu celebration.  Someone in the back started singing ""Glory, Glory Man United,"" and it quickly caught on. Within moments, the entire Greggs was belting out the chorus, our voices mingling in a raucous, joyous harmony.  As I finally got to my feet, the cashier handed me my sausage roll with a wink. ""This one's on the house, mate. A little something to celebrate the new signing.""  Walking out of Greggs, still in a daze, I couldn't help but think about how football has this magical way of bringing people together. From strangers in a bakery to fans across the globe, for a moment, we were all united by the promise of something incredible.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up on my knees in Greggs, not because of the pastries, but because Manchester United had just signed Leny Yoro. What a time to be alive! 70m euros is a significant sum. If we add up all the money they have spent on players like Lisandro,Varane, Maguire, Lindelof and AWB, it will be quite steep. Another bright talent gone to Man U to be squandered :( Hope this signing works out because it would go down as one of the worst signings of this era if it doesn’t Another french talent lost. They are about to become the next FC Barcelona at this pace [deleted] Looking at yoro’s stats and yikes. Last season he won 54% of his ground duels and 63% of his aerial duels. Seems like a huge gamble for utd. United fans acting like he won’t be in Madrid by 22 yrs old United doing a typical United business Eish Papa Flo always comes out looking better the more information drops on this transfer. There was no way he was gonna pay 70M for a kid with a year left on his contract.   He is so young though, I do hope he will be successful So we have a United young French talent… sad for the boy to be a guaranteed flop already but the stars align Why he think hes going to start with the slabhead or Lisandro? United doing United things Tier ass that journo, guessing at it's best, yesterday he was putting emphasis on only 5 year deal, after ornstein and Romano he changed that thing to plus one, clout chaser. Perez: nice nice, looking forward to getting him on a free when he turns 23 18-year-old joining the most challenging league on one of the highest-profile clubs that also has _no one_ of value or consequence in the position to mentor him.   Oh, and this club's captain is a guy whose public image is defined prominently by his tantrums, theatrics, and shitty body language at the first sniff of difficulty.   If I had to wager, United's going to fuck this kid up unless he's got a stellar personal / behind-the-scenes support system. What a waste. There are talks of United offerings the player twice as much in sign-on bonus. Insane. I think its the currency Yoro price keep getting increased so that we can paired him with Lisandro who height keep on decreasing No idea, Fabrizio keeps saying €50m + €12m in add-ons too Welcome to a man utd transfer, the sum goes up by the article Pounds vs Euro's and whether they're reporting the sum including bonuses or without. €70m total package, but if you heard £52m fee both are technically correct. Ornstein said 62 m initial and 8 m add ons, Sometimes in dollars, sometimes in pounds, sometimes in euros. It’s because they deployed Rio and he said.. “blank cheque, sign the ting, united’s back baby! Yoro at the wheeeeeeeeeel balloon door balloon door! It’s a United thing… sadly whatever deal we do, it always gets reported as the highest possible sum, no matter how wildly off it is Ornstein also reported 62+8 but that wouldn’t make sense when De Ligt would have been 12m less and we didn’t want to pay that… Lmao they refused to pay for Branthwaite, who is proven in the prem, and then sign a very young player for roughly what Everton wanted. This could very easily be the first really bad price of the Ratcliffe era, even if the player turns out okay. It's 52 + 7 in pounds 70 mil for a teenage centerback with one year left on his contract has to be the best deal of this window, by far. For Lille of course.  Imho it would make more sense to by somebody like Calafiori, or even Bastoni for that money. Established players. Ornstein reported the same 62+8 in his last report. Romano is the one still reporting the 50+bonuses.   Nevertheless, 70m for him is fucking mental. Lille have somehow managed to get the maximum value on an 18 year old with one year of senior football under him.   Chelsea and City did it in the 00’s when they wanted a player but United definitely contribute to the overpaying for players and ruining the transfer market.   We acquired Smalling and Jones when they were just a bit older than this guy. Let’s hope he’s even more successful than they were. Pounds vs euros Can’t believe he’s 200 million and wages are 400 a week. I wouldn't hold your breath, I can see them selling and then coming back for him. I definitely see us coming for de Ligt as well. What’s wrong with De Ligt ? What is bayern fans current view on DeLigt. Is he a confirm starter? Honestly, his only downfall would be lack of confidence. He showed in Ligue 1 to be an extremely promising CB. ManU fans should be excited. I think after Varane came in your image of CBs have been ruined. I mean dude you cannot make such big moves for Maguire, Varane, Lindelof, Martinez (net value here is €220m fyi) and have most of them fail to light the world on fire and not expect the world to see it as a negative.   Kinda unlucky on one hand, but it has to be a coaching issue because legit I keep thinking these signings will make the difference when they don’t.   Arsenal fan here too, this is sorta like a rich version of us after we signed Mustafi, Holding, Sokratis, Luiz, and Pablo Mari - then went on to get Saliba and Gabriel. It’s like you gotta get rid of that “stink” first lol. Cheers Geoff. Check out the big brain on Brett And thanks for being honest I for one cannot believe Man Utd (the most foolish club in the world) spent 10.6b yen on him as reported by some Journos.  However if the other Journalist reporting the greatest footballing geniuses swindling Lille for only 24.5m Kuwaiti Dinar are to be believed then we got a real bargain on our hands. I thought he was from Lile not Nice Do we know the reason why he chose United over Real? Debt? [ > United are cooking something this summer man](https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-12-at-3.26.19-PM.jpg) With their spending, they better be cooking the books. With their spending, they better be cooking the books. > If Madrid had made this signing everyone would be raving about how Madrid is hoarding all the talent. But because it’s Manchester United, they over paid and he’s not even that good.  They DID overpay as it stands right now, in order to secure him. Real Madrid reportedly never offered more than €40 mill. and United ended up paying almost €70 mill. That's wild for an 18 year old with 1 year left of his contract - and good business done by Lille.   Literally no one has said that he's not even that good, he's a great talent with huge potential.   > Madrid just spend a similar sum on a 17 year old that had ONE pass in a major tournament final. That same 17 year old also looks like 20 lbs too heavy yet that was a steal?  Did you just judge Endrick based on one national tournament? Are you gonna count Mbappe out too based on his poor EM? Come on.  Those ""20 lbs"" too heavy set is muscle, you can literally google him and see.  Do better. That never happens.   We were criticised for both Vini and Rodrigo. The reason Endrick wasn’t criticised as much is because the former two evolved into fantastic players who have already won everything.   Madrid isn’t ”hoarding” talent and Flo is above all an amazing businessman who knows when business is good or bad. If we wanted Yoro we’d have gotten him. The term generational talent is nowadays used way too often. Alot of rival clubs fans are denominationally challenged Yeah lmao we offered a similar amount for Branthwaite who has only had 1 season in the PL and is older and everyone said it was lowballing Everton You're looking at it wrong. It would be mad for Everton to have accepted that bid because of PL experience and quality + English tax. They can easily get close to £80m  You've paid absolute top price for this kid when he was gonna leave on a free otherwise. Be mad of Lille to turn this down. Ehh, there's like half a dozen ""generational talents"" every year. It doesn't mean anything anymore. 1 year left on his contract and about 1 and a half seasons total of minutes, bit mad yea. The fact Everton laughed at 50m for branthwaite shows why buying from other PL clubs is almost pointless really?  English, Prem club to prem club transfer, homegrown policy.  Gee I wonder why his price might be super inflated hmmmmmm No the £50m bid was laughed at (and actually it was the even lower bid that caused most of the laughter) because it was so far below Everton’s valuation which is the important factor when it comes to buying players English tax Probably not, he's been struggling with his back so much he hasn't been able to hack it the last few years. Think he needs a step down, honestly. Honestly that can be solved quite easily by playing a higher line. Problem is we didnt have the players to do so with Martinez out and Varane/Maguire. That meant our attackers were trying to initiate a press but our defence sat deep, leaving a huge gap between the midfield and back 4. Anytime the initial press was bypassed (often because it's uncoordinated) that gave the opposition a free run directly at Casemiro and our back 4. Hence why both looked so poor and we often got cut apart like a hot knife through butter. Playing a higher line would allow the back 4 to collapse that space but guys like Varane and Maguire do not have the legs to cover ground if the ball is played in behind. Excuse me sir, we offered a whopping 20 + 10 and might've gone up to 30 + 10 if ManU hadn't closed it so fast The one year left was working against United in a way as he would go to Madrid on a free most likely. This was their only chance to get him. If he’s even pretty good this is a great deal for an 18 year old. They had to make themselves more attractive than Real Madrid. You know they couldn't point to the coach or the locker room. If you watch him play regularly and tell us he's shite for 70m , I'd be more than ears.  18 year old , 1 year , good earner ~ that's football mate.  Felix ~ 120M Coutinho ~ 120+  Mahrez  < 70   And yet all are great players.  Although mahrez career >>>>>> both   So depends if you watch football or do you read football.  You're probably #2. You're getting downvoted because this sub is delusional but this is 100% right. €70m + huge wages for a teenager on the last year of his contract... and everyone here is calling it a great deal lmao.  Yeah it's a great deal indeed... for Lille. If they weren’t all babbling about “moving different” it wouldn’t be as bad. But 60 mil plus for a 18 yr old on huge wages with a year left is still crazy You're getting down voted but I agree. I like to think I'm pretty clued in to highly touted prospects but I've never heard of this kid. That obviously doesn't mean he's a bad player but United are notorious for being bad at transfers. You might actually be stupid. What reason would Real have to ‘bait’ United into anything? It’s not like they don’t get all your scraps anyway. Unless he has a flawless season his price will always be the talking point. I don't see him having a season like that with his level of overall experience.    They overpaid imo. If he does move to Real in a couple of years, it means that we got some very good years out of him and I'm entirely ok with that though.   I think 15 is coz he wore that number at Lille. His agent actually pushed him to RM. It was Lille who pushed for a bigger transfer free  I knew this before summer even started and even told RM fans. There was no way he’d leave for free next summer and there was no way RM would get him for 30-40m when there are clubs offering much more. They didn’t force him to choose United but Leny would never stick it to Lille.   United pushed hard enough and got him and they got an amazing defender He would have been a rotation player with slow integration for us. A project like Camavinga. That shows in our valuation.   United, by paying this fee, is putting crazy expectations on the kid. God help him if he has a rough start, especially if they don't sign any other CB. Its a really interesting study in group-think. Paying big fees on inexperienced players is literally the sort of shit United have done for years and the fans have never stopped moaning about how dumb it is (Antony, Hojlund, Sancho, AWB, Fred, Martial). Time and time again United have paid big fees and big wages for young players and it hasn't worked out.    But now there's new owners apparently overpaying for young inexperienced players is a good strategy. That’s the thing for Yoro. Unless he ends up being considered the best in the world, its doubtful that Madrid will pay more than what United paid for him since he is a defender, and if is he good, United will want more than Madrid may be willing to pay. His option then would be to leave on a free but there is a high chance Madrid will have good to World Class players and have no need for him by that time.   Never say never but the old saying that Madrid only calls once is also generally true (unless you’re Mbappe). I don’t think we will ever see him in the Bernabeu outside of a European night. How much did your club pay for Endrick? To be fair, Saliba was around 30m euros and he had only 16 appearances at that time. We had 0-1% chance of landing him a few weeks ago. I don’t think there was much room for negotiating. If we wanted him then we had to make sure it was too high for Real to compete. If we went in at 40 and Real bidded 30 for instance, he wouldn’t be here. The offer had to be too good to turn down. The 12 months is irrelevant. It's not like United could have gotten him on a free when Madrid were literally waiting to snap him up when possible.   Same for a lower fee. PSG were said to be bidding 45m, who knows how much that would amount to with all bonuses included. 60 top flight games for an 18-year-old is pretty good though? Yoro is a phenomenal talent as per most of the French football experts and is surely gonna start for us. Not a big price to pay if he's gonna be a key part of our defence for many seasons. 60+ 55+40+80+30+55 = roughly £330m ish , but we do have a FA/league cup to show for it though, haha... :( Why would you use that collection of players? Weeks later he buys the top defensive talent in the world. Man that sucks If he's that good, they'll have sold him for 100+. I don't think they'll be too displeased about it You're assuming United won't ruin him. If he goes on a profit after playing well for 5 years, I don't see the problem tbh Perez is retiring.  Change will happen.  Barca used to be god but change of management humbled them. [deleted] Next update will be “Utd sign Yoro for 62,455,420,132 Argentine Pesos” Idk it was reported as 50 plus 12 in euros before. To be fair Martinez has performed impressively well for a 3'4"" CB. I read reports saying €50m +€12m. 62€ total. [deleted] Salary differences I guess. And considering resale value? Because the total cost for De Ligt would be significantly more? Wages It would make sense. One is 6 years younger They don't rate De Ligt that high.   And frankly neither do I. Like he's clearly talented, but hopping from Ajax to Juve from Bayern to United within 5 years suggests there's a problem somewhere. And his injury record isn't the greatest.   He really can't be a 60m player if he's not starting above De Vrij and Dier in his peak years. Branthwaite would be £20 to £30m more expensive. 1 good season = ""Proven in the prem""  If he's so good why aren't other clubs in it for the same price that Everton wanted? Are they stupid? pound getting stronger so it looks like less > Bastoni   Does Bastoni even want to leave Inter? Calafiori has only played like 20 more games than him, and I don’t think he’s better than Yoro. Bastoni would be nice, but he’d never leave Inter for us. I don’t see where else we could have spent this money for a similar profile including age. Can’t believe they actually paid 7 billion for an infant mate I think it's hard to argue it's anything other than high risk. The lad has had a very good first season but he's also a teenager and likely hasn't even finished developing physically.   If they're expecting him to step in from the off it's going to be tough. And very likely that within a couple of years he will want a move to Real Madrid.   But in that case he is playing so well so it is what it is i guess. Why would Bastoni ever leave Inter to Man Utd? man doesn't know ball Well it's not 70M for him is it? Somehow United always gets bashed for full price + bonuses lumped into 1 price when they buy players. It's more than double what anyone has ever paid for a CB aged 18 or under. Which includes Saliba and Bastoni. How much was Endrick? I mean, it isn't 70m. Talking like Chelsea didn't pay 116 and 120 on 2 young mids in the last 2 years Only Phil Jones was hyped like Yoro was, and the hype wasn't even wrong, he was just made of glass Because Real were supposedly interested too, so money talks. Why on earth would United spend 364 million on an 18 year old prospect? It makes zero sense considering he'll be on 875M a week Hopefully by then they would’ve regained their senses Damn why can’t you guys just let me hope lol Nothing, the club just decided they don’t want him and have put him up for sale despite him being our best defender with the highest ceiling. Only? He won 60% of his aerial duels last season. He’s not ready for the premier league. This is a huge gamble. Varane is proper quality. He was just injured half the time but when he played he was class Huh? Martinez is class and had two freak injuries last year but still a top 5-7 CB in the league. Maguire just had a renaissance after 2 awful and hard years but even before that he was rock solid as our CB1 and captain. Lindelof plays his role as CB4 extraordinarily well and is solid against most teams. Varane just couldn’t stay healthy but when he was, he was tremendous on the field. Instrumental part of two cups in two years for us. Sure 220M is a ton, but good players get more and more expensive but don’t act like the guys you’ve pointed out are abject failures. His club gets money. He gets to play way more games. And if he proves himself he gets to go to Madrid in a few years on a bigger salary. That's already been on the table for years pal Haha debt? Do you know how much in interest alone we paid for glazers debt?  United will clear that debt if the new owners actually invest into the club instead of taking money out of it like the Glazers did. There's very few clubs that make the kind of money that Man United makes Well it's not like United is poor. Also they've already cleared some wages, sold Kambwala, Greenwood will be sold.  If they get rid of AWB, Lindelöf, Casemiro, Sancho and maybe McTominay. They'll have plenty of money to sign 2-3 new players. We have a running total of like 1.1 billion in debt or something close to that, and that number has been bad for a long time. Like Barcalona, we just print money I guess. We've been swimming in debt for 2 decades mate this is our natural habitat now 😭😭 The movie was excellent Ffs sake man 😭😭 I think they’re expecting some major sales , maybe Casemiro to Saudi and some fringe guys like lindelof and awb   Also with ffp it’s not based off one single year remember I think they’re expecting some major sales , maybe Casemiro to Saudi and some fringe guys like lindelof and awb Where are you getting this €70 million figure from? Most reports say it’s up to €63 and even then there are some sources saying it’s lower than that. If Yoro comes out to be at least PL quality and he serves United for the next five or six years then he’d be worth every penny, if he’s world class then he was a bargain.   I’m judging Endrick based on multiple games I’ve watched of him. He got bullied by the Uruguay defenders despite his “muscular” build. Im not that impressed by what he’s shown playing in Brazil either. Half the time he’s playing against 35+ year old defenders. I don’t see how that makes it any better than what United is spending on Yoro.   Mbappe is a World Cup winning, elite talent that has demonstrated his ability on the biggest stages since he was 17. No one even mentioned him in this thread. Do better. Madrid definitely wanted Yoro, saying they didn’t now is revisionist. Madrid was banking on their badge doing all the heavy lifting for them in negotiations with Yoro pretty much trying to lowball Lille into giving up their biggest talent for peanuts. And as far as we know it was working until United came into the picture. Care to explain why Leny Yoro doesn’t fit the description? Really? Who else is described as one? I think it's funny how they said Yoro isn't even an international, so why would we spend that much on him, as if Branthwaite is an international or something. Does him leaving on a free matter to any club who isn't Real Madrid? Be mad of Lille to turn him down because if was gonna leave for free or pennies to the best club at collection talent in the world otherwise. Makes no sense whatsoever. Yoro is considered way bigger talent. Also him being in his last year of contract makes no difference. Only team that can get him for free is Real Madrid. United bid was to ensure Real won’t match it, and still only is 7m pound expensive than what they bid for Everton “1 year PL experience” player  Good luck to Everton if they think they can 80m for him. Maybe they can ask Real Madrid to pay that he was going to leave on a free but go to RM. This was the only way United could get him. 'Easily' ok Oh it was. Pull that post where it is mentioned United bid 45+5. Every single post was mocking that bid That is fine. But i wasn’t talking about Everton refusing it. I was talking about how people here mocked it. And now they have “concerns” over a fee that is just 7m more for a player of much higher ceiling Apologies, didn't know Perez had loose change > If he’s even pretty good this is a great deal for an 18 year old.  Yeah I mean we'd be set for the next decade with him as a starter and our central defence with him and Martinez is pretty young, that money is for the present as well as the future compared to other big signings we've made which we've bought for their current ability even as they reach their twilight years with diminishing returns. Nothing about this comment makes any sense. What a comment this is, hahaha. You’re a pro scout or what? Yeah, I think it's weird that so many United fans are finding ways to be worried about this transfer. Not every player is going to kiss the badge on their way to the club. Looks like the new United team have conviced him in some way or another and they are convinced this is what's best for United. That's all I need to be excited about this signing and I can't wait to see his progress in a United shirt. There’s a weird thing where every transfer saga has to have a “winner”, loads of weirdos on twitter (and on here) going “lol he rejected Madrid for United!” And vice versa when the opposite happens.   Sign for United now or run down your contract and sign for Madrid in a season sounds like an obvious choice but that’s a season of uncertainty for a young player.   If he has a bad injury or falls out of favour with Lille (which is likely as he’s denied them a transfer fee by refusing a move) then his career could take a hit. There’s a reason very few players (especially 18 year olds) run down their contracts to leave on a free despite the obvious upsides We play Liverpool three games in and that will almost certainly set the tone for him.   But my issue is less with him as a player and more about whether this is the bit of genius business it's been heralded as. We've essentially thrown the kitchen sink at him and that hasn't gone well for us in the past. Word is we still want deligt but only if we can sell Lindelof. And Mou is interested. Clubs are also looking at AWB. Disagree. Mainoo, garnacho - all been pretty carefully handled until they proved themselves - we have faith in our youth, however we do seem to be moving towards a much more sensible blended, rotation based squad setup (i hope) Nail on the head. Hope* he’s a mentality monster. Whilst I agree to an extent, there is one big difference between the signings under Glazer and now the new management.   Realistically we were the only club interested in signing those players, we weren't competing with top clubs for the signing of Antony, Hojlund, Sancho etc. Whereas with Yoro there was genuine interest from PSG, Liverpool and Madrid.   The frustration shared by a lot of the fans was, why are we offering this level of money? It normally boiled down to incompetence, if we really wanted Antony we could have signed him earlier in the window for a lot less. Whereas with Yoro, we've identified a talent and signed him much earlier in the window and hopefully have a plan in place.   Of course only time will tell. Wages are always more important then initial fee. High wages = no market for the resale = stuck with them and hands tied by FFP etc. If we sign 3 x £60m young players a season. 1 makes it 2 are mid. Mid players are sold on for £30m, and have a good pool of buyers - the key is that wages need to be sensible for all signings to make this strategy viable. They did the same for Smalling and Jones. Both went on to be relative successes, who had their ceilings capped by consistent injuries in their 20’s.    Your point stands, that it is a risk. Sancho wasn't inexperienced      Fred wasn't. His feelings was realistic for his price.     Martial was literally 35mil base price. With appearance, major trophy and BdO clauses.     AWB at 45+5 wasn't terrible either.     Antony and Hojlund have been 2 punts. 1 is a flop. The second is not terrible for the price.  We don't need to profit from him. We need him to become a leading PL defender. If we eventually sell him for 30-50m, fine. Far better than our past deals, £80m defenders who will end up leaving on a free, after being handed huge contracts. I'd rather we spend £40-70m on young talent, sensible wages. When they come to renew, we either sell them, or if they become world class, then we extend them on market rate wages for elite players Endrick was €35M+€30M in add-ons for an attacker with more than one year left on his contract and signed before 18 years old. It’s not really comparable as attackers will always be more expensive than defenders. I guarantee that if Endrick was a defender, the club would not have spent anywhere near that amount, if at all, since I’m not sure clubs would be paying that much attention to Endrick if he was a defender. Not a defender. Attackers come with a premium attached. At the same time we slow cooked Saliba on loan for two extra seasons so he got the experience and wasn’t just an 18 yo being thrown into the fire.   A lot of expectations and pressure will be put on Yoro especially if he’s being brought in to make an instant impact. We never made an offer apart from 35+5 and the max we were going to go for was 40+5 I appreciate the effort. Got a chuckle out of me :) Then the next day the update will be “Utd sign Yoro for 65,578,485,287 Argentine Pesos” Young black French player, they should definitely report the fee for him in Argentine Pesos just to troll Shortest CB to ever win the FA Cup! > 62€ total  bargain I’d be surprised that we value Yoro worth more than €12m more than De Ligt, unless it’s because of the wage demands… De Ligts not exactly 30 though.  I think salary demands must be what it is which would be a positive sign; we need to stop signing players on over £200k unless it’s Mbappe or Haaland level players… Yeah I was thinking wages must be the factor.  People seem really upset that I questioned the logic of the decision. If one was 28 and they were at the same level that would make sense.  But you’d still expect 8-10 good years from De Ligt and less likely to leave in 4 for Madrid as well… I swear. If he is as good as a prospect as they say than why arent madrid even looking in the direction of him? I mean, you could also ask why other clubs aren't interested in Yoro at €62m +€8m. if we sign a player capable of moving to madrid in their prime i’d be happy, we’d make money back anywaysb Money > Somehow United always gets bashed for full price + bonuses  Mudryk says hello.   Happens with every player. Especially young expensive ones. It is the same for everybody. Nobody says we bought Endrick for the 35 fixed either. They even add taxes to it to make it 70.   Regardless, only 8m of it is bonuses, that is not a big part.. The same way nunez got bashed with the full fee mate it happens to everyone Is that not kind of on you guys for paying it?   No disrespect, but Sancho aside, it feels like Man Utd consistently end up going for the price asked and paying the 'what they could be worth price'. It's not a United thing. Happens to most clubs. My guess is because bigger numbers sell more stories, so it's only natural. Wait until they include the salary too. The bigger the number the better reaction they get Wait until they include the salary too. The bigger the number the better reaction they get Mate Haaland became the first ever player who’s transfer included wages, agent fees, sign on bonus AND shadow payments. The full fee is 70 mil the money transfer is 62. Our second offer for him this week was supposed to be 30+10.  Tbf he does have way more games under his belt Good thing he isn't u18 then isn't it? Sure, but Saliba was bought for a pretty decent fee and was loaned out. I remember Arsenal fans believing he was going to leave. Roughly the same overall, 60 max with bonus included and then 12 millions in taxes And they’ve been doing it for a lot longer than that. It started in the Abramovich era. I won’t compare levels of hype but the ceiling for a young Smalling was also very, very high.   He developed into a good player and only injuries and a complete lack of confidence from the Moyes-Jose era of his career stalled his progression.   I liked Smalling but remember watching one game in his last season where he refused to make 5 yard passes his weaker foot and knew that he was mentally done. This is a joke. Never did i think Sir Jim would spunk £728m on an 18 yo unproven CB. What's far worse is the £1.6bn, 8 year contract! Insane that United are splashing 500m on a kid with 1 year left on his contract, especially considering that he'd be on astronomical wages of around 950k a week shut up ffs, this joke is just pathetic by now Are Bayern going to sign Tah regardless of De Ligt staying or leaving? Because we need it more badly... :( Same stats as Saliba. Although I'd say that Yoro is only 18 so he can improve and get bigger as he adjusts to the Premier League. Not intended as an ad hominem attack on anyone. I don’t watch United, can’t tell you anything specific about the players other than what I can find online lol so 100% biased and not accurate most likely.   However, I think my point about their “stink” does make sense still. Even the most quality player can do this, see Ozil or Auba at the end of their runs at Arsenal. Exactly. We’re not talking about Antony or Sancho situations where we spent a ton for players who greatly underperformed or just didn’t even bother to show up. Our CBs, including Evans, have done a surprisingly good job despite injuries and constant pairing changes. It might be the one area where we had the most consistent performances. Forwards underperformed, midfield had some highs and a lot of very very lows, and we could always count on the wingbacks to make a few braindead plays each game and would often lose their man. Man I wrote a whole essay to describe that my intention wasn’t to attack anyone in specific but it literally didn’t save lol.   But yeah, no I have no real issue saying where they are good. Just that they were not good from an actual outsider perspective.   As an Arsenal fan, I can defend Holding, by saying he won us an FA Cup (with Mertesacker). Or Sokratis, by saying “He wasn’t that bad, just had bad partners.” Or even Luiz, by saying “Just wasn’t consistent, but if he didn’t have a huge error every once in a while, he’d be useful.”  My point is, regardless if it is his fault or not from injury, even someone like Varane (who was undisputedly and statistically one of the better CBs in the world at the time) couldn’t “save” United’s defense - why would 18-yo wonderkid with 46 games played do it? (With full respect to both players)  I mean, now it’s like he has to, imo, or this image will never go away lol. Saliba went for 30m, if he failed, we would never hear the end of that. The only reason you can’t really bring up Mustafi €35m is because we have the best defense in the league with Gabriel and Saliba costing less than Leny Yoro between them. Good luck to him though, really. Yes they will clear the debt if they decide to pay it off. Greenwood was announced earlier on. Quite low key though [deleted] My point is if Madrid really wanted Yoro at all costs, then he would be a Madrid player weeks ago. If Flo didn’t pay the money it’s because he didn’t think it was a good enough business move. Madrid isn’t a club that lowballs others and the club sure isn’t suffering financially.   What is weird is the fact that United is getting a talented CB and everyone is making it look like a Madrid loss instead. Because he’s 18 and no one has a clue whether he’s anything other than hype It should be the opposite way around shouldn't it? True generational talents are extremely rare - only a handful every generation, by definition. So the real question is - why does he fit that extremely lofty description? Because there are like 5-6 CB's as good, if not better, than him around the same age? Cab you tell why he is? A generational talent is the likes of Maldini, Ramos and Van Dijk. This guy is not even part of the national team yet You're so stupid it hurts Just pointing out why it makes sense for people to baulk at the Branthwaite bid despite Yoro seemingly being comparative as a CB option.   From the other clubs POV, Utd were initially miles off for Branthwaite, and then probably overpaid for Yoro when they had the bargaining chip of 'accept it or he leaves for fuck all' in their pocket.   Whether Utd care about that is irrelevant to that point. You reek of bitterness, considered by who? Who else went in for Yoro, Real offered 20 or so?   This is the problem with getting all your football knowledge from twitter. i wasn't trying to be serious, but if you really want to, there're so much more context you left out to justify this transfer, it's just so biased at this point. Deleted He’s not gonna stay there for a decade Let me dumb it down  Even 100+ million doesn't guarantee success.  But getting a great player into your team is super exciting.  Ineos way is diff because United usually goes after already proven folks for 60+ million so this 18 year old with world class ceiling is deffo exciting and different.  Re-read or chatgpt it if you still don't get it. I guess from managing in Football Manager It’s the same about us and Marquinhos in this case. He was 19 years old when he joined us and it was simply because we offered more than Barca.   I beg of anyone to ask him to leave now or asked him even 5 years ago. He’s getting paid wonderful wages, everyone loves him and is captain. He didn’t kiss the badge at first but he’s fluent in French and his kids know all PSG chants. He’s leaving only if the club kicks him out I mean the sameish logic can be used with the everyday person going to work. It’s easier to put in an extra ounce of effort or stay determined when you are working for your dream company/job.   Look at the Mbappe backlash from PSG. Even though Mbappe helped PSG to a champions league finals, and became their top scorer, a lot of fans do not care to recognize any of his accomplishments because “it always seemed like he had one foot out the door” and stuck around only for money. He probably did, but even if he didn’t, the way he left psg ruined his reputation at PSG  I’d rather have a player or a worker that cares for what they are doing and cares for the company (or club) than someone who is coming just to get a paycheck and then leave. We’re not exactly a fantastic springboard for talent these days in our defence. That’s our concern. You didn't sign those guys for 70m... You paid the price of a starter for him. Yoro absolutely has to hit the ground running for that price, otherwise your defense is shambles. United needs to fight for throphies, that has to be the expectation. There's stories of the Shakthar Chairman laughing at how much he got United to pay for Fred.   50m for AWB 5 years ago was clearly a huge over pay.   Martial has cost United a fortune and been mostly garbage   Who are you trying to convince with this biased nonsense? Fancy way of saying 65 million for a 17 year old kid. Ball playing defenders with carrying capabilities are at a premium right now, even more so when they’re young and have high potentials. Which is a sensible offer for this sort of player. This guy is getting downvoted but 70m is obviously too much. Smart of PSG to back out. ""the max we were going to go for was 40+5""   Look I just think the club's in the business of burning money when there are other positions to fill players in. Not with professionals in charge unlike previous years anyway.   If they felt they had to spend 60+10 to get him, honestly I trust them. Maybe the threat was from PSG and that isn't out publicly, maybe it's Liverpool, maybe it's to be sufficiently far away from any other offer from Real Madrid that Lille/Yoro don't just sit on it for the whole summer.  Wait till we report them in Ringgit! I dunno given their inflation it could be literally anything you're looking at 1,570,341,411,233.74 in Laotian kip It was so cool when he climbed inside it. I had a 70€ bid but cancelled it because I didn't think it would go through, fml Probably looking at 6mil per year (120k/week) vs 12mil per year (240k/week).  Yoro is the bigger transfer fee, De Ligt is the more expensive transfer. Optics of 'beating Madrid to a wonderkid' Vs a high wage player a club actively want rid of is a big consideration too. I for one am grateful that you guys overpaid a million players but if you can age out a lot of those contracts and establish a new baseline that would leave a lot more room for transfer fees. It’s crazy some of the players at united that were in the top 20 salaries in PL and higher than most of own our stars I think they said delight was going to be 250k a week at least and Yoro is getting 115! How much did 18(?) yo MDL move to juve for? You’re trying to use too much logic to describe the illogical workings of Man United transfer signings. True true They’re going to sign him on a free in five years Mudryk was obviously bought for 280 million based on the numbers constantly thrown around 😂 And Mudryk wasn’t even that young. Just expensive It's not the same for everybody lol, fuck me Haaland is still reported as a 60M euro transfer (LOL). Weird, I mostly have heard people say you got him for 35 fixed. I actually forgot it went up to 70 because that's how I've mostly seen it mentioned since. The same way Nunez keeps bashing the goal post Nonsense, it was the opposite of that for Haaland. Everyone kept saying how much a deal City got getting him for only 70m or whatever when the reported package went up to well over 100m with fees to his dad and sign on bonus's Ftfy, same result. The fee was €30m, he was 18 and he needed the development so we loaned him out for 2 seasons. Coincidentally Bastoni, who at 18 cost €31m, was also loaned out for 2 seasons, turned out both clubs were right to loan them out. You are wrong. 35+25 and the taxes. Smalling used to be a decent footballer overall, but the amount of times I've seen him take two steps back and pivot to the side to pass with his right, rather than pass 10 yards with his left... Man just didn't have it in him after LvG told him he couldn't pass a ball. Atleast use his full name...Mike fucking Smalling! Have you heard United have just bought Leny Yoro for 17.8 billion pounds on a 47 year contract at 630 million pounds per week? I understand the addons are in the region of £70. Definitely not, we still need to generate funds and cut the wage bill from sales (hopefully Goretzka, Gnabry, Coman and Upamecano).  You guys just got the greatest defender to ever play the game (Yoro obviously); we could have Baresi in our defence and it wouldn’t matter bc of Upamecano. You keep comparing the United defense to that Arsenal one when it’s no way near similar. Utd in 2022-2023 was tied for 2nd in fewest goals given up in the prem at 43 with Arsenal of all teams. That was Licha’s healthy season and Varane played a lot too. No one is asking Yoro to save this defense, he can grow into the team in 1-2 years and create a dynamic backline with licha.   United is probably signing another CB and if not, going with licha and Maguire with Yoro eased in and then Lindelof and Evans for rotation. It’s not MUFC debt though. It’s the Glazers.   MUFC is one of the only clubs in world football that actually generates profit from its traditional revenue streams. (Ie, without additional owner investment) So United got him for 62. You don’t see people saying Madrid got Endrick for 60 do you? Including bonuses is a bizarre way to represent transfer sums seeing as some of them may never get paid. They literally lowballed Lille. The selling price is set by the selling club not the other way around. Florentino just got used to players twerking for Madrid and he gambled on Yoro waiting it out for them and lost.   Objectively it is a Madrid loss because they were the front runners during this whole saga. They lost out on a massive talent that wanted to join them. I subscribe to the mindset of always overrated if you play for an English team, but a wonderkid if from Ligue 1 and my knowledge consists of highlight packages. Thank you for giving an actual answer unlike others. When you say we don’t know whether he’s anyrhing other than hype, do you mean that in the sense he hasn’t proved it for a world class team yet? Because he was a starter at Lille already Thank you for giving an actual answer unlike others. When you say we don’t know whether he’s anything other than hype, do you mean that in the sense he hasn’t proved it for a world class team yet? Because he was a starter at Lille already Ignore my flair. This is a genuine question. Can you name them because I don’t know of others. Except he is factually and statistically #1 in every relevant metric for u21 CBs? Lol Can you name them then? Name them. Van Dijk was not a generational talent when he was young lol, he was a late bloomer Van Dijk💀💀💀💀💀  A generational talent and a world class defender are not the same thing mate. And if you seriously meant to say Van Dijk was a generational talent, then you’re an absolute idiot and have no say on this matter  You need to look up what generational talent means before coming for people Could be wrong but I believe all of those players were older than 18 when they made their international debuts. Van Dijk? Mate, he was playing at Southampton well into his 20s. Great contribution to the discussion mate! They were willing to pay what they thought branthwaite was worth to them and they paid what they think yoro is worth to them.   They obviously value yoro more than branthwaite. Whether they are right or wrong is irrelevant.   The only difference from previous years is that they are ready to walk away from deals they don’t like. So pointed out hypocrisy is bitterness? And its ironic, considering your point about Yoro is more bitter than anything i have posted. So context is what exactly? And its not directed against Everton evaluation.   Its for people who thought 50m bid for Everton defender who had 1 full PL season is laughable but 57m for Yoro is concerning. Evaluation is pretty much on who United values more and which player had more options. That context is very conveniently missed by you as well. Maybe its your bias that is making you oblivious  If it isn’t clear, United and Everton evaluation is based on their personal preference. But Reddit user evaluation is biased and hypocritical, if they think 50m for Branthwaite is laughable while 57m for Yoro is concerning Greenwood...what could've been if he wasn't a grade a cumstain of a human being Well yeah obviously, but there's a reason why clubs spend big money on youngsters. No shit things may get in the way or change but the assumption is you're buying into a player for the long haul even if the reality may be different. If he’s in the pretty good range he probably will. If he’s amazing then they’ll sell him for a huge profit, but it’s pretty rare for United to have top end talent poached, Ronaldo aside. Maybe if you could actually read you could respond better to my original comment.   Spending 60m on an unproven 18 yr old, with 1 year left on his contract is mental.   RM are the gold standard for elite clubs purchasing players over the last 10 years, they wouldn’t go above 25m.  MUFC come in and offer over double for a player that didn’t want to go there.   This clearly it up for you, or do you still want to talk about random transfers with no relevance to the topic? Probably United is not exactly the same club it was even this time last year. Judging the club that is having a complete overhual by it's recent past and expecting more of the same is just choosing to be negative. There's not a new coach/manager in who going to get new players in that just fit his system and that henders the progress of the young players bought before. Idk, I'd rather be cautiously optimistic becuase so much is now different. I wouldn't at all be suprised to see Maguire start at RCB as Yoro is eased in. Of course there is expectation, but i don't see us throwing him in at the deep end. My point was, we do tend to be pretty good with handling youth players right now regardless of fees. When a player like Mainoo looks completely at ease, then they become starters.   Hojlund was signed for similar fee, and i don't think thats had any real impact on him. Expectation is there regardless, and 70m is the going rate for best in class youth players. Only pressure comes when it's a clear overpay like antony / maguire. Would we sell mainoo now for 70m? Hell no... Mainoo is a good example of a clearly talented player that has been eased in, proved himself, and recently gone from nothing to starting Euro 2024 final, bossing the midfield in an FA cup win etc. If they prove themselves, they play. He won't be a starter immediately. He will be eased in like Tchouameni. Who you paid more for Stories you made up.   Including add-ons for AWB, because of reasons   United didn't pay more than 40 for martial bcos he didn't achieve any of the major add-ons. Weird to call that a fortune Number 9s are on a bigger premium than CBs and yet Endrick, who is one, was apparently still cheaper than Yoro, with Lille being guaranteed way more money for a player on the last year of his contract. Even PSG was reportedly unwilling to go higher than 45M. Kudos to United—hope he does well there—but keep in mind Madrid have never signed a defender for more than 50M, proven or unproven, so I don’t think there is any universe where they would have gotten even close to these numbers, assuming they’re true.  70m is a hell of a price obviously. Nasser tried going directly to the owner of Lille because the relationship with Letang is not the strongest and after that we pulled out of the race.   I think the fee will be worth it in the long way as long as he gets moderate minutes the first season Rupiah>>>> Yeah for sure we need to put in a stricter wage structure He had just turned 22, and Arsenal was also willing to pay that expensive fee... No one reports transfers including agent fees because it’s in the best interests of agents/clubs to not draw attention to just how much money they’re getting. I mean, that was his release clause. That is what Dortmund got. The comissions are not part of the fee.     You don't believe you arent paying a bunch of comissions to Mendes to convince Yoro to go and play Europa league, do you? u seem confused: u pay 62+8 optional +agent fee Do you have a player who can even get it close to the post? 52 million pound RC, 350k wages over 5 years and 35 mil agent fees. It’s simple. And no everyone piled on the “you’re a fool if you think it’s only that much”. Lol a bunch of nonsense Sure, but your fans (the majority) didnt agree. Theres never a guarantee that loans work out as well. Why are you reporting the taxes? Are these taxes you pay in every transfer?  Or are you paying the taxes that Palmeiras would have had to pay? If so then it really should just be added onto the transfer fee lol You are right, had to look it up That’s just for comparisons sake though. Again, this ain’t an attack on anyone, I knew the moment I brought up being a fan of another team, it was gonna be all about the pseudo-ad hominem about Arsenal.  But even so, to your point 58, 43, 57, 44, and 36 gc in the last 5 seasons (36 gc in 2019/20 is fantastic tho, for sure) are not that impressive for the last couple seasons for a team like United. Even the 20/21 season with 44 gc, when they finished 2nd, that is still 5 more than Arsenal conceded that season when we finished 8th. My point with this is that, they aren’t really that crazy defensively especially when that defense comes in place of a great attack (57, 58, 57, 73, and 66 goals scored the last 5 seasons). Again, I’m not attacking the team, because this isn’t about doing that. Even the season you brought up, yes they conceded a great 43 goals, they only scored 58 - which 7 teams in the league did better. The attack being stifled to support the defense is imo even worse than if they were great in attack but very leaky. To which I say again, the image of “they will ruin another CB” doesn’t come from United being garbage or fans being ignorant, but from the fact that they have, again, spent €220m on a defense that probably could be justified to your fans, but from an outsider view, all we see is an average of 1.38 goals conceded per game in the last 3 years (still better than 1.49 gc/game, but literally double the 0.77 gc/game that the best team in the league had over those seasons had)   But I guess since the original comment DIDNT specifically say “No matter which CB, we signed we can’t win.” maybe me trying to rationalize why people think they can’t win here is very wrong of me after all especially bc I can relate to it myself coming from a fan of a team with very bad luck defensively huh?   Sorry for this rambling, jesus this was an actual essay. What I'm seeing is that you have no idea about how any of that works, and especially no idea about how Madrid operates. I guess it's cooler to make up a scenario out of nowhere and run with it, more drama that way, eh?   Bellingham was bought for 100 million with 2 years left on his contract. Vinicious and Rodrygo were criticised for their transfer fees, Endrick will arrive for no less than their fees. Madrid have no problem paying.       Yes, the selling price is set by a club but it doesn't mean it has to be matched and that anything below that is a lowball. If Madrid and Flo wanted Yoro at all costs, it would have been done very swiftly. If Yoro isn't a Madrid player it's because he wasn't deemed as must have. Good for Lille getting what they wanted but that narrative is utter crap.   I don't expect you to undense your mind though so whatever. Turning notifications off for this thread cause it's childish. One of the main qualities in generational talents is consistency.   Many players have one or two incredible seasons, and then they return to their average.   Players who play out of this world their entire careers and are generational, well there is like 1-5 of them. Guessing who it will be at 18 is a lotery, and finding old lists of wonderkids shows this very clearly. Most of them do not pan out. They are good, but they are not gonna be in team of the season or ballon d'or conversations I mean that in the sense he’s 18, he’s still developing mentally and physically. We have no evidence he’s generational. We just know and some have watched him play 1 season at a decent level with really good physical attributes.   The calls for generational land 1/10 times maybe. So in truth. It’s a silly thing to say until they are “generational” You acquire the term ”generational talent” like half ways through your career, when you have already proved that you are THAT good over a number of years at the highest level and there’s no sign of decline in your future. Cubarsí, Scalvini, Silva, Hato, Quansah, the Brazillian dude from PSG How does this matter? I can compare Quansah and van Dijk’s stats last season and Quansah looks competitive with him.   Not to mention he is playing in the weakest of the top 5 leagues. He’s the most turbulent age to be a footballer at 18/19 in regards to injury and attitude, he could be a good buy but you’re setting yourself up for disappointment if you think you’re just slotting in a “generational” CB directly into your squad. Publicly available CB metrics are garbage. Even more so when judging young defenders. Cubarsí, Scalvini, Silva, Hato, Quansah, the Brazillian dude from PSG Cubarsí, Scalvini, Silva, Hato, Quansah, the Brazillian dude from PSG I’m sorry so you think Yoro IS a generational talent but also Van Dijk ISNT? Lmfao you can’t have both those be true Yeah and it was too early to say they were generational talents at that age.   Everyone just needs to chill and be patient. I wonder if Ruud Van Nistelrooy's opinion of Braithwaite swayed the decision to go for Yoro. Because valuation doesnt just go off what you feel like it being? Branthwaite has 3x longer left on his contract, is English, and has played in the premier league. These three things make him more valuable, which is why people laughed at the awful United bid. Dude unproven in EPL sure, but proven in ligue 1.  He was in their team of the season and he's just 18.  The dude can kick a ball in ligue 1 and needs to prove in EPL but at 18 he has immense potential to grow in football and can bulk up for EPL.  And 60m because real wanted him and United has to pay up because they don't have Real Madrid pull.  All in all, everything from Reals interest to his ligue performances and that he is 18 proves he can really perform if the right conditions are around him. I’m not saying you can’t be optimistic. Just that with the evidence at hand it’s not “weird” that some United fans are worried. 70m is the going rate for youth players? What? Our second offer would have been 30+10. According to PSG fans in this thread they valued him at 40+5. You guys went ahead and threw the kitchen sink at a kid with an expiring contract....   You are not fighting for anything if Maguire is still starting for you guys at the start of next season. You mean 22 year old Tchouameni who has had multiple seasons of first team football at 2 teams behind him, and who was already a regular in the french national team? That Tchouameni? Who also had multiple years left on his contract? We paid 80+ bonuses for him... you are paying 62+bonuses for the unproven teenager with 11 months left on his contract.    Also, Tchouameni wasn't eased in, he was a starter straight away until his injury in january, when Carlo started dropping him for the biggest games of the season. His form dropped and Carlo went with experience. Wrongly, btw. Did he play for free then yeah Vietnam Dong That has been one for the main focus of INEOS, cost cutting across the board. If I remember correctly, Amad hit the post against you in the final minute Pretty ironic given how bad Nunez and Diaz are in front of goal as well as Salah being pretty bad in the last half of the season. [deleted] Every other season Rashford manages over 20, so probably him this season They were saying that because the reported fee was consistently only 52m. Which was NOT the actual fee. 35m in agent fees is a fucking disgrace. How do you know it was a majority of Arsenal fans? There's millions of us. There are a lot of different opinions within every fanbase. 'Arsenal fans' aren't a monolith.  >  Theres never a guarantee that loans work out as well.  That extends to everything... You know for how much you guys win, Madrid fans on this sub are insecure as fuck. Go off and cry now then. Well spoken. I agree.  As for your last point, I think De Ligt is a great example. Not saying everybody saw him as a generational talent, but enough people thought so. Played a Europa League final at 17, youngest Ajax captain ever, led the team to a Champions League semi finals at 19 etc.  He has now played for 2 big clubs in Juventus and Bayern, yet I doubt anyone would say he has lived up to the potential of being a generational talent so far. Could go the same for Leny Yoro Generally I agree, but in this case it makes more sense to limit the pool of the “lottery” to 18 year old players who have played a full season of top flight football and done well. Let’s not act like there are many 18 year olds who have made the team of the season for their league in the first season. You seriously slipped in Quansah there, lol Let's completely ignore United here for a second. Madrid and Liverpool wanted him as a priority as well but weren't willing to pay nearly as much as we did, if I'm not wrong he was linked with PSG as well. Liverpool have a data driven approach to signings and Madrid have mostly been spot on when it comes to transfers lately so it's not just United who think he has that level of talent. The narrative around him seems to have changed ever since United got into the driving seat with this transfer, as it happens with every other transfer of ours lately. It matters that it debunks the baseless claim that there are 5-6 CBs around his age who are ""as good or better"" when he clearly stands at the top of every stat for his age bracket, has been heavily chased by Madrid, PSG, Liverpool and United, and is the only CB in the top 5, and one of only 2 CBs in the top 10 Golden Boy shortlist. ie that comment is bullshit, and that's the comment I'm replying to.       I don't care about the ""Quansah is better anyway"" narrative that Liverpool fans have started pushing now that you've missed out on him. Time will tell. Obviously he's a risk like every young teenager with great potential. But he was the hottest defender prospect  in the world 2 days ago when he ""only wanted Madrid"" and now he's shit and a bad signing cause United got him.       Also, sure Ligue 1 is the weakest of the top 5 leagues, but it's a fantastic breeding ground for talent. Your own Fabinho came from there, Some of the current big players in the PL Bruno G, Paqueta (RIP) Arsenal's Saliba and Gabriel, others like Kounde or Doku, Leao, Bernando Silva etc... Madrid got Varane from there, Tchouameni, Mendy and Camavinga, Yoro was next.. Good thing top teams like Madrid, United, Liverpool and PSG use their own internal metrics to evaluate players and they all judged him to be good eh? Quansah will go back to 3rd or 4th choice this season, who knows with Hato, Ajax were appalling last season. Scalvini is 2 years older so you’d expect him to be better at this stage, same with Silva. The only comparable one is Cubarsi. First of all, I didn’t say Leny Yoro is a generational talent, I just asked the person above me why they think he isn’t.  Second, you’re making the exact same mistake as the guy above me now, you idiot.   A generational talent is a young player whose quality and/or potential exceeds that of his peers in the same age group. They are such talents that they only break through once in a generation. Think Lamine Yamal. Some people only call a handful of players a generational talent, while others like to appoint one for each position in a generation. Either way, the difference doesn’t matter for this conversation  Now you understand what a generational talent is, are you seriously going to imply that Van Dijk was a generational talent? Not someone with talent, not someone with the most talent for a certain position from a specific generation, not a world class defender, but a *generational talent*  If you think Van Dijk was a generational talent then you are admitting that you have only started watching football in the past 5 years, or alternatively, know absolutely fuck all about Virgil’s career before getting to Liverpool.   He was never a generational talent. None of the top Dutch clubs even wanted Virgil when he was 22 and still at Groningen, so he went to Celtic. They were obviously very wrong about that and he managed to create his own path, but that doesn’t suddenly mean he was a generational talent in retrospect. From that point it still took him another 5 years or so before he got to Liverpool Is Yoro a generational talent? idk, I've never even seen him play truthfully. But VVD was definitely never one. He became world class late into his career, but generational talent? Never. I mean, Maldini debuted for the main team when he was 16 and in the next season proceeded to make 40 appearances, for a much better team in a much better league. As I said in the previous comment, it was probably just a simple case of player evaluation. The had bid £50m for Braithwaite and would have probably gone up to £60m. But Everton wanted £80m.  They signed Yoro for like £58m including bonuses. They probably think Yoro had a higher ceiling too. They are interested because of Ruud You’re just agreeing with what I said now, yet chose to make yourself look a fool by quoting some other weird transfers that have no relevance.   MUFC have done for years, overpaid transfer fee and wages. That’s what my point was.  Many players have flopped coming from the French league to the PL. Re-read my post. 70m euro is the market rate for best in class youth players. You think we would accept an offer of below 70m for mainoo? Bellingham was 100m. I'm saying times have changed, 70m euro is not crazy for a player regarded as one of the best prospects in the world in his position.  And what you offer is irrelevant. As that offer was declined... A market price is set when a buyer and seller agree a fee. Valuations and bids do not set value.   Maguire will become 2nd choice behind yoro, but i wouldn't be suprised to see yoro eased in / rotated. Unless the staff see he is 100% mentally ready Yes. That Tchouameni. There's only one in the RM team. The number of years left in the contract has no relevance. Both clubs paid high for their players cos they weren't confident of landing him later. And the players won't be a starter immediately at both clubs. If no other high profile CB arrives at United this summer, Maguire will start beside Lisandro, as long as Maguire is fit. The wages being a problem was not your initial point though, but the fees. So well done, you just beat your own argument. Zimbabwean dollars 🤤 He should've seen that one coming.              So should Kelleher. This reply just gave me the smile I needed for the rest of the day. Well done mate you're killed him That’s the last thing that was heard from him. Nunez had more goal involments than like 90% of the league.  So did salah. I doubt that, my mother has been dead since 2006 Shame on anyone reporting a 52 mil RC was paid. And buddy if you think the agent fees were included in every article you need to learn to read past the headline. 35 mil in agent fees is disgusting. What happens when you get a 200 mil player for 52 million. Well, there was a time when after 3 loan spells, he had two years left on his contract whilst being scouted by several big clubs. At that time he had no connection to Arsenal after not playing for them and only being sent out on loan. How is it insecure he's just explaining how the offer wasn't a ""lowball"" and the other dude just replied with ""go cry"" lmao. But this is expected, Man U fans need some wins like these during the transfer period because they will inevitably implode within the 1st half of the season. De ligt is a perfect example of the too early generational shouts. Regardless of how good. He “could be generational”. Tbf it's hard to justify that title while playing in some clubs. In Madrid he could have been heir to Ramos&Varane. But Juventus and all their shennanigans, and Bayern with zero competition in league... No it hasn’t. Nobody is disputing the potential he has as a player, people are disputing how risky an investment this is. You are correct in that Liverpool has its data driven approach to transfers and Madrid is generally spot on with talent ID, and neither were comfortable paying anything near what you guys did for him. Because at the end of the day every transfer incurs risk, this one especially so considering he is unproven with only one season in a weaker league.  Just for us, if we beat your offer he would become our 2nd most expensive CB in our club’s history behind VVD, and would be amongst our highest earning players at the club immediately at 18, I don’t see how that’s reasonable considering he would be at best a 3rd choice option for us behind VVD, Konate and Quansah. 'Liverpool have a data driven approach to signings and Madrid have mostly been spot on when it comes to transfers lately'  If those two teams who like you said are data driven or just have great eyes for talent pulled out due to the price, would that not tell you something? I have never seen him play so I couldn't tell you if he will be a world beater but surely if he was 'Generational' there would be a bidding war no? But you’re just ignoring my point that stats can’t objectively tell you how good or bad a player is? I wasn’t even arguing Quansah is better, I was making a point that when using stats alone you can legitimately compare him to VVD which we know is nonsense.  He wasn’t “heavily” chased by all those clubs. Madrid were very hands off with him, basically telling him to wait on them because they weren’t gonna pay insane money for an unproven 18 year old with 1 year on his contract. Liverpool had similar qualms about not wanting to make him our 2nd most expensive CB ever and a squad top earner immediately at 18.  You’re mentioning talents that came from Ligue 1, I’m aware players from there have succeeded. Let’s take Saliba as the most similar example, Arsenal were patient with his development and loaned him out for experience, you guys will be putting Yoro straight into the pressure cooker starting for united which is likely not the best approach for his development. Clubs are wrong all the time. There are a lot of intangibles at play.  Also, Madrid, Liverpool etc. seem to have valued at him a lot lower amount. Doesn't mean he won't be good (I haven't seen much of him to be honest) but ""statistically the best for U21 CBs"" by itself means nothing in the grand scheme of things. Yes, behind two very good senior defenders. Yoro would be 3rd/4th choice too.  Who knows with Yoro? French league is shit.   Older but still U21.   Point behing is he's not a generational talent. Generational talents have no one comparable. You cooked him I wasn’t saying that Van Dijk is a generational talent. I actually think you have to have years at the top to be considered one and being world class does not mean a generational talent, it’s even a step ahead. I’m saying if we are loose enough to call Yoro a generational talent, then we also need to include Van Dijk in that conversation due to his career at Liverpool.  In my opinion, Yoro has the potential to be a generational talent but the majority of players that do never make that step up. That’s what makes the very few that do generational Why? Source? Lol   The only thing I understand from my conversation with you is that if a guy with an agenda in denial replies to your first comment with denial it's best to let it be instead of stooping to his level. Adios. Bellingham was Bundesliga player of the year, 1-2 year older, more experienced, a midfielder and very marketable. You wouldn't sell Mainoo for that, but he is also not in his last year of his contract and you are not Lille.   What others valued him is very much relevant. You overpaid for him. That is a simple fact. Lille asked for an unrealistic fee and United was the only club willing to pay it.   We bought Camavinga in the exact same situation for half of what you paid for Yoro. 18, last year of his contract, 2 seasons of pro football. That was our baseline for this deal. The contract length absolutely has relevance, wtf. Are you new to how football transfers work?    We bought Tchouameni, because we needed him. Casemiro alteady told Florentino he wants to leave when we signed him.   You still avoid addressing the fact that Tchouameni was a much more proven player. Tchouameni was also a starter for us straight away, he had the 8th highest amount of minutes for us that season. I literally said 'Time and time again United have paid big fees and big wages for young players and it hasn't worked out' so I don't know why you're lying. Nigerian Naira Well done mate you are killed him Warra trophy for Liverpool Nunez had 1 more goal than Højlund in the league by the way. Rip He‘s a United supporter. You never know how low he drops… And it all worked out. Yup. No one's saying he's rubbish, just he's not a generational talent.  Mbappe was a generational talent. Yamal is one. WZE/Estevao are probably the closest behind them, but still wouldn't peg them as that. Yoro is not. I didn't ignore your point, I am saying the top experts in the sport rate him as a generational talent, with him being wanted by the biggest clubs in the world and ranking so highly for awards like the Golden Boy which is a good indicator for young players' levels. I'm saying the recognition is backed up by the stats, so even if you ignore stats there is still the fact thattop clubs who have way more scouts and way more in depth data have clearly signaled the kid is the real deal. I haven't seen Quansah turn any heads outside of already existing Liverpool fans and he's 3 years older than Yoro, so I don't think it's a similar situation.        Ornstein himself said both United \*\*and\*\* Liverpool were ""pushing hard"" for Yoro. Madrid went as far as to put in a bid. I don't know how much more you want to confirm someone is being ""heavily chased"" than Tier 1 confirmation and an officially submitted bid. Only difference is, Madrid were relying on their stellar reputation to get these players for cheap or on a free, especially after signing Mbappe on a free which cost them an arm and a leg in wages and agent fees. That's their transfer strategy, they just rely on players wanting to play for them and make them run out their contracts. Madrid is the only club in the world with the prestige to do that.       Liverpool got discouraged the moment they saw Madrid is interested and that he wants them back (Tchouameni trauma maybe?) and I'm not sure but I don't think you guys have made any moves in the market at all yet so I dunno what you're doing, but we just moved first, called Real's bluff and won. You want to spin it as United overpaying for an unproven 18 year old then go right ahead, we always hear that and it has been true in the past (although more for aging hasbeens rather than promising prospects) but this is a good signing for us and a player most top teams would've loved to sign. Also, he's not close to being a top earner for us, not only are his reported wages only mentioned by low tier journalists, even \*\*if\*\* they are accurate it's still a big step down from what we were paying Varane or Martial who are now off the books, and replaced by younger players for the future on way lower wages.       Speaking of Varane, since you're cherry picking Saliba as the example of a staggered development with patient loans instead of going into the ""pressure cooker"" straight away, I'll use Rapha as someone who was starting games for Madrid at 18 and that guy did quite well I'd say. We're clearly still not on the level Madrid was when he joined, we are a new project under a new management and no one really knows what the plan is. We can sign deLigt next week and have them both rotating next season. It's all speculation. We don't know, but regardless, Saliba played 1400' mins at 18 when Arsenal got him. Then 1900' mins for Nice the next season at 19. It took him 3 loans to reach 3000' mins of senior football in Ligue 1 before he was finally deemed ready to play for Arsenal. Yoro already played almost 3700 mins this season for Lille at 18. We've all seen Garnacho's rise, then Kobbie Mainoo's. Both broke through into the pressure cooker at 18. I trust Erik and our club to manage the kid and take care of him and develop him. It means \*something\* when you couple it with the fact that he was wanted by these clubs and if no one else, I'd trust Real's talent ID for young players (Madrid is cheap and use their pull to get young players to run out their contracts, Liverpool is weird this window and hasn't made any moves plus they got spooked by Madrid's interest apparently and didn't even bother trying to bid at all so you don't know what their valuation is, his MV on Transfermarkt is set at €50m before this transfer is confirmed).       Again, my comment was in answer to the bold claim there are 5-6 CBs his age who are as good or better. The op failed to mention a single name when challenged. And the only other CB on the top 10 short list of the Golden Boy award is Barca's Cubarsí. If stats aren't enough, concrete interest from the best clubs in the world isn't enough, and recognition by the leading experts in the field who rate him higher than all his peers isn't enough, then I dunno what else to tell you.     Maybe it's hard to be objective when a rival club pulls something like this off. I wonder if we'd see the same narratives being pushed if he did end up at Madrid instead. All I'll say is let's just wait and see how it goes, kid hasn't even put on the shirt yet and some rivals (not you) are already calling him a flop and laughing at United for 'overpaying'. You have no idea if he’s a generational talent yet. Alternatively, Van Dijk is one of the best defenders of his generation, thus his talent is generational. It’s all semantics anyways Cooked himself by choosing that example. Many other examples they could’ve chosen from that would’ve been better > I wasn’t saying that Van Dijk is a generational talent  Really?  > I’m sorry so you think Yoro IS a generational talent but also Van Dijk ISNT? Lmfao you can’t have both those be true  > but also Van Dijk ISNT? If United waited another year, they wouldn't get Yoro. So there being only 1 year left doesn't make a difference compared to other similar transfers. The premium is paid to secure the deal. He played more mins in Ligue 1 than Tchouameni did in any of his seasons. He is proven enough. He will be eased in at United. Killed him? Well, mate. You are done. correct Thats fine. Lets do all comps. What you say might all be true. Or not, I don't know. Like I said, I haven't watched the player, so I'm not commenting on it.  I'm just saying that stats for CBs are garbage. Even more so for younger CBs. Lol no he isn't. I can think of 3 defenders better than him from his generation. So you agree that you massively over paid for an unproven talent then? Good talk. Yeah two more goals, mate. Let’s hear it? Atta boy. At this rate, you'll one day understand how words work. Keep at it. Im talking about goal involments not goals. Nunez has 31 and hojlund has 18 Varane, Ramos and De vrij of the top of my head. How is assists relevant for a player hitting the target or not?"

Reality is, we do need a second centre half signing though.  Varane being let go, Kambala being sold and open to offers on Victor means another centre half has to come in.  Could just be playing hardball with Bayern or may actually favour getting Jarrod (though not willing to pay his price).  Maybe there's another option out there, Tah from Leverkusen? We don't want to spend £50m on De Ligt, so we're spending £50m on an 18yo instead? Don't get me wrong he seems like a talent, but I just feel like De Ligt is worth the money more than Yoro is at this time. De Ligt is worth the money and fits them like a glove, specially since they are signing a promising but still green CB in Yoro. This is just juggling negotiations and finances, I believe in the end he will be a United player. Such a statement signing from Ineos. Incredible signing.   Zirkzee and Yoro being the first signings in the new reign is very exciting. LETS FUCKING GOOOOO Hope he stays and shows how fucking good he is, most fans want him to stay.   Also great to see that Real finally doesn't succeed every time with this bullshit. My only concern with de ligt is whether he would solve the passing out from the back issue or not.  Anyone who has watched him regularly got anything to say about his ability to pass under pressure? Fuck me sideways and call me Shelley if we get another Kroos situation and De Ligt ends up at Real. This will come back and haunt us. 🫠 GETTT INNN Spending more on Yoro than De Ligt is actual insanity  Don’t do this, don’t give me hope… For those saying the concern is about wages, De Ligt is a proven defender in multiple leagues, not yet in his prime and has got desired qualities like being able to comfortably play with the ball, strong leadership, strong aerial presence in both defending/attacking. Can also resist player from pressing, intelligent movement off the ball.   After seeing United throw silly money at average players for years, funny how they now have concerns when it comes to him. They’re kind of throwing silly money at Yoro who’s 18 - but when Real Madrid are chasing him then there must be something really good in him.  I know De Ligt has injury concerns, but it’s better than the likes of Varane and Shaw but not elite like Bruno. They are manageable and I reckon he can play about 34-38 games a season.    All I know is that it won’t be shocking if Real Madrid swoop in for De Ligt in this transfer window if they don’t end up with Yoro. He can fit in their backline comfortably seeing that Bayern aren’t putting much of a resistance to keep him. H O L D Please stay and become our future captain Mathijs 🤌🏾 Typical United policy at this point. They punted on an aged CR7 and Casemiro and decided enough was enough for spending on established players I think we sell Lindy and reinvest in De Light though Lindy is our only true LCB backup...so not sure how this works? Please Newcastle, just try. I don’t love the De Ligt deal - I think Martinez, Yoro and Maguire is pretty solid with more than enough cover from Shaw, Evans and Lindelof. I’d rather put that 50M towards strengthening RB  and DM. But that means Dalot/AWB leaving first.   Also, I worry about LW/RW - we have Sancho, Rashford, Garnacho, Amad and Antony but they are almost copies of each other in play style. Mixing that up would be beneficial. But not sure who on that list would be sold.. Us (Liverpool) should be all over him So we'll pay way over the odds for a wonderkid who'll be off to madrid in 5 years? instead of a world class defender who wants to come in MDL? fuck sake, not happy about this Ah damn Ig we gotta keep him now, how unfortunate. Liverpool? If they pull this off good on them. But I still wonder if real Madrid aren't going to come flying in off the top rope and snatch him. We definitely need another CB, but this is a great strategy by United to try get the price down by a player who seemed to have his eyes on OT already. This is the sort of shit Chelsea are great at doing, may as well act like a big boy in the game if we are big boys in the game, Ineos have played this summer so well An established experienced player and a young potential talent.  I don't think the two are mutually exclusive somehow. 50m is really good price. Wonder why other clubs are not going after him So they would not spend that money on someone who actually has a big experience and played for big teams but spend on an 18 yrs old kid who plays in Ligue 1 , yes this sounds like United to me. At the same time you're gonna have to wonder why nobody seems to want such a great player. scenes when jim ratcliffe adds his name to the signatories  the man is already thinking three years ahead to when bayern's inability to offload de ligt's wages and ongoing kane-induced trophy drought has sunk them financially to the point where they are forced to sell all their best talent for peanuts Ornstein said this “The Premier League team maintain their admiration for options such as Matthijs de Ligt of Bayern Munich and Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite, although a further arrival is likely to depend on departures to create finance and squad space.”   This is where the Greenwood sale helps I imagine. Think we have to sell now before we can bring anyone else in I feel they prefer Branthwaite but i dont see Everton selling unless we give them what they want They would have to meet Evertons price tag. Think it was reported that with the sale of Onana they don't have to sell Branthwaite and intended on keeping him. Don't see him going without united overpaying.   Edit: Yeah, on the Orny tweet from the Onana sale he states it all but ends any chance of Branthwaite being sold barring a huge bid Doubt it. I think it was Yoro OR Branthwaite. We might want De Ligt for his other characteristics, but there's no way we will pay the 70-80m minimum Everton want. Fuck I really wish we go for De Ligt over Jarrad. We need that experienced brute. I don't want Yoro and Jarrad to be in the limelight and under scrutiny as much. I feel De ligt can handle that. Plus he's proven and experienced. Branthwaite is gonna close more than this I imagine from Everton, personally I think De Light for now is the much better option proven over the years and well worth the cost for Utd. Man United wouldn’t entertain coming close to the £70m asking price  If they think we’re going to entertain anything lower than £70m after Man United have just spent like £55m on an 18 year old with one year left on his deal then they’ve lost the plot  It’s have to be a ridiculous deal for us to sell  We already want to sell Holgate and Keane after already selling Godfrey  Which would leave us with Branthwaite and Tarkowski as our only 2 centre backs If another CB were to be signed, I'd bet it'd be a left footed one to cover Martinez.  Hence the Branthwaite interest that was in parallel with MDL/Yoro, who are both right footed.  What I'm worried about is that there are no new rumors regarding DM. Ugarte rumors have quieten down, hope they pick up again after Copa finished. [deleted] Two that I'd feel would be realistic and are left footed are Murillo from Forest and then Hancko (also covers left back then). They'd come in a lot cheaper than Branthwaite The zirkzee sale gave 50% to bayern as a good bargaining chip, so we might get de ligt Tah went to bayern already but the 18 yo wont have the wages of de ligt. de light would be looking for 200k per week awhile yoro wont be remotely similar You have to consider total spend over the life of the contract. It's probably safe to assume it would be much less for Yoro considering his wages are presumably lower than De Ligt As one who could contribute to you immediately, maybe not but total cost (transfer fee + salary + commissions) and future sale value makes Yoro a more appetizing deal. Still expect you guys to buy another CB, Lisandro - Yoro - Maguire CB rotation seems slim and honestly worse than other top 4 competitors Yeah. De Ligt is literally the exact type of player Man U need. They need guys with character and leadership.  The price they were gonna spend on him was insanely low for this market too. Would have been great business.   Yeah bit of a strange one. Varane wages are gone too. I would say they are also as cynical as it sounds, are thinking of how he clearly sees himself as a Madrid player eventually that this future sale if he becomes world class like many think he could be. That future sale is gonna be massive. An actual sensible response for once. Yoro is geniuenly better than de ligt lol We can sell Yoro in 3 years' time for double this price. That's not possible with deligt. I know that's not 'big club' behaviour, but we are not really a 'big club' any more. Need to be smart financially. This way we get a world class prospect playing for us while also securing a big sale option for the future. This is a very Brighton like deal. [deleted] I get that yoro is 18 and so good at such a young age but for the same price wouldnt u rather have de ligt a proven amazing defender who is just 24 and has a great personality as a captain at the age of 19 ... Can any of them pedal fast? Well another update says, we still want one more cb and that's dependent on sales He was mediocre in that regard for Bayern. My straight answer is no. He’s rather safe with the ball and will look to distribute it immediately to the nearest man. Once in a while he’ll make a decent pass between the line but still his movements looks kinda stiff, and don’t expect him to run forward with the ball (could be a coaching thing). And if he’s the LCB then I’m not that confident if we have to face, say Man City or Arsenal press  He’s a great pure defender though, so with a complimentary piece and not much build up responsibility he’s your man. A great vocal leader as well Martinez is great on the ball and passes under pressure, as long as he stays healthy I imagine he will be doing most of build up play from the back. Is Yoro better? I mean Yoro isn’t all that great at it either yet he is a lot more reserved on the ball upvoted for the use of the old English adage ""fuck me sideways and call me Shelly"" Yoro is a once in a few years opportunity, MDL we can probably put on hold for a few weeks until we've made a few sales. But De Ligt has had so many injury issues throughout his career, always a chance things get worse when he joins United, This is just a tactic. It's very simple, we can't buy MDL until we made a sale because we got Yoro, but now we play it off like we're not going through with the deal because of the fee. We wait a few weeks until we raise funds, go back to the negotiating table and get him for cheaper while we're at it. Real don't seem like they want to drop €50m on a defender, if they'd bid €40+10 they would have gotten Yoro over us easily.   Most likely they go for a cheaper alternative Who's Lindy? Yea yoro might be good but signing de ligt for this cheap would be a way better deal imo. De ligt is only 24, its not like he is old there are reasons why managers don't want him (basically he's not a modern centerback and gets paid too much for what he brings to the table) but reddit hivemind loves him and doesn't accept that. The idea of bayern, the club known to be managed super well (up until recent times), falling into mediocrity because of the Kane curse is so funny to me Jim Ratcliffe is a billionaire tax-avoiding Brexiteer, who's also one of the worst men I've had the misfortune to meet when I was a union convener at one of his companies. Acting like he's some genius is disgusting. Squad space could imply we might have to sell some CBs too We want to convince Jose to buy Lindelof too.   I think we were hoping the Sancho sale could be combined with Greenwood money to make a move for Toney but Sancho appears to be staying for the time being, probably because Juve were never going to offer proper money for him.   So there isn't really room for 2 €50m defenders in the squad, but we still need younger, better cover for Licha imo More like getting a decent price for Maguire or Lindelof, I think. We tried selling Maguire last year and couldn't agree a price with West Ham and we've been offering Lindelof around this summer.   Licha, Yoro, Maguire, Lindelof and Evans is fine. Knowing our injuries problems it probably won't be, but it's hard to justify another €50m CB until another one is sold. Is this what it's like to be run properly? We also got news that west ham is interested in AWB and few are looking at Mctominay. If they get sold it would give us more room to work with. I need Casemiro gone yesterday, we need a midfielder so badly. Think we still have the funds to replace Amrabat. Then we’ve filled the spots of the three players that left at the end of the season.  Then we’re into ‘sell to upgrade’ territory I think  We've been very stern on the fee and haven't budged at all which is good to see because we always seem to fold. With the Onana sale being inevitable (IMO) I can't see us selling Branthwaite at all then unless an outrageous figure is thrown out. It was Branthwaite and Yoro/de Ligt. >after already selling Godfrey  Cant believe you sold the first Elden lord, big mistake understandable, see you next summer transfer window it's 41 million pound plus addons, why are you deliberately lying?? Why the downvoted but the most sensible take. I don't see Everton selling one of their best CBs this season if they don't need too. Now that onana is on his way out.   It would be nice for the league if Everton stays and also for Brainthwaite to stay at Everton. Out of interest, would you take 55m + Maguire for Branthwaite?  no ones paying 70m for Branthwaite lol, the kid's clearly very talented but there's probably a reason every top club was after Yoro and not Branthwaite, his real value is probably closer to 40-50m when you deduct the english tax I see people mention this, but it's not as if Zirkzee wouldn't have moved if not for us. Bayern were getting that 20m regardless. It was a sell-on clause, United or Milan or whoever was going to buy him were going to pay Bayern that much regardless. It's not a bargaining chip at all Why would that affect the De Ligt deal? It's not a bargaining chip, it has no influence at all They're not going to knock 20m off because we bought Zirkzee Its always these united fans. He hasn't, the ITKs are saying Bayern want to sell de Ligt first before going for Tah. Personal terms have reportedly been agreed to, though Also a fair point, I just think we need a De Ligt more than a Yoro right now. Hopefully we get both. Also Yoro has greater sell-on value. If he develops, we may be able to set a record fee for a defender if he wants to move somewhere else (he’s apparently a huge Real Madrid fan). De Ligt is still young but I don’t know of he will ever be more valuable than is today. Why are we acting like 200k is overpay for De Ligt? He's 24 this isn't like a Casemiro situation.   Even then, if there's one club that should not care about wages its United. I mean, Yoro’s gonna be on very high wages as well Exactly, and I would also assume that Ten Hag prefers Yoro. It's not like Yoro will be earning breadcrumbs. Its for 150k/week lol I don’t see the reason why you’re being downvoted.  Deligt is no better than he was 5 years ago. Yoro has more upside. I fear that you in fact cannot sell Yoro for 100 million lol. > but we are not really a 'big club' any more.  You literally have this backwards. Financially you are absolutely still a giant club and can afford any wages. But transfer wise yes you're not a big club, which is why you should be jumping at the chance to sign someone like De Ligt instead of worrying about the resale value of a 24 year old. Madness. Both clubs fan bases think he was their best CB..  My guess is the wages, but even then I would still have done it So, Ornstein says that we maintain our admiration for MDL and Branthwaite but we would need to sell in order to make more purchases so there's a chance we might still go for MDL.  This means we will most likely sell one of Lindelof, McTominay or Casemiro. Agreed. I’d rather have de Ligt. Plus the fact that he wants to come while Yoro wanted Madrid. I hope I’m wrong but I agree. He has potential but it’s a huge fucking risk. Has De Ligt improved from when he was 19? Tbf I don’t think deligt is an amazing defender. I need you guys to sign Branthwaite so badly Are you making a lot of money back potentially? Because right now just for your defense youre spending spending And Juve. Amazing defender though >so with a complimentary piece and not much build up responsibility he’s your man.  That would make De Ligt a perfect partner to Licha. Ah, yes, I'm a lot more confident with Upamecano facing Man City. But doesn’t that then become quite predictable, with all the passing going through one side of the pitch? Than De Ligt? Right now no tbh but Yoro is 18. Lindelof In the eredivisie subreddit people couldn't believe that United would pass on a world class centre back in favour of an 18 year old. Just goes to show people still have De Ligt from Ajax in their mind, he never really fulfilled that potential. It can happen to any club really. Dreams can’t be buy in years to come it will emerge that kane signed some kind of pact with the devil while he was on loan at norwich, blessing him with remarkable talent in exchange for never winning silverware  that's why he was strolling around so lazily in the final, he can see beelzebub in the stand shaking his head at him Yeah true. We’ll have too many cb’s. Probably Lindelof He might just be further down the list but as a casual observer it feels like they should be sniffing around David Hancko. Cheaper, and can cover LB. Although he may not want to be a rotation option.. >couldn't agree a price with West Ham   I thought the price agreement with West Ham was done. Iirc the hold up was what we would have to pay Maguire to offset his lower salary with West Ham. That's what we couldn't agree on. Correct me if I'm remembering wrongly though. I thought wages were a hold up for Maguire since we’d need to pay the differential if he was going to West Ham. Plus he still wanted to fight for his place at United  Good news is that the Saudi transfer window opened today, so might see more movement now. How you feeling about Onana leaving? He’s an exciting player.  Ye i have the same feeling. Only way we were getting him was Everton financial trouble but onana sale probably gonna deal with that  Unless he somehow suffered back injury due to great sadness and/or we pay up, he will stay Reckon Madrid will go in for him next season (If Carlo is still manager) Its a €62 m deal Literally always factored in?? Like every deal people just include the addons. Sorry, I meant €70m No, I don’t want a player that’s coming on the back end of his career in exchange for one of the best upcoming England talents  The wages of Maguire alone would completely cripple all the work we’ve done to reduce club expenditure >there's probably a reason every top club was after Yoro  There were 2 clubs actively after Yoro, Real Madrid refused to go above €25m, Man United went over double that   >and not Branthwaite  This time next year most teams will be, Man United are quite literally still wanting him  >his real value is probably closer to 40-50m when you deduct the english tax  He was valued at £70m because we DID NOT WANT TO SELL, why is this such a hard concept to understand?  You're literally paying way above Yoro's valuation which is lowered given he's in his final year of his contract that's fair fair I don't understand your snark, I just made a mistake? De Ligt would've been a less risky signing imo. Worth the money >Hopefully we get both.  We do need both. We are just one injury away from seeing Yoro and Evans partnership. Martinez came back from an injury not too long ago. And he's not had a rest all summer. Can't expect him to be all rested and fully recouped for the upcoming season. Yoro can't and shouldn't be expected to start 20 games for United. We need both.   De Ligt's wages are a big issue. His price tag or any price tag can be amortised to assist the over financial portfolio, but wages canNOT. If he signs for 5yrs and gets paid £200m pw (he's currently on £250 pw) then that's £52m in wages (a total of £100 - £120m on one player). Whilst Yoro (£42+10m) with a reported (but not confirmed) wage of £112 pw will cost united only 29m in wages over 5yrs. So a total cost to united for Yoro over 5yrs will be £81m. With a possibility of selling on for at least half if not for a profit. Whilst De Ligt will only reduce or may be his last big club move.   This to me makes sense of why we should go for Yoro first and then De Ligt if we can get some sales through. Why would you want both. He's also had 7 different injuries since he moved to Bayern, something to take into account. About £113k per week before bonuses apparently, so closer to half what De Ligt would be after. He always prefers players from the netherlands idk about prefering yoro tbh it's not. He’s gonna be earning a reported 112k a week, so I think we can say that’s better wages out of the two options in terms of priority and upside. [deleted] Yeah no of course not, defenders don’t go for that much, I was exaggerating. But we will be able to sell him for a profit if it comes to that. For Manutd that in itself is a huge win considering the last 10 years of making colossal losses on most of our signings. Even if we break even it’ll be fine. Also there is a chance that he might fall in love with the club and become a stalwart player for us. And that chance is not minimal. >Madness   Oh please, lmao. De Ligt's career has plateaued, he has not developed physically, had knee ligament issues, coming off a season where he's played fewer games than Varane, Juve happy to sell him, Bayern happy to sell him.     Not to mention there's doubts about his suitability for a more cautious role alongside Martinez who will be the aggressive CB that usually De Ligt is. Yeah we have money but the only way we get a shot at true top talent right now, with no cl, is if we get someone with the understanding that they can move on to bigger and better things if they choose to, after giving us a few good seasons. Basically do a Ronaldo. And while we have finances we really need to get maximum value from our transactions. Our previous transfers have been horrendous when it came to value and resale.   As for Deligt, there is a reason why Juve and Bayern both gave up on him. Hes not a defender who can play out from the back, he's great in tackles but not great positionally. And to play well at the top level of football you need that. I would expect a city supporter to understand that. Also I understand why you would want us to take Deligt and not Yoro 😛 Signing those superstars is one of the reasons why we've declined so much. Yoro is 18 years old and we could sell him to a bigger club for like double the fee in the future. [deleted] Yea the wages are a big thing but still man its one of the best defenders in the world at only the age of 24 and is a leader, we need that bcs our other cbs is lisandro also a young cb and maguire who isnt a good leader Frankly I think we almost certainly sign De Ligt as well.  I think we're waiting to build a bit of pressure on Bayern to drop their price as it causes us no problems to do so. We know they very much want him out so they can complete on Tah.  Especially now we seem to be getting Yoro so aren't in desperate need of a signing at CB.  I think we'll see Bayern compromise a bit, we'll sell someone and it will be done. Branthwaite is a good cb, i think he shouldve been picked for the england squad in front of players like konsa and joe gomez imo but still having de ligt and an 18 year old who had a great season and is wanted by real madrid as the other 2 choices while also being cheaper. Its a no brainer we need to give up on brainthwaite Fr he’s gone by 23, basically developing him for Real Madrid No chance they get Branthwaite after how much they’ve spent on Yoro. Doubt Everton sell him for anything less than £70m this summer No way we sign Branthwaite after what we are paying for Yoro. It's either De Ligt or someone even cheaper. The passing of Upa is better in general, but he also blunders more often. For a defender? Not really. They are usually given tons of space anyway when possession settles. As long as the partner is not easy to press, it's fine That's a good point, but I don't picture the execution being quite as static, plus Onana is brilliant on the ball IMO. So De Ligt or whoever partners Licha, will have multiple options, Dalot, Onana, Martinez, plus the midfield. Oh I completely forgot of his existence damn.. so kambwala gone i think Defence line would be Maguire, Yoro, lisandro , Evans, lindeloff and 1 more cb?   Who do you think are first choice starters? Yeah, but when I look at bayern and for how long I have been following football I cant even imagine a fall from grace for them. In my mind it feels impossible. Even clubs like barca who arent managed as well as bayern imo have been doing fine for as long as I can remember.   Thats why its so funny. You would think it requires a huge scandal and a lot of poor decisions for a team like this to fall. Not because one of their players is cursed lol. City dodged a bullet. Yeah I mean look at you guys, hopeful and excited for the season now but the same United shit is going to happen and you all will be rioting again. After last season, there's no such thing as ""too many CBs"" How much does Lindelof fetch though? 10-15m would be my guess. Likely move around 10 given his age. There's been loose links but nothing to really get excited by. Maguire rejected the move, though it was never made clear if that was because he’d have to reduce his wages (United refused to pay the difference) or because he just wanted to stay. Maguire probably did enough teams will be a bit closer to his demands this window right? Do they give big transfer fees? Would he even want to go to Saudi? I think us Utd fans are making a lot of assumptions with the potential Case sale. Branthwaite staying would soften the blow hugely and I’d already accepted he was gone this window but still quite annoying. I do think in dyches system he’s almost a luxury player however and can be replaced with cheaper alternatives but if he signs for villa can see him doing really well there. Easily world class potential 50mil € + 12 million € in addons. So 42mil£ plus addons. Yeah for winning leagues and champion leagues not just for signing, if united spend 62m that would fkking great deal. 50 + 12 add on though. And in Euros.  Isn't Everton asking for like 70m but in pound which is like 80-90 in Euros? It's not 70m euro, still wrong. This comment was powered by the ""Hey just give Yoro to us"" gang. From the analysis that I have read, Yoro might fit his system better.  While De Ligt is good at defending, even at Bayern his competition is better on the ball.  Yoro seems to be great with the ball, dribbling and mid/long passes. Doesnt really help in the Dutch team if you got VVD, Ake and De Vrij in front of you. Most overstacked position in the Dutch NT.   He is 24 with an insane amount of experience. He was 17 when he played his first final for Ajax. Look around this thread lol most Bayern fans want him to stay. Juve sold him because he wouldn't extend.      He ""plateaued"" becaue he was literally world class as a teenager. If Yoro is at the same level as what De Ligt was then he would probably plateaued too. What a stupid take. De ligt is not even close to the profiles united have wasted 100s of millions on. And no, no one is paying 100 mil for Yoro. Juve needed the $$$ and salary reduction.  Kompany wants Tah and they can’t keep everyone. To say he’s flopped is ridiculous.  Yoro is a promising 18 year old. De Ligt was an 18 year old captain, for your manager. CB’s usually take longer than others to develop, De Ligt has been starting regularly since 17.  Just saying 50 mil was amazing business I agree, you guys should’ve taken De ligt. Better player obviously.   Just being truthful, No other agenda Maybe his injury history is concerning? Wouldn't ""one of the best defenders in the world"" start for his club and/or country? Definitely not *one of the best defenders in the world*, probably was one or two seasons back Even at zenith of United’s power we lost Ronaldo to Real Madrid. Not fussed about him going to Real later on as long as it is for a decent profit. Manchester United would dream of the opportunity going back to being Real Madrids youth academy, it beats their current role in the football world Let me dream! As it stands yeah. I think it'll change across the season. Yoro will need time to settle in to the league. I think we'll see Lisandro and then a rotation of Yoro/Maguire/Evans. Lisandro probably gets subbed at 60/70 most games with Lindy coming on. If we sell Lindy then I don't know what we do. Depends how ETH plans to use Shaw across the season. We're short on LBs so I think Shaw will have to play there most games and won't factor into CB conversation.  This is all dependent on any other business we do ofc It kinda feels like the 2006–07 meme season for me Look at what happened to us after 20 years of dominance. For someone who has zero belief in superstition and jinx non-sense, the bayern fall is a culmination of poor decision making and lack of succession planning, than a player who is ""cursed"". I can't find anything more hilarious than that curse narrative. Perhaps. Perhaps some cheating justice will happen after Pep leaves and you're back to a mid-table club. That's football! You can say that for every position. Fact is we only have 25 senior slots we can register. Probably not. He's on £190k/week. Not many clubs can afford that. If he wants to move he has to take a pay cut. Don't think they need a big transfer fee as much as they need his big wages off the books. Taken aside that saudis obviously pay a lot, they are the go to player recycling area now. Whenever a player flops but initially cost a lot, its super hard to sell them to a proper team. With saudi arabia turning into an early retirement home for the greedy teams now always have thart small hope of getting bailed out by them when one of their big buys flops.  Bayern managed to sell mane to them. Its kinda wild. That’s still a €62m deal…. Are you ok? That just isn’t confirmed  Could be appearances based Yeah we are, because we’re not interested in selling at all Saying Ornstein is wrong? I’d take de Ligt over Yoro. Especially for the same price Haha I'm very happy with the squad we have, I was genuinely just speaking from a United pov I’d much rather have De Ligt. Nobody accounting for the fact De Ligt was much more better in the build-up under Ten Hag’s system and that Ten Hag made him the youngest Ajax captain ever  It’s not just a random player related to the Netherlands. It’s the player Ten Hag relied on the most in his best season as a coach That's cool, they're replacing De Ligt with Tah who is a worse player and fans certainly don't care about financial moves that make the team worse. But Bayern the club are happy to sell.   >He ""plateaued"" becaue he was literally world class as a teenager   Thank god no one told this to Messi, Mbappe etc. or else they'd be still be the same level they were as teenagers. What an absolutely hilarious take.   All those people touting him as the next van Dijk should've known, if you're world class as a teenager you're not expected to improve. So you're saying Lamine Yamal is not going to get better. He's expected to plateau in the next few years? 😂 A big name who's injury prone and has flopped at 2 clubs already, what do you mean? Sounds like a classic United signing of the past [deleted] Sorry i was a bit aggresive for no reason lol so madrid could buy him lol, sure buddy. [deleted] for world record fee, wtf are you on?? Yeah LB curse last season was bad Well...nothing happened. Youre still buying players for absurd amounts of money, you still draw in players that other clubs could never, youre still competing in the upper third of the premier league. All that happened was you lost a good manager.  You're still spending money like it's going out of fashion and you've never finished lower than 8th or whatever it is. Yes, by the standards of 1993-2013 you've fell off, but you're not really doing that badly. I am well aware curses dont exist. I just like the thought that bayern makes zero obvious mistakes but suffers anyway and as soon as Kane leaves they start winning everything again. Perhaps, perhaps nothing will happen/slap on the wrist and we'll still be winning PL titles and you're back to being a rebuilding/in shambles club only celebrating the transfer window wins. That's football! 3 GK  5 CB  4 WB/FB + 1 that can be slot into either side on an emergency.  4 CM/CDM  4 Wingers  2 CAM  2 Strikers  So yeah it's pretty close but isn't Mainoo and Garnacho are still U21 so they don't count toward the 25 limit? We almost certainly are not keeping Hannibal,Pellistri,Shoretire and maybe even Diallo. So if all of those are not registered then we only got 21 senior players on the list. And yet we dont know if Lindelof/Maguire leaves and same with Casemiro/Eriksen. Tbh he said a bit closer, not fully onboard.  If whatever sum United needs to cover to move him on is a bit lower, its a bit more likely to happen in theory. True. But we also can't sell him below a certain figure because of the amortization rules. Anything below €42m is a loss on the books and would greatly affect our budget. It isn't confirmed yet you decide to add the add-ons to the fee as if theyre paid already. Nice logic. But you’re the one claiming we’ve lost the plot spending £55m instead when it’s actually £42m base Who increased his fee in every tweet??? Sure. De Ligt has chosen 2 clubs over us in the past. Let him stew for a bit. The fans still have ptsd from all the injuries we had last seasom and de ligt had some concerns which is why sentiments are like that from many fans.  Also, don't you genuinely need another defender? I kinda want to see how De Ligt  will develop under Kompany. I'm not sure or convinced how good Vincent is as a coach, but I reckon he would be a very good teacher for De Ligt. He has flopped neither at Juve nor at Bayern. He has not flopped by any stretch. He does have some injury problems and thus has struggled to lock down a starting spot. But he is still very young and CB’s tend to get better with age. When he plays he looks quite good. Maybe slightly overrated by most in this sub but Bayern is only willing to sell sue to wages and injuries. There is a good player there and some club will benefit from it eventually. Bayern sold kroos to real madrid. How did that turn out? Okay. Doubling down. Got it, you‘ve never seen him play.  What? No.. don’t be ridiculous He's starting for us so I don't see your point. We've been a joke for the better part of 10 years through mismanagement Technically they’re middle third of the premier league Interesting use of the word 'winning', but alright. Heritage is written over decades, a lot can happen, and I wish you luck. The 5th cb is johnny evans Yoro is also under 21.  We are allowed 17 non home-grown players in a squad of 25, so that is another consideration we need to make.  It's all well and good saying we need to offload McTominay,  Maguire, AWB,  Rashford, but then we'll be in real trouble. Yoro is fine since he won't count towards the squad, same for Mainoo and Garna. So, chances are we may need to look for home-grown options for players. If we end up with three new CBs this season, i think Yoro, De ligt, and Colwill could be good. Chelsea are full of defenders, so we could probably nab Colwill for far less than Everton wants for Branthwaite. Which is what the earlier comment was saying. That we have to sell lindelof No…. I’m saying if you expect us to drop from our £70m valuation after you’ve just agreed a €62m deal for an 18 year old with 1 year left on his contract  Then you’ve lost the plot Because he’s getting more and more information obviously And Mbappe messed with us twice in the past too. So what? We also genuinely needed a Benzema replacement last season. Don Carlo makes things work. Tchouaméni will be the 3rd choice. We also have Vallejo. Carvajal can also play there in emergencies ig. Mendy too. And worst comes to worst, there's still Camavinga (only half joking) It's honestly weird that Bayern are trying to sell de Ligt when Kompany got Burnley of all teams to start playing progressive passing football. Like de Ligt is the perfect CB for that. [deleted] ah i see i just ignored the club part By your own standards yes, but youre still right there, actively doing top-team things. Youre still competing where it matters, youre not playing championship (thats the name of your 2nd div right?) football. A quiet period is not the same thing as a team imploding. It would be an interesting use for you lot considering you haven't won  a significant title in some time. Must be rough adjusting to being at the bottom of the big six. I wish you luck as well, maybe United won't be a joke once they get rid of the Glazers and their people officially. MBE Chelsea wanna keep Colwill though? have you tried starting an academy. The homegrowns dont have to be starters We're not bad off as we're not really close to the 17 non homegrown from what I can see.   Onana, Bayindir, Malacia, Martinez,Dalot, Lindelof, Casemiro, Eriksen, Bruno, Antony, Hojlund and Zirkzee are who we have (think Amad qualifies as homegrown).  That leaves us 5 slots we can fill (and that's if we sold Maguire instead of Lindelof and didn't sell Eriksen or Casemiro). Even outside of that, Bayindir and Malacia really could be not included or sold at no real loss anyway.   Selling AWB and McTominay really doesn't put us in any danger if we replace them with non homegrown players. In a good few cases, we're replacing non homegrown with non homegrown How does Yoro being U21 not make him count towards the 17 non-HG spots? Lol you ain't getting Colwill for less than 70m I don’t think anyone expects Everton to sell for a reasonable price and none of us want the club to buy at that price so I’m not sure what your point is… It's still not ideal. Carlo can't just magic his way out every time The point is he turned out great for madrid. We literally just won the FA cup. What the fuck you on about?   Unless you consider the FA cup an insignificant title? OAP U21 players don't need to be registered in the squad. Did you even read the thread from my comments? Carlo begs to differ 🤨 Madrid will win the CL because of what you just said 🥲 [deleted] Ah yes the passionate cup that allegedly saved Ten Hags job, a very significant cup... Nice math bro, 62M EUR isn’t even 55M GBP 😂😂😂 But your initial point was bayern is fine letting de ligt go. Besides, 25 million at that point is as expensive comparatively to 50m now. Ornstein said it’s €70m"

Apparently the bad relationship was a major reason why we didn't sign Cancelo on loan in January 2023. That seems like a good deal for them They would be stupid to sell him for 30-40M I like Real Madrid's transfer approach.

They have a nice mix of young talent and experienced veterans, who'll help the young guys grow and develop It reads like Jorge Mendes was murdered Lmao 40M, try 60M We should be all over this considering Varane is likely to leave, Lissandro seems quite injury prone and Evans is 36 :( For more on Leny Yoro:   https://youtu.be/-JuVDFJyYiE See people, that's why Ligue 1 is struggling to be consistent. Because of Superleague clubs like Madrid buying every talent as soon as they get through. Unbelieable. Haven't seen a worse performance than his against Madrid this seaon. Don’t forget the Brazilians too French and Brazilian infinity  ⚽️ kids Well is he no longer his agent then? Or what does it mean?   Because it seems like Mendes client is a no go for Real Madrid. Or have they turned? The alternative is to lose him on a free next year A Barca fan saying another clubs board would be stupid is great trolling. Well played but I'm not biting Must be nice It’s also extremely brave and speaks to the young players mentality that they choose to join Madrid despite those veterans being there. It would be easy for them to turn the club down on the basis of being worried about play time. Tchouameni joined when Casemiro was still at the club, Bellingham is competing against Modric, the best midfielder of the past decade. Tbf, the horseman always does these type of articles. Before we signed Tchouameni in 22, he was doing the same thing, with us not paying more than 60m for him. We bought him for 80+20...  Still a bargain at 60m he’s gonna be a world beater 60M is the PSG price as usual well take that or lose him on free. which is better? Brasileirão and every other south american league: ""first time?"" If you are to lose players, better for it to be for huge amounts.   And the main reason why ligue 1 clubs are weaker than the top 4 leagues is because they have a smaller tv deal. Being unable to keep players is a symptom of this, not the other way around.  If ligue 1 clubs are able to offer se big salaries, there will be far less reasons for young players to leave. That was Yan Couto, not Leny Yoro. There haven't been many articles about him after that game. When did you watch that game?  A bit confused are we? how are you still spewing this bullshit 🤣 We have one for them to collect Real Madrid should set up a feeder club in French Guiana He’s still his agent. It means that most of these stories about clubs having a problem with agent so-and-so are just football horoscope. Don't know the player is only opened to play for Madrid but PSG was and is willing to put a significant higher fee. The president of LOSC, Letang, gave a fuck off price in order not to reinforce a team of the same league. The alternative may also be getting outbid and never signing him. I understand Madridista's aren't exactly blessed with good reading comprehension but surely you're not this stupid...? Lol meanwhile Barca about to start a GoFundMe for their team bus gas money You need to do it progressively, not buying all at the same time. Casemiro said he decided to leave Madrid right after the 2022 UCL final, in May. That means that when Tchouameni signed in June, Madrid probably already knew that he would nost probably leave. It wouldn't be surprising that Tchouameni also got the message from them.   Modric was never any competition for Bellingham. You don't sign a player for 100M+ to not be a guaranteed starter. Plus it was getting obvious that at 38 years old Modric didn't have the legs to be the offensive, box to box midfielder he used to be and was transitioning into a more ""build up/quaterback"" midfielder.   Your point is valid with youngsters like Vini, Rodrygo, Camavinga or Fede. But I think you chose the worst two examples to prove it lol. Yeah I'm sure if Real Madrid came and bid £40mill and a big contract for one of Carlisle's players they'd  turn it down because they're not brave enough  Bellingham turned down all the massive clubs to instead go to Dortmund because he isn't brave. Weak mentality up until he joined Madrid Yes it is a sign of immense courage to say yes when the most successful football club in history wants to sign you. I would never have the guts and I hate that I know that about myself. Thistbh. You'll see stories where it's ""club refuses to go about X price"" and we certainly won't pay 100m for this lad, IMO. But I can easily see us pay 50m to 60m in order to make things more palatable for Lille. We like to maintain good relationships with the clubs we do business with. He still has a contract for a year. And Madrid aren't the only club looking at him.  We aren't at the whim or Real Madrid No it's not the first time, it's that way since Bosman (1995). I'm just explaining why Ligue 1 team are struggling to be top 6 teams. PSG is the only team but even them are struggling to keep Mbappé. Look how people are talking when they manage to keep Mbappé, them they will complain that Madrid or the likes are getting all the talented players.   They sound dumb to me. Why do they have a weaker TV deal? Because their good players are leaving too soon or at all. You need good player to negotiate big deals. Too old Who? Ahaa But i think its legit the problems between Mendes and Real Madrid, but i dont know ofcourse. It looks like Lille does not want to sell to PSG, but Real Madrid does not want to sign a Mendes client.   So is he no longer a Mendes client? Just as you’re not blessed with good grammar skills. Madridistas*  And stop generalising just to take down one guy. Well, it depends on where he wants to go it. With one year left, he holds all the power. If he really wants madrid, then you'll be forced to sell. But if the player only wants Real Madrid, your leverage goes away no?   I hope he signs for Real Madrid, but i hope the club gets what he is worth. Perez is often willing to pay up to keep good relationship with other clubs. What's stopping PSG from being a club like Bayern? They play in a lesser league, like PSG. Madrid is not the problem here lol Pre Bosman this wasn’t an issue. If losing players is an issue for France and not the top 4 it’s because there has historically been less interest which leads to less money. Once you are distanced, it’s harder to catch up.   I agree losing players doesn’t help, but in this case Lille gets 40m€ + for him which is more than enough to maintain their squad strength. The issue is when players leave on end of contracts or before turning professional for free. The young one They probably mean the rapist. He still is a Mendes client, as is like half of PSG’s team. I also doubt Lille would care if he goes to PSG, all they want is a big pay check. But does he only want RM? I wonder? Lille and other L1 clubs keep asking 30% more when an offer comes from PSG. Hazard was the most notable one but there's plenty of those examples Madrid is the problem with the Mbappé saga. You cannot build team chemistry and a great squad if you constantly sell players. That's the point i am making! did I stutter? Too old How good is he? If you dont mind me asking? I have no idea, and i see how i maybe made it sound like that.   What do you think? If PSG was a well-run club, balanced squad you name it, and PSG was successful in continental Europe then maybe Mbappe would've stayed. Don't blame Madrid for PSG's failures. That’s just the reality of all football clubs bar English ones and a few very rich ones. It’s not like french clubs are the only victims of this. Aight Meryn Trant, get your pedo ass out of here There's no reason to assume it Nah, PSG has a balanced squad now that Messi and Ramos left. The biggest issue is Nasser. When the choice is between PSG and RM, we can safely assume whom he will choose. No we literally can't...   He's French, why wouldn't he follow the path of Kimpembe? He will follow the path of Varane. Okay, if you say so Yeah no one knows lol. Mbappe chose PSG over Real Madrid multiple times."

Biggest club in world football, I'm afraid. Must be boring for RM fans being that rich spoiled kid that gets all the toys. I'd say 40 million is too much, because the add-ons will be something very easy to get done (like 10 millions if he plays 5 matches) As long as it’s not saliba 👌 There is no need to be afraid. Pretty much, they have such influence that they strong arm clubs into taking their fees or the player waits it out and leaves on a free The absolute top dogs, they stand on their own. Before Bartonomics you used to have players take pay cuts to join Barca too, look how distant they are from that level now compared to Madrid. Gerrad and Totti said no No need to state the obvious Real and Bayern have the biggest pull in the world and it’s not even close What do you mean? Its a great time. Why would it be boring? Not really. Its fun It wasn't always like this id rather retain Nacho In time, you will know what it's like to lose [a player to Madrid]. To feel so desperately that you're right. Yet to fail all the same. Dread it. Run from it. ~~Destiny~~ Perez still arrives. There is if you are up by only 1 goal against them by the 85th minute in an UCL night 😭 Tbh, it took historic levels of fucking up by the board to degrade Barca's pull Bro slipped in Bayern like we wouldn't notice Seeing the way every Tom, Dick and Harry rejected our approach for manager position this summer, I would begin doubting our pull [deleted] Drenthe era>>>>>>> I would say for the majority of your fanbase it was.  RM always had fans, but naturally the big wave came after Cristiano joined the club. To be fair there's probably only a handful of PL players RM would want or need.   Only Saliba or Saka if Rodrygo ever left from Arsenal. Not really sure who else in the PL would interest them. Even 2 goals up tbh I mean how is it wrong? They also just got the best striker in the world last year Call me whatever you want lol, dont give a shit. Faubert ON LOAN Only 2 players from Arsenal is what RM could possibly want from PL. And they wonder why people hate Arsenal fans Why would Real Madrid want any more player on the left? Because Tottenham wouldn't sell inside the PL. Bayern is not on Madrid level, in terms of pure pull (if you ignore finances) they're also not on Barca's level. Probably on the same level as the top PL clubs where they have more pull for certain players and less for other ones. After his first choice to Man City fell through lol. Yeah because Spurs refused to sell him to Man City 2 years ago, and priced us out last year. You'll give a shit once things go haywire, ask Barca fans. Might jump into city's massive oil pool party. Saka plays on the right. So when Real Madrid start losing i will care about what you call me? Play him at left back, I heard that's a good idea Plastic cuz you'll be city fan then. Have not changed yet, been a fan for 30 years now so. But atleast you get to act hard on the internet."

Mental that he's still only 24. This guy is a prime waffler when it comes to Manchester United. He knows nothing. Pletti suffering from withdrawal for not linking us to De Ligt again.   Hopefully he gets the help he needs ASAP. I wish there was a site that tracked journalists by the transfer stories they claim to have news on so we could really see who the bullshit merchants are as this dude seems to be one of them.  If I wa smart enough to create such a thing I would, unfirtunately I am dumb  It must in theory be possible to have a bot track each football journalists profiles and their tweets using keywords to catergorize by context of the tweet and then score the tweet on a weighted scale of accuracy? If this made any sense, I don't know what the technical terms are for what I mean lol Same guy who had absolutely no clue about Olise and Ito, he doesn't know shit about Bayern and I doubt it's different when it comes to ManU. Seems like he's been around forever, I didn't realise he was only 24. Nooo. I thought he’d stay at bayern for life 50 only? They could get much more for him There's absolutely no way INEOS come in and take on his mental wages in their first window when they're so obviously trying to fix the mistakes of the past like the wage structure. It's an easy link. He knows nothing but keeps repeating the same shit every day.  Dutch player who played for United's manager at his old club and United was interested in him when he went to Juve. That's an easy link. Notice how he was like 3 days late on Olise but keeps doubling down on Tah & De Ligt.   The player has to agree to a transfer as much as the club and I don't think taking a pay cut to play in Europa League would be enticing for him. Honestly I think this would actually be a good signing for Ten Hag compared to pretty much any he’s done for Man Utd.  But the wages and such seems against the standard the new owners want to set. Then again they will have to bend a little to attract top talent as most other clubs do Crazy to think of his trajectory so far, during that Ajax champions league run he looked like a top contender for top CB in the future.  He still got time to improve but wild that he is about to join a 3rd team different team since then thank you mister Kim with your infinite knowledge He was 17 when he played for us in the EL final against United. He's not really leaving those teams because he's bad. Leaving Juventus was on his own volition and Bayern signed him on a relatively ridiculous wage and kept stacking their squad with prime CB real estate. He still is. He’s just 24. He did well at Juve he was just to expensive for them. And now at Bayern he’s done great as well. Just that Bayern seek to cut their finances. So he also became to expensive. If he goes to a team that does not care about his salary and bonuses he’d probably never be sold again unless he wants to leave. He is very good though and most Bayern fans don't want him to leave. Seems to be some sort of wage balancing move by them. For 50M it should be an instant buy for any rich club looking for a CB and no issues with wages.  edit: Just realized that United value him at 50M. Bayern might not agree. I wouldn't say about to, this fella hasn't got a clue when it comes to United I believe he prefers to be called ""Supreme Leader"" I never meant to imply he is leaving because he is bad. Im just bewildered because finding a CB that good, in such a young age is a gold mine for any team. I expected him to make the big move and stay with a team for years and reach his potential.  With 20/20 hindsight, choosingJuventus mighta been a mistake, but Bayern are the ones screwing up here by letting go of a solid defender. Juventus was the wrong move in hindsight with their collapse in mind.   The problem De Ligt has is that he's on a extraordinary wage for a centreback. This was true for Juventus and for Bayern. He is a top 25 centreback in the world, but he's not going to win you titles on his own like Van Dijk. So when you need space in your wage structure it is really alluring to sell your relatively young star CB that's wanted by any topclub needing someone for that position.  De Ligt's curse is that he's really good, just barely not good enough. If he was worse, he'd probably stay, if he was better, they'd never want to sell him. Oh we know lol. I don't understand why we are doing this.  He's so good. And Kim too. But they play a few bad games and suddenly it's lights out. But upamecano gets one million chances to get another red or give away a penalty.  Make it make sense. What are you talking about? Upamecano gets a lot of stick for his mistakes by Bayern fans. In fact, he is the only one out of these 3 where they don't delude themselves that he is world class despite only one season at that level at 27 years old (Kim) or because of his potential from 5 years ago even though no coach really rates him that much (De Ligt)."

After moving forward on a contractual agreement in recent days, as revealed by Fabrizio Romano, Manuel Ugarte could join the Red Devils, the Uruguayan player has indeed agreed with the Manchester club. However, the positions of the two clubs are not yet aligned.

The PSG opened the door to a start at the beginning of the summer when the English first knocked on the door. Paris does not, however, want to lose money on an item bought at Sporting Portugal last season. The management even asked 70 million euros for the transfer of Uruguayan international. A sum that the Mancunians would not be willing to invest in the immediate future. English leaders would reflect on a different proposition structure, including a loan with a purchase option.

He's not noticeably better than when he joined, and absolutely not worth 70m. Move on to the next target no doubt.  No way united is paying that, they still need to sell to get him in the first place ""English team would reflect on a different proposition structure""  How do I tell someone to fuck off in a work email?  Absolute poetry Well like Branthwaite we will move on.  Thanks PSG. Bye. Ridiculous price, if that's it time to move on. PSG supposedly paying that for Neves so utd should have a punt at him instead Much rather we signed Hjulmand or Youssef Fofana. Not a fan of Ugarte, PSG certainly overpaid and are rightfully trying to get rid. 70 lmao. That's more than Yoro €70m?! Lol they want United to pay for Neves, they should turn their attention towards Neves if that's how PSG are going on. That price feels at least 20M more then we would want to pay and only if we can move some midfielders (Case, Scott and Christian) on.  Though I do like the idea of loan to buy and could see us paying a little more if we could structure it like that.  Edit: though the more I think about it, I’m not sold on his potential acquisition. His limited passing ability make him a potential liability and that’s the primary reason PSG are moving him on.  The argument could be made that if United have better ball playing defenders, they can alternate with him in the build up phase but I would prefer a more deep lying midfielder who can make line breaking passes. Go get neves show them they fucked around  They should sign Neves instead for the lolz I doubt we would be willing to pay a cent more than 50, time to look at other options I guess. United should go for Neves now instead. Just as a fuck you to PSG Psg is still living in that era where any random team can bend united and ask whatever they want and united will oblige as well. Bye They should sign Neves instead for the lolz How bout we put 70m bid on Neves too. Lol 🤣 United could just move on. I think L’E is saying some BS and everyone in the comments are getting triggered by it. It’s a Mendes transfer, surely he will make it feasible for both parties. It benefits psg and Man U both PSG Desperate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 70m they on crack or what? Tchouameni went for 100 and he’s 3 times the player lmfao Let's get Neves instead Thanks but no thanks PSG. What are good alternatives from seria A, Ligue 1 and the Portuguese league? He’s gonna become the new Uruguayan Kante, just watch Would be peak if we hijack the João Neves transfer from them😂 Isnt neves going to go for 70m? Lets just go for him Doubt it is a “this or nothing” price  It’ll go down to 50-55m if I had to guess and we’d be very happy with that [deleted] Wasn’t he valued at 50m before? Why the hell did psg hike the price up all of a sudden? PSG just doing their usual. Outpricing people to keep players that don’t want to be there.  Mbappe would have gone Real last year but they are cowboys Ugarte is a 30m midfielder at most. Anytime I've watched him he is genuinely pretty terrible. The disaster classes in the Champions League last year I'll never forget. United have been really good business wise this window. Would hate to see them overpay for this chump. This is stupid, if we pay this amount. Surprised that we didn't go for Le Fée. He went much cheaper than Ugarte and had that Carrick/De Jong metronome vibe about him. £25M    Pay in 3 years installments. Take it or bye. PSG think Murtough's still doing the deals, clearly. I really hope Benfica won’t sell Neves to PSG, not even for the release clause. Ugarte for €70 mln after anderwhelming season and Neves for the same price? These guys are joking, right? 4iy6555p.7466 Going from Ugarte to Neves for the same price would be the best move ever Lol. Maybe 40M euros. Anything more and it'd be a fast no thank you What has Psg done to my boy Would rather try to beat Villa to Onana for that money. He’s known in the Prem and would add some height to the mix. Have we been linked with any other midfielders?  Neves seems like a completely different player. Yeah Sure, PissG. Maybe PSG thought Ed Woodward is still at United.  If they think Ugarte is $70m, why not try asking Benfica for a straight swap for Neves. See how that goes. This guy is worh 30m at best PSG paid 60M euro one year ago and both he doesn’t technically fit anymore and has done little to add to that value. So this needs to settle around 45-50M max It will me fun if United instead start talks with Joao Neves to put pressure on PSG PSG: “He was a disappointment and we regret signing him.”  Also PSG: “Give us 70 mil or else.” 70M for Ugarte  LMAO Well, given that they overpaid for Ugarte in the first place and only need about 48m Euros to break even, no one is paying 70m Euros. This is a stinker for United, bad player with huge wages and is not a DM. They are fucked Aight perfect keep him. We will take Neves so they'll pay the transfer of Neves for them lol, Mendes in action No chance we do now with the new structure in charge thank fk lol. Move on to the next target no doubt unless PSG come back down to reality with their price  instead of paying psg that money you lot should hijack joao neves deal It’s what we are asking tho, but we would agree to 55+5 imo. He is a very good player, he was stellar when he started the season but drop off gradually. Then Luis Enrique put Vitinha as a 6 and he slowly stopped playing. He has strong qualities defensively and he is great with his NT too. So imo considering the market it’s not crazy that he's leaving for this price I hope you pay double for offloading Greenwood on us lol Felt like we were only interested because we could get him at a decent price as he is no longer wanted there, if PSG want €70 the time to move on. from copa America. although I agree. His time in psg isn’t great from what I’ve seen. They want to fund Neves transfer. The fact it's United asking? That's not how it works, it's like the Gravenberch to Liverpool deal, he spent one season at Bayern mostly on the bench, but Bayern sold him for almost double the amount they bought him for. If a player has a market and a long contract he'll be expensive. The market is based purely on projection these days. It's not necessarily about what a player has done to justify a certain value, it's about whether the clubs think he *could* justify that value in the future. We didn’t ask 56m for Di Maria, did we? We sold him to PSG after 12 months at a huge loss. Now it’s time to return the favour. To be fair he had a release clause. I could see a move totalling that as possible but it would be a loan of say 20m (which might be 10 up front and 10 based on game time or CL qualification) and then say an option to pay 50m more to keep him, although maybe something similar and it's 60m total.  It would be a bad look to pay it straight up, more so if PSG get Neves for that much. For that price you can even go back to your first target, Joao Neves. If the rumored 70 mil price is to be believed that is, which sounds sus at best tbh. You wont find a better suited DM for that price. But, ofc negotiation will happen and probably get him for 55/60M + bonus, and then in 2/3 years time you'll saying it was a bargain, like Bruno Fernandes. Ugarte is one of the best if not the best DM in the world purely from a defensive perspective, which is exactly what Man Utd needs. The guy benched Palhinha on Sporting... [deleted] Now Neves Didn't Whitwell report yesterday that you're still interested in Branthwaite? > PSG supposedly paying that for Neves so utd should have a punt at him instead  That's not the same profile. Ugarte is a DM, neves is an interior and more creative There's no garantee you get the same neves quote as us, we have good relationship with benfica. lol to similar to Mainoo Fofana close to signing for Milan i think alltough the bid isnt very high Man U could pay more ofc also in salaries Hjulmand would be interesting for Man U deff cheaper then Ugarte and big improvement over Casemiro (alltough any cdm thats decent and can run is prob allready beter). Unless he's getting that Arsenal tattoo removed I don't think we'd ever consider him. Watch Monaco demand 50 m for fofana when Man U comes. For Milan it’s 30m Hjulmand isn't better than Ugarte. Who had only a year of contract not 4. Yoro was 62+8,wasnt he? So same price ofc Utd wont pay 70 directly it will be 60+10 He is not that bad with the ball tbh. He can make very good passes when he has time and space ahead of him. It’s just that PSG has 70% possession in most Ligue 1 games so Luis Enrique prefers Ruiz and Vitinha over him for that. I think Ugarte is more suited for transition football and could be good in PL. He wins duels and he has a great sense of anticipation I’d argue Ugarte’s midfield positioning is probably more critical to avoid giving up easy counterattacks/shots per game.  Line breaking passes while nice can be fulfilled by players in other areas of the pitch. Tchou went for 80mil Ugarte deff not worth 70mil lol Tchouameni is 80m euros €50m max. Even if he's really good they want to get rid of him and he wants to leave as well apparently. If we don't pay I don't think anyone else is paying for him. So let them keep a bench player instead of taking €50m. Lol your comment doesn’t make sense, it’s the other way around, PSG wanted Mbappé to leave last summer but he chose to join Real Madrid as a free agent. Concerning Ugarte it’s just negotiation games, Luis Enrique doesn’t mind if he is leaving and the player is not happy with his playtime. They will settle to an agreement if United interest is real. And we’ll play the release clause. No one’s taking Neves off of us lol Didn’t the new structure just pay what the fee wanted for yoro ? Basically same as before, Lille knew they can overcharge Man U You've just paid 62+8 million for an 18 year old I wish, but I don't think we have the funds for that even if Casemiro goes to Saudi. Even 55+5 is what you paid a year ago which is a bit too high for a guy who's clearly out of favour and doesn't fit the style of Enrique Ah yes blame United for forcing Olympique to buy Greenwood. lol I mean tbf 70 euros is an absolute steal though He doesn't suit Enrique's tactics, that's all. PSG just try to exchange him for Neves United should just go after Neves if this how PSG want to play. Yeh but here PSG are actively trying to shift him and want the funds for Neves. It’s surely not in their best interest to price us out of the deal. Still think Grav was a stupid transfer for us as we already bought MacA and Szobo for the 2 8’s and then had Jones and Elliot there to cover. Overpaid in both transfer fees and wages. Don’t know why Klopp rated him so much. > it's about whether the clubs think he *could* justify that value in the future.   That depends on the players recent performance, which as most people have been saying has been not up to what was expected or needed at PSG. Even then, I think there's reservations about his size considering we already have a relatively small squad in terms of height. Zirzkee and Yoro help that, but if we sell McTominay that may put us back to where we were. Neves is not the same profile of player though. Signing Neves when you have Mainoo locked in for that midfield spot makes little sense. When the imposter is sus! If it's 55/60m + bonus that's still too much. I can't see it going beyond 50/55m total tbh I don't know if we can even afford that price. Even if we sell players like AWB, Maguire, Casemiro, Sancho, etc, we would also have to get some replacements for the sold players. We would at least need a CB and a FB alongside Ugarte if those sales happen, without saying anything about the attack. We have already spent about a 100 million on Zirkzee and Yoro, the new purchases would be an addition 120 million on top. We are not making enough money from sales to cover that. It's almost as if a completely new structure has been appointed since then. Yes but now we have an entirely new team of people dealing with transfers, no way INEOS or anyone they hired sanctions stuff like that anymore. Maybe that's one of the reasons we can't afford this? And the people who let it happen we're shown the door. N-o! Interested but unless Everton are forced to lower their demands because of factors at the club, it's not going to happen. What’s an interior? Never heard that term in relation to a position before Ya ugarte is more defensive minded than Neves and Neves way better passer of the ball but Neves is a aggressive presser and tackler too. PSG want him to replace ugarte so they see him playing a deep midfield role, no reason why utd shouldn't too. I don't think utd have that money to now spend on a midfielder at all but if we gonna be forking that much out for ugarte surely we try for a  younger and more rounded player “Good relationship” i.e. paying under the table He's a Jorge Mendes client. We've had a relationship with Mendes years before you guys entered the big boys table with Qatar coming in. Obviously you've not watched him play much if you think his too similar to Mainoo. Don't think the management want or will miss Fofana if United  trying to snatch our target again especially since the Ultras already have a pretty shaky relationship with the new owner and we pretty much refusing to pay anyone what they worth since they took the club Milan finally making moves, Fofana is literally the kind of player we overlook today then drop 80 million on him in 3 years, lol.   Apparently Ugarte is a signing being pushed for by ""Dominic Jordan"" and the new data science department. They've apparently christened him as ""their guy"". With how much has been recently invested into this new department, it's more so a show of trust/testing the waters to go after their first major recommendation. There's some politics at play here because most people know Ugarte is not ""it"". I said this in our sub and got slated lol Interesting, do you have any thoughts on Porto's Alan Varela? It says 70 right there. Not 60+10. Even that would be a lot It was 80m rising to 100m. Not wrong enough to merit a correction. I assume the Ugarte 70m will be inclusive of add-ons too. So it's 70 max vs 100 max. Fuck. You guys did well. Different situation. We paid that fee to make Lille put pressure on him to go to us.   There is nothing of those incidental factors with Ugarte I mean if he flops if it's an overpay. If he progresses as he has, touted as a generational CB, it'll be cheap in comparison. Ugarte is not the same in terms of talent, nor is there the same amount of buyers (Madrid, Liverpool etc). Completely different in terms of a purchasing aspect. PSG clearly want to get rid of Ugarte as he doesn't suit their squad, so the fee is too inflated to be reasonable. Reports in France actually say that Lille was gobsmacked by how high of a price United offered… haha 52+8*. There's a big difference between buying the highest rated young CB in the world, to a midfielder that's stagnated in the last season and was barely in the starting 11 by seasons end that's clearly not in the clubs plans moving forward. [deleted] I understand perfectly. But tbf you know what you get with Ugarte. His qualities don’t fit Luis Enrique's system, but he still showed his qualities at PSG and with the NT. He wins duels, he has a great sense of anticipation, he can protect his defence. You don’t have on the market a lot of young players with this profile and more importantly with guarantee of this level of quality. Let me go through the stages of grief. I'm between anger and denial. Braindead comment to a obvious joke Not when they only paid 60m for him last year and now actively want to get rid of him after an underwhelming season to make room for Neves  Edit: I'm an idiot... Still, think there's wiggle room to negotiate down to 50 euros and a couple of free Freddos. Found the PSG spy Neves isn't the answer to our CDM woes though  He would essentially compete with mainoo. Good point, but I think since they are saying they want 70, he'll get sold for a package of around 60m, probably means manchester will pay around 50m in fixed amount, which isn't that unreasonable. I think it will all get done eventually. Seems more like a Mendes scheme at this point. United overpay for Yoro and in turn get Ugarte for a reasonable fee. PSG in turn gets Neves for a reasonable fee. He gets big agent fees for three players and everyone is happy   The only party that loses is Benfica In hindsight it seems stupid sure, but he was very highly rated at Ajax, people said Bayern were so luck to get him for a relatively low price, I think Klopp probably thought could get him back on track but it seems it hasn't worked out It doesn't necessarily depend on recent performances when it comes to younger players. The market has shown this repeatedly.  More importantly, clubs have their own internal evaluations of specific players that are often far removed from the wider fan sentiment. Just because we might have a negative view of a player's time at a club, doesn't necessarily mean the market feels the same way. I read and watched some scouting reports of Neves when Ornstein linked us linked to him, and to my surprise everyone says he's quite dominant at winning headers as well holding himself under pressure and contact. He's a rare tough little man with a lot of technique.   This is from my most trusted scout, Billy Carpenter:  > He is Kanté and Gavi rolled into one, and might give Conor Gallagher a run for his money for the amount of psychotic energy he brings to the pitch; he’s short but has won every open-play aerial duel I’ve ever seen him contest. He’s got a lot more in his bag, including absolutely slick ball control, and Benfica will rightfully ask for an astronomical bounty. I'm not really well versed with Mainoo's profile, only watched him against us and during Euros. Are you saying he's similar to Joao? Neves's best high percentile attributes are his defensive contributions (tackles, interceptions, ground and aerial duels) and being really really press resistant. Ie. whatever you'd want from a modern tenacious but technically sound 6 bar passing range. From what I've seen Mainoo is more of an offensive midfielder. It is not, he'll be worth that and more considering is age. But no point in trying to convice people who barely seen him play, fair enough. [deleted] It's funny because I meant the one formerly at Wolves, but since you reminded me... The guy was an interior midfielder. He killed sixteen Czechoslovakians. It's an inverted trequartista. Assuming it’s a fifa term that people use to sound like they know their shit. It’s the Spanish term for a central midfielder, largely. Interior midfielders are central midfielders. In a 4-3-3 u have two interiors midfielders and one pivot. U have two pivots in a 4-2-3-1 therefore it’s called a double pivot. We did not really play ugarte once our midfield was set so we are not getting neves to replace ugarte. I mean they really hold different fonctions as players, just happens to be that we do not need ugarte in enriques system. A more rounded player often isn't what clubs want in that position, especially when you have someone like Mainoo to fit in. Neves and Mainoo as a 2 in a 4-2-3-1 offers no where near enough positional discipline. Both are willing pressers, but that midfield would make United even easier to cut through than they were last season and would not do anything to even partially solve the 20 shots a game issue.  I'd also argue PSG are hardly the shining light of a team's business making a tonne of sense and playing that way in a 4-3-3 is different than playing that way in a 4-2-3-1 with Bruno. If you think a double pivot of Mainoo and Neves would work for ETH in the prem then you are nuts. This tracks with Ornstein mentioning there's some internal dispute at United about whether Ugarte is the right player Alan Varela isn't better than Hjulmand. Understandable. €70m will never be cheap. It will be expensive but fair in hindsight 62+8 in € But how is he the highest rated 18 yr old in the world? No one has a clue lol lmao I think right now Manchester United don't want to pay the 70 million since there is no serious competition to signing him from another club.   Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong) I believe united knows that PSG must sell to fund their Joao Neves move and potentially continue for Osimhen. There is no reason to panic drop 70 million when PSG will need the cash to fund future signings. As long as we wait, PSG might get more desperate as they risk their transfer targets being delayed. Yes, but the thing is - market value is a function of how your club values him. Your club clearly doesn't value him and want to offload. I would be shocked if we spend 45 + 5 as well given PSG needs him gone for Neves. I don’t know if you can ever get to acceptance on this one Please treat him like shit for us. Sorry, your club effectively bought our trash from us. I wish he didn't get any offers from Europe. Freddos, in this economy? >and a couple of free Freddos.  Fuck me we're not made of money A couple of Freddos is the world transfer record mate I think he was making a joke of paying 70 euros. Not 70 million. Couldn't Mainoo and Neves run a double pivot though?   They both seem defensively solid for number 8s. Which is a good thing Kobbie is 19 we can't risk running him to the ground or putting most of the creative responsibility on him Ugarte is not a CDM either though Ugarte is a really limited player and only suits certain systems. I personally wouldn't pay a penny over 50m, including add ons Idk it seemed stupid at the time to me. We had so much cover for that position and the wages are just not worth it. The transfer fee is honestly whatever but that deal didn't make a lot of sense imo. I was gutted Liverpool got him, he was very high rated before moving to Bayern. I haven't seen a lot of him to rate his current market value but Liverpool under Klopp's tenure rarely miss so I bet he could be really hit the ground running next season This is true, I guess it has been the same with Martinez and actually being really dominant in aerial contests. If they were both going for 70m, I would absolutely take Neves in a heartbeat, especially with his great technical skills. I think PSG already have an agreed deal, but maybe INEOS can pull some more magic to change his mind haha Mainoo can be compared to a Frenkie De Jong type player, or a Pogba without the progressive passing part (for now?).  Basically, press resistant, great dribbler, ball carrier, short passes mostly rn, decent defensivly (more covering man, than interceptions and tackles). They're different players, but neither is really the profile you'd want from a defensive midfielder. Both are players that would be great next to a prime Casemiro rather than players that would be expected to take up his role. I think you'd be really wasting Neves' ability by asking him to do that and it wouldn't get the best out of him either.  Neves is great at those things, but it's more of in the way that someone like Jordan Henderson was great at those things. Both great pressers and terriers and well rounded midfielders who could do a job there, but you'd rather have Fabinho (as was the case for Liverpool) or Florentino Luis (as is the case for Benfica now) as the main defensive midfielder. No No, they started this season Which rock do you live under No, new (partial) owner came in February and the new sporting director literally just started work 2 weeks ago having spent the last 4 months on gardening leave (no work but still being paid by Newcastle) so he probably had everything set up to execute when he was given clearance to start his new job. Clueless Vivell, Berrarda and Ashworth all started in the last month.  Wilcox a few months ago.  So no, none of those signings were under the new structure. His house looked like shit. But he never had the makings of a varsity CDM though. No it fucking isn't, it's a false-inverted defensive libero. It's called mezzala or box to box or simply CM It's gonna be a regista, cause Fabian or Vitinha talent will be wasted as regista Well the thing is, it's not 70M. I don't know if you can't read or are just disingenuous.  It's 62M euros which is about 52M GBP which is a good price to pay for a said generational talent at the age of 18 for a 5 year contract with a 12 month option (overall 6). Well since the buying club is English, better off just keeping it with £ Because that's what football departments and scouts do for a living? Find the most talented players, like any other talent in the world. Reddit, including myself, have no clue, but generally the people in those departments do lol Well Real Madrid do rated him that clearly... I’d expect a €40 mill + 10 offer to go in. Maybe rising by 5 mill. No more than that When he starts scoring goals, many will accept it I hear it would take the total fee to *at least* €50.60  To quote Truss, ""that. is. a. disgrace."" hence why I'm an idiot for not spotting that before leaping in Is anyone a CDM apparently no one is anymore. Tbh I always thought it was a red flag that:  A) he was pushing to leave Bayern within the space of a year, he will likely do the same with us at some point  B) Bayern were willing to let him go, they aren't a selling club & wouldn't let him waltz off for £40m if they rated him as a top talent regardless of him pushing. I doubt that'll happen. Doesn't seem to have the mindset of true pros. Elliott and Jones are more likely to keep improving than Gravenberch imo. [deleted] one football boot cocksucker Mezzala is the same as interior. Box-to-box is a role instead of a position, as you can perform it as part of a double pivot or as an interior/mezzala. CM is a much less specific term. You're playing too much FM mate. Interior is a perfectly normal term originating from Spanish. Vitinha has been great as a regista last season. But yeah he can more useful higher on the pitch Vitinha will stay where he is is my guess, but then again I don't understand why we want Neves. Vitinha and him seem to accomplish the same role with the same general weakness of being smaller physically. Then again I haven't seen that much of Neves so maybe I am mistaken. Vitinha revived his career at PSG playing that Fabian is trash as a regista and is not suited for the role, he's more of a run in late into the box type midfielder for us and relieve pressure in possession, while Vitinha had his best spell at PSG as a regista. Its €62m rising to €70m with add ons. Maybe you can’t read? Not sure why you’re attacking me. If he does well, it will probably rise to €70m which is the case we’re discussing.  It’s objectively expensive but paying for quality is fine (in this case, you’re still gambling on potential). Don’t get why everyone is obsessed with calling something a steal or a good deal. If he works out, it was still an expensive gamble. Whether he makes it or not doesn’t change the nature of the initial purchase. The article in this post is in € and the selling club uses €. The selling club is European.  There's no right currency Yeah but we don’t have a global report saying “this guys the #1 teenage CB” lol Not at the valuation United paid for him RTed him enough for 25 mil or free in a year… don’t seem too bothered.   Plus Lille forced this guy to join united lol. Just like with Zirkzee who wanted Milan but united were the ones who’d pay the huge agent fee Don't worry, at least you're handsome. At this point everyone is ""more of an 8"" I think the online tacticos refer to them as ‘interior midfield destroyers’ these days. Rodri is, Tchouameni is, Rice has played as one this season, Zubimendi is, Casemiro.  CDM refers to someone positionally disciplined and stays behind and protects the defense while Ugarte type players cover the whole pitch and try to win the ball higher up. The likes of Ugarte, Kante, Valverde, Gavi, Merino are not CDMs. They are all box to box players. What are we supposed to do then?   We are fans of the club, the club has made sensible appointments, and we are happy about that. We are hopeful that this will result in an improvement. What is clueless about that?? It's literally what being a fan is all about.   Time will tell if the new structure works, but we're allowed to be positive about it after the shitshow of the last 10 years. Dude you're clearly less well informed than 99% of people in this thread so your opinion isn't worth much Also signed Yoro literally yesterday 🤦🤦 Who let this donkey out of the cage today? Yeah cause FM creating their own term that never exist in real football Neves is better at defending, remember that regista role require that a lot and that's why Vitinha playing there will only waste extra energy and focus from him that can be used going forward.   I don't say Vitinha bad at defending, it just maybe they see something from Neves that was they expected to get from Ugarte last season, but he just not that good on the ball. But you always quote the base price which is 62M otherwise every transfer is bloated up.  We can discuss whether it will be successful or not but saying its 70M is factually incorrect. It's 62M plus addons which is how people talk because 62M is what we will pay for him at the least and the rest is based on what happens over the next 5+1 years. And even so, they are completely different types of deals So let's not bother with semantics. Anyone with half a football brain knows these are two completely different players and deals. Because they don't need him right away and they believe they have upper hand as he like them and seems like he would choose them no matter what. I guess based on your opinion, every Man UTD transaction is a mistake. lets just call them ""the gattuso"" Rice hasn't played as one this season, he's been more box to box for arsenal Casemiro isn't a 6 by any means these days, his lack of discipline positionally especially as he slows down is crazy. Yeah, try saying ""he's primarily a half-back, he's not a Segundo Volante"" and people will be telling you to get a life and touch grass mate. That’s like talking about an acquisition and ignoring earn-outs. Who do you think pays for them? The tooth fairy?   €62m is if he never makes an appearance for MU up to 70 mil is still mad for an 18 year old who's proven himself for just one season.  It is a very ""Man U"" transfer  Edit: Yes the deal is different but the Yoro-deal still doesn't quite radiate financial responsibility > So let's not bother with semantics.  You were literally the person that started with the semantics. Even when it became clear that he was going to United they could have stepped in, but they chose not to. Rice played more than half his games as a CDM. He was only moved to the box-to-box role because Havertz underwhelmed there, and we also had Jorginho and Partey to play as CDMs. I am going to avoid talking to a wall. And yet maybe it ends up being a bargain in 5 years time? Plus if he wants to go he will have a big resale value. It's far from being a Manchester united deal of old, anyone with half a brain can see that. It's rare we manage to get such a highly rated youngster like this, Haaland and Bellingham are the last two we missed out on and those deals wouldve been bargains by now. >It is a very ""Man U"" transfer  No, a very Man U transfer is paying 70 mil for a 31 year old. United have supposedly lost out on some big players in the not too distant past because they dithered. The likes of Haaland, Varane and Bellingham, supposedly. This time, they went full steam ahead. If Yoro turns out to be a success, nobody will care about the transfer fee. ""Because they don't need him right away"" I believe I put it very clearly. Maybe he does, but maybe any player anyone buys will be a bargain in 5 years.  Bellingham and Haaland are not comparable at all - they were already among the best in the world when they went to Madrid/City.  PS: And they also went for comparable prices to Yoro, while being miles ahead You can't just ignore the part that came immediately after where you said that they thought he would choose them no matter what. Once it became apparent that he wasn't going to choose them no matter what, if they had really wanted him, they could've matched United's valuation.  They just didn't value him as highly as you did, nothing wrong with that. Maybe Haaland was, Bellingham was definitely not proven at a top level though until he moved to Dortmund. Either way, it's pointless to debate until its been a few years to see how he actually ends up. Paying £75m for Branthwaite straight up would be more like a deal the old management would do and more in line with what you're saying And you know what's funny? Even your team rated him but too scared of RM that they back out without even trying. I guess Liverpool aren't ""rated"" him also because of that. And I never said the money they value. The argument is if they rated as a top prospect, which they clearly do. Imo both deals are, although I agree the Yoro deal is probably better.  Also, If you're talking a kut Bellingham/Haaland to Dortmund and not to Madrid/City it's also really not comparable looking at the prices.  The Yoro deal just gives me Sancho vibes > Even your team rated him but too scared of RM that they back out without even trying.  What on earth are you on about? That wasn't reported anywhere, it was reported that we were interested for the right price, but expected the player to go to Madrid. Once it became clear the player wasn't going to Madrid we could've bid but chose not to because he wanted assurances that he'd play regularly that we couldn't offer.  Not to mention putting an 18 year old on £115k pw would mess up our wage structure. I mean even Sancho we were initially priced over 100m until it came down to £60-70m. I think we are all just excited that we finally got a highly rated youngster CB over Madrid after missing out on Varane all those years ago tbh haha"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* That top 5, though. More than half of what they spend.   Antony just made everyone at the club look bad.  Hojlund and Yoro still just raw talents and we haven't even seen the latter yet.  Casemiro was great for a season but very poor long term planning. Also makes no sense getting him after failing to get Frenkie.  Then there's Mount and we still don't know why they got him.   At least Casemiro was amazing that first season, but overall... You wonder if they could use this budget a bit more effectively... >Screenshot the page of transfermarkt   ""OC"" lmao The more I think about it the more ridiculous Antony was as a signing. Like even if he would've done a decent job, that is such a ridiculous amount of money. You could get some of the best and most proven wingers in the world for that. I really don't get United decisions. They clearly had no confidence with Ten Haag and were searching for replacements before FA cup. Then he wins it and suddenly all's well enough to give him extension and chequebook to spend more Jonny Evans may actually be his best signing for what weve been able to get out of him. The problem with Manchester United is not the front office or managers, the problem is the desperation to be good immediately. They need to have a longer term plan. I just don’t think fans will accept that, and instead of allowing young players time to develop the media and fanbase is toxic that managers have no patience and young players lose confidence. That Dubravka loan was so random [deleted] i know antony basically become a meme but dear lord that mount transfer is awful. 95M  He must be a top player in the world now😭😭🏆🏆 It will be funny if they play well with Amorim  The two free transfers were his best ones I remember being downvoted for saying EtH is a typical Dutch manager mainly buying players from NL and got downvoted like crazy, yet 10 players of this list have a past in NL. If any other club had signed these players they'd be one of the best. The players have underperformed but there's got to be something deeper in the club causing so many solid-great players (and managers) to suddenly play like shit. That money that was paid for Mason Mount is absolutely hilarious. One year left on his deal at Chelsea and then he ends up injured for the majority of his year that United signed him anyway. Tbf, the only real disaster signings were Antony & Mount. Bar Casemiro, the rest are relatively young and could stay with the squad long term and improve under a new manager.   The Casemiro signing is a weird one, we haven't sorted out our midfield since Carrick left. That has to be the priority for Amorim, Ugarte looked great under him so hopefully that's a huge step in the right direction. In hindsight it’s incredible how many signings were poor and overpaid Wow, top 5 has like 2 players that were worth getting for the price.  Antony should have been a jailable offence, Case was a case of another club fleecing united since they are desperate for stars, Likewise with Mason.   I think there are a couple of rules united could do well adhere to for transfers:  1. If a player is on a downward trajectory- Chances are that the added pressure of united won't magically make him change course and become a better player  2. If a player out there is extremely hyped but there's zero interest from Real, Barca or Bayern - Then chances are he is not good enough. We can argue if they should have gone for different targets but this list mostly underscores their terrible negotiators. They massively overpaid pretty much for every single player and gave them ridiculous salaries on top. If only they got him that Frank lad , he would've conquered the world This level of failure in recruitment should be studied Fucking hell I legitimately keep forgetting Mason Mount is there I mean, apart from Onana there is no undisputed starter there, right ? They have made terrible decisions over the years its insane Ajax's double agent Genuinely astounding how poor their scouting really is. Their defensive line would be pretty stacked if any of them could manage to stay fit for more than five minutes. Not gonna get into the obvious one but 273 million on Zirkee, Hojlund, Onana, Ugarte and Martinez is really something to behold. Dreadful business Cost aside maybe 2.5 good players signed? Which ones do you guys think were actually good signings? Onana has been decent right? Jesus christ, this is some Bartomeu level deals Crazy that Malachia was his first signing and is still there. I genuinely can't remember a game with him He also sold this guy for £25m… not great business either  https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c2e772xvx37o.amp 9M to loan Amrabat LOL What a waste of money, none of these player are world class or close to it. casemiro edging 30 when he signed. Antony, Casemiro, and Mount.  3 absolutely shocking transfers. Remains to be seen how a decent part of them end up. 3/5 of that top 5 is dire tho. Atleast Case has some goals and played matches Jack fucking Butland?! Over 600 million euros spent in the 2.5 year period…. After spending loads for years already. Manager fully backed, 300 of that mil on  Ajax players… truly one of the most shameless things we will ever see.   But it doesn’t matter. United revenues so high they can just piss money away for the next 2 decades with no repercussions. He's gone lads. This sub is milking everything possible about ten Hag. Weird weird obsession. Top 6 are all poor signings but even than Antony stands out by far De ligt is the only great player he signed.... De ligt is like the old school United player, player who plays for the badge, similar to someone like Roy Keane You get to 300 mil spent in the first 4 players….. I mean holy fuck Mount PR machine was on overdrive for years. Him being young and English made everyone overlook the underlying stats and areas of struggle. Buying Hojlund for 70+ million wasn't a good decision. >Antony just made everyone at the club look bad  We blaming the goat for being too good now? Mount was as seen as the perfect ETH player who can press like crazy but versatile. Got Mount and sold McT... why? Hojlund got sold as if he was the real deal, much like Martial.  Man u loves getting fleeced. I broadly know high-profile players, at least by name. Genuinely, who the fuck is Yoro?   I saw him on the list, saw the transfer fee and was like ?????! What do you mean, it's Original Creenshot! Timeline:  * Internal scouting reports told them not to go higher than £25m  * Quoted £40m by Ajax  * Retreated  * United failed to find a better player  * Went back in for him weeks later and price went up to £86m  * Congratulations on your order, you have now earned a 5% discount on your next purchase from the Ajax superstore [deleted] You can get one kvaravichelia with that money They could've bought Kane with that money, lmao. (Though I doubt he'd actually have transferred to them, tbf) how we felt about Pepe  that transfer turned out to be actual fraud done by Raul Sanllehi, what the fuck was ten hag's excuse  Edit: I was focusing on the second sentence of what I replied to. I thought he was alright, much better than Anthony, but at most a £35m player Liverpool did the same thing with Rodgers. They were ready to fire him, decided not to and then went on the sign Benteke only to fire Rodgers 3 months later. I do think that the transfers this summer were more 'club' transfers than the previous summers. And Ugarte really felt like a player ten Hag didn't even want, which could be the case given he's previously worked under Amorim. I don't really have any worries about de Ligt, mazra, Ugarte or yoro working with his system, Zirkzee the jury is still out on. The extension was more of a technicality, automatic trigger. Its not like the situation a few years ago with Jose. Also fans have to realize this isn't FIFA or FM Manager. Ten Hag had veto power and influence, perhaps too much influence but these decisions involved other people as well. Do we really think Ten Hag said get me Antony at 80m! Or After missing on on FDJ, pushing for an older Casemiro who is almost the complete opposite in profile? Exactly, win now = suck forever No the problem was definitely the board and scouting before this summer too. Yeah but then you look at those signings and think wtf is that He got a league cup medal for it as well, not bad for two games work. Erik Ten Haggle Truly a disgrace he wasn't nominated for the ballon d'or Antony and Mount would flop at any top club, they are average players Can't cope with the pressure playing with the biggest club in the country [deleted] Not scouting, decision making. #5 hasn't even made his debut☠️ [deleted] Martinez I actually think Mount has played good for United, the main two problems are that he is injured ALL THE TIME, and Utd spent 50-60m on a player with 1 year left on his contract No way you would say this if he was still at Chelsea. tbf Mount did have a 11G+10A season it just happened to be mostly from set pieces. He was great for us for 2 years straight and played absurd amounts without a rest until he started getting injuries. He'd be good for United if he wasn't injured all the time  The fact that he left sucks, but let's not rewrite history Mount was living off his 2021 performances especially in the UCL where he was genuinely one of the top 15-20 players itw. Reminds me of our Torres signing - player who used to be in form, gets signed by rival club as form starts to dip and then he completely flops. If he's who you point to in that list…. He has immense potential, but he just doesn't get enough service   He has 3 shots till now in total, and 1 of them is a goal Hojlund already statistically an elite finisher and the rest of what he needs can be taught. Finishing generally is tough to develop (like Timo Werner ....).  If he went to City he'd get 25-30 goals a year and no one would say anything.  He's the last guy I worry about in that list.  For me the mistakes were Mount and Antony. Mount = Bruno honestly looks awful 90% of the time. And Antony... no need to explain at this point. Maybe the fee is high, but he does definitely have talent. He’s still raw and needs nurturing, as well as getting better service, but if he’d gone into a more settled side no one would have concerns about the fee. That's on you tbh I read that as cream shot at first, god help me😭😭 I wish i could be a fly in the room of the Ajax board when they heard United was willing to pay the fuck off price. Also from São Paulo store, Antony and Casemiro's deals gave us a needed bump in our budget. It was ETH who insisted on him. Didn’t think United rated him.  Murtough was so sluggish on every decision. Whitwell wrote an article about all the young stars that were found by United, only to go somewhere else bc Murtough and his staff would drag their feet on signing them. Even some kids who really wanted to join and were waiting and waiting for months eventually gave up and signed elsewhere. And on multiple occasions he did something like Antony where there was no real plan and he panic bought players towrds the end of the window and over paid for them.   Such a moronic way to run the club and people keep bringing up the recent past as if United will be ran like that moving forward with the likes of Berrada and Ashworth at the helm. I'm honestly surprised United didn't get lower than 6th or 7th before ETH got there. Think we lost interest around the 40-50mil mark Cute how you seem to think Antony would ever have been available for under 40 million. Decent try Pepe was a good player, just didn’t suit Arteta’s system. He had more goal contributions for Arsenal than Antony and Sancho put together for Man Utd. Pepe also wasn't on as high of wages. He wasn't cheap, but he wasn't \~£200k/week (I think he was more in the 140k/week range). Always felt bad for Pepe. If it hadn't been for that messed up transfer fee, I think most would look back on him as a decent player who just didn't quite work out. Didn’t Chelsea do the same with Tuchel and Aubemeyang? How he survived that 6-1 loss at Stoke is beyond me. I read the book How to Win the Premier League a little while back, which documents his and Klopp’s time at the club. Apparently he was told on several occasions Benteke wasn’t the player the club should sign but completely ignored the data analysis on what they recommended. The club tried to guide him but he always thought he knew better. And now with another manager, they'll redo the cycle all over again Antony I believe it was more of a ""if you want me to succeed get him at any cost"", casemiro yeah more like PR/commercial move to sell shirts since they didn't get the main target I always assumed the Ronaldo deal was boardroom driven, instead of managerial. Such a big piece of business to do under an interim manager. 4 of the 10 most expensive players on this list were signed this summer. Ok fair enough that one has been injured, but it doesn’t seem to me like the scouting and the decision making improved dramatically. Really which signing? I mean Antony has turned out horribly, but at the time he was highly coveted based on his performances with Ajax. buy high, sell low. 90m was way too much for Antony but he was decent for Ajax. Way better than he's been for you lot anyway And Anthony Martial was Joel Glazer’s favourite player and was quoted comparing him to Pele. Ambitious managers are lured to United by the legacy SAF built just to find out there are a bunch of silly monkeys on the floor above. Just to contradict slightly, we never refused to signed Caicedo, there’s actually a really weird sorry about that.  Basically Caicedo had 3 different agents all claiming to be his representation and all trying to secure deals for him, nobody knew what was going on and it wasn’t until Brighton used a contact at the club they knew to find out was they able to get him.  Essentially United and all the other clubs were talking to agents that were just trying to scam them. I know. Just wanted to include Martinez.  I mean yeah depends on your ambition I guess. If United wants to get back to where they once were these players aren't gonna help. Martinez certainly isn't ""brilliant"" lol.  Yoro obviously excluded and Casemiro wasn't a bad signing but turned out to be bad. The others are either just mediocre or simply bad signings. Onana as well. They aren't wordclass and will not help United back to title winning seasons. Yeah they look monumentally better while pressing with him, it's just we've barely seen him I said this while he was at Chelsea, never thought he was our best player, always thought he was overrated because of being an English academy kid. His goals came in buckets against mostly lower table teams, his assists came from set pieces, very little open play creativity, poor performances against bigger clubs. He was not great, he was very good in a system that allowed him a lot of freedom and to generate high volume stats that immediately fell off when he didn't have five world class players and a world class coach to make him look better than he was. Jorgi, Kante, Silva, Rudi, and RJ were clearly better in some combination the CL year, the year after RJ was hurt and Kovacic had to carry more of the midfield and was still better than Mount. The season Tuchel left Mount nosedived. Others are known as bad transfers. People hardly talk about Hojlund. He has potential, but you should never pay more than like 45 mil on just potential (unless it's like Yamal or Endrick type potential) I imagine it somewhat like that Wolf of Wall Street phone sales scene: https://youtu.be/c1Vtzn3MZyA?si=rWqJa_Gv7HBHxVpY how are finances at SPFC these days? Ultimately spent enough to not finish too low. Money poorly spent still provided some value. It's just with a proper plan and the level of spend, United could have one of the top four squads in the world. Instead they might not even have one of the top four in the EPL. I mean they spend like 300mln on players that often don't even play and when they do they are not good enough.     For 300mln I'm 100% sure they could get both Kvara and Osi, then just get some new CDM next to Mainoo who is already balling and your team is more or less good.     Then they have like 300mln spend on defenders that they still have in their team, for that money you could get really elite pair of defenders that are ready every week. I think that was relatively cheap though. Benteke was our second largest transfer at the time. Also, the fact that we managed to sell him for no loss to Crystal Palace is a shock. I mean god I hope not. This is the next test for the new footballing structure. For sure though if they are going to play 343 they certainly need reinforcements at CB and wing back in addition to all their forward problems. Sigh.... This is not true. FFS.   If you look at the team Ten Hag inherited the only right winger we really had was Elanga. United looked at Antony early that summer. Ajax said something like 60m and United said no thanks. Fast forward those two losses, its late August so they enquire again because Antony and his agent were pushing for the move. 60m because 80 or whatever because  of United's poor hand in negotiations. Edwin Van der Sar even said we wanted to get the highest amount possible. I don't blame Ten Hag, I actually blame United hierarchy for not having a suitable alternative.  Same thing with Casemiro. We wanted FDJ, Ten Hag wanted to build his team around him. When that didn't happen, again there was no alternative, United went back to the old way of talking to agents, that's how you get United literally taking out a revolving credit line to sign both players late in the window. Couldn't they get Antony for cheaper if they had tried in June instead of August? Ole wasn’t interim at that point tho.  Ole obviously wanted a striker than summer but the club didn’t seem to be bothered. And then near the end, Ronaldo obviously became available and club moved for him, kind of ticking the striker box, bringing in a big name the fans adored and would sell stuff.  But it kind of made some sense on paper, given our lack of goal scorer up front. That's not true. Antony was a good player for the Eredivisie but not even close to being the biggest talent in that Ajax squad. Just check out his stats. They're good for a starting 11 player for Ajax but nothing special fly high, crash deep [deleted] Well you might be the only one. Constantly heard Chelsea fans claiming he was better than Foden. For a player whose number 1 asset is his ability to lead the press, also returning 21 G+A makes him incredibly handy. But... he'll never be that player again due to a combination of injuries and moving to United. We didn't have a single world class forward when he was doing well and he was our main source of creativity and had a goal in him too, but your genius take is that players like Kante, Rudiger, Silva, etc. (only players who'd even be considered to be world class) were making him look much better than he was?  He fell off when he was injured, he's still shown glimpses of his old self at United but can't stay fit  Mount is shit but all I see is praise for players like Sancho, Neto, Madueke, etc. now, who are all worse than Mount was for us both statistically and with the eye test lol I mean he's 21 in his 2nd season, I’d say it's fair to give him more time. No striker would be successful in the car crash of a system Ten Hag had. Textbook United tax in his case tbf, cheaper price was quoted earlier in the summer then Atalanta kept putting the price up because it was United Bad, we're kinda stuck being a club that didn't focus on paying our bills for a better future like Flamengo and Palmeiras but we also don't have someone with a lot of money to invest in us like Botafogo and Atlético-MG, so we're able to compete but have to sell our best players every season. I was talking about his spelling of Kvaratskhelia haha Mate it's utd they don't usually do smart They though 60m was too high, weren't going to pursue, than panicked after those poor results in August. I think it was feasible for a fee in the 60s, but they wanted Martinez and Ajax weren’t prepared to lose another key player, so we had to pay a massive premium to get Antony. Ahh, you're right, I had it in my head that it happened in the period between Ole and Ten Hag, but it happened right near the end of Ole's time. He was a rising young Brazilian talent who excelled in the Champions League and was an established starter on a very good Ajax team. I agree his price was inflated, but it was still seen as a good addition at the time. How so? What's so ridiculous about my take. None of those players would make minutes at City or Liverpool. Now I get United wasn't in a position to get the best of the best. But they could certainly have done better than this lot.  And I'm not saying all there signing are bad. De Ligt I thought was a good signing for example although his current form is not backing that up. So was Casemiro. Mazraoui is a decent signing as well. Mount had such a weird rep with our fans, felt like half the fanbase loved him, and the other half acted like he pissed in their cereal every morning. And now he's gone the half who hated him laugh at his injuries and act like he isn't an academy grown lad. There was a a pretty even split I'd say. The ones that thought he was the greatest player of all time were very loud but you can go back and see many people slating him even in his best season because honestly he was incredibly overrated. Never thought he should have been POTS twice, especially over any of our other midfielders at the time. One of the most upvoted Chelsea votes I remember seeing was Foden holding a fish Mount holding the CL trophy. Foden would then go onto win the CL. Mount may have been better for a couple of seasons though. But he wasn't creative or a reliable goal scorer. We were winning because of our insanely tight control of games. He had more freedom than any of the other forwards and I don't particularly rate his positional discipline or ability to play as a real midfielder. Also, you're naming wingers which was ironically the worst position for Mount to pretend to play. 70m for a player who still hasn't really come good after two seasons and still unsure if he would fulfil his potential that's sad to hear [deleted] Lmao, just take a look at his fbref pages in 20/21 and 21/22, in 20/21 he was still a bit raw of course but shot creating actions, progressive passes/carries are all quite good. In 21/22 his numbers are similar to the likes of Bruno, Saka, and even better in some areas. Baffling take considering his creativity and ability to press/work hard are by far his 2 best traits.  Never said he was a ""reliable goal scorer"", I said he had a goal in him. His goal scoring tally in his best season (21/22) with us were higher than Bruno and just 1 below Foden.  > We were winning because of our insanely tight control of games  Interesting that you completely dropped the whole ""the world class players around him were making him look good"" because you realized how clueless you sound. If you think Mount didn't contribute to of our wins and that ""insane control"" then you're genuinely watching a whole different sport.  > Also, you're naming wingers which was ironically the worst position for Mount to pretend to play  Yet he still had better numbers, stats, and pressed more than all of them combined? Mount often drifted to either wing depending on the game/situation under Tuchel too, combined with Reece and Chilwell often. He's better than every single winger/10 profile (hell, even forwards in general) we've had during or after his time barring Palmer and Jackson He's only played 1 season, this is the very beginning of his second, he's 21 and we knew we were getting a young raw forward. Ignore the downvotes. Regardless of his age and the fact that he's only had 1 season in the PL, I just don't see a 70m player there. A club like Man Utd can't afford to have a striker who will score once every 5+ games and whom frankly isn't a threat most games.   Don't forget that we're the same team that's waiting for a 27yo player (Rashford) to become consistent...   Same club that held on to Martial and Lingard for way too long for similar reasons.     I seriously see Hojlind and Zirkzee taking the same route due to the outlay on them.  That manager will do a decent job the first season and squeeze into top 4. and then struggle the following 2 seasons and then get sacked. Rinse. Repeat. This is United now. Mount Stans are a different breed, let me make it easier for you, our world class players were all defenders and midfielders giving us a tremendous control of games which is why we won. I know that might be hard to grasp because you probably only know about G+A. Mount being deployed as a winger in those games was football malpractice and I'm glad we have actual wingers now, although Noni plays a lot like him, head down, poor vision, tons of bad shots in the wrong moments. It's 70m and he hasn't even done anything remarkable. Because he's only had 1 full season under terrible management"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/soccer) if you have any questions or concerns.* lol Vermereen got on this list while playing only half the season It’s mad that Mainoo’s on there when he missed the first 3 months of the season through injury For comparison, Jobe Bellingham had 3755. we need to seriously cool it with Mainoo and Nacho, great move my MUFC to deny him to the olympics cause he needs rest man. can't see these brilliant players with such bright futures being ran into the ground Feel like it's super irresponsible for teenagers to be playing that many minutes. A lot of them are going to burn out really quickly because of it. I hope Mou goes for Yasin Özcan, that kid has potential and we need a lot of Turkish players because of the foreigner rule Important to note, Garnacho has another ~1000 minutes logged in all the other club competitions which isn't accounted for here.  Would assume he is quite a few places higher, if not outright first for minutes played this season in this age bracket Hato was the player with the most minutes for Ajax this season, crazy talented Yamal will be knee-free at the age of 20 If Barcelona drains him like this Sucks Mosquera doesn't want to play for Colombia. If this included Championship players it would look a lot different.  Archie Gray - 3603 Restes should be rested And Hato only just turned 18, crazy stat. No other PL team Delorge is a cracking player! **Didn't include our play offs so here's Belgium.**  Delorge 3553'  Dwomoh 2390'  Stroeykens  2379'  Spileers 2157' Hey i8 Only two players from Premier League and both is from Manchester United. Something I can proud of my club. Flick we please rest him 57 appearance between club and country at 16 😭 RemindMe! In June 1st 2030 to see if he dosent end up like pedri Worst part about this list is that it only counts league games. Hato played another 1500+ minutes in different competitions for ajax. It's even worse than this Why is simple Jack on the main pic Only Kayode from Serie A, huh? I thought Urbanski from Bologna got plenty minutes. Yildiz only played around ~1100 minutes across Serie A and Coppa, so understandable. One of those stands out from the others Rip rkc Waalwijk Could have been more for Kayode, but Dodo was WAY ahead of schedule. It seems Lamine will have played 4000+ minutes by 19 Chelsea scouts all over this thread. WZE My starboy stay safe Lamine yamal Will have to retire aged 22 at this pace U don’t want a pedri situation We're gonna run Jamal's body out of fitness like we did with Ansu and Pedri aren't we? what are the ""top ten leagues"" and what makes them top leagues? [removed] Fucking insane how much he played before the move So did Mainoo. Was injured in preseason until sometime around xmas. That looks so wrong with the Atlético logo godamn man, gotta treat him right And Vermeeren despite sitting on Atleti's bench for half a season If he played for a team like forest or palace you would of never heard of him That's crazy [deleted] Ten Hag has been pretty aggressive with managing their minutes, its the best he could do with the injuries.  Bigger question is whether the club will bring in the rotation options needed to help make that job easier.   https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5523314/2024/05/29/garnacho-mainoo-hojlund-man-united/ Nacho is 34 and just won cl, hope this helps His name isn’t Ignacio  [deleted] Got to be worried about Yamal, it's only a matter of time before he's logging heavier minutes for Spain as well We have no choise but to play Neves, he's our best player right now. UEFA/FIFA really need to put in some measures for any players under 18 imo.   Limit the minutes they can play across a month and then number of consecutive games. I've been seeing a lot of reports that we already signed with him and are just waiting to announce it You're right, this is only league minutes, but the other people can play in cup competitions too, and it doesn't take too long to figure it out. Here's the top 10 from the OP list, but for total minutes according to Transfermarkt  1. Neves has like 1,500 more minutes in cups for a total of 4,300 2. Hato has 1,000 more minutes for a total of 4,162 3. Restes has like 800 more minutes, 3,870 total 4. Yoro has 1,000 more for 3,690 5. Garnacho has 1000 more for 3,574 6. Delorge has 900 more for 3,553 7. Mosquera has 200 more for 3,250  8. Ozcan has 200 more for 3,190  9. Yamal - 2,955 10. Fernandes, I don't eve know which Fernandes this is  So Garnacho goes up to 5th, but Neves has by far the most minutes from cups and goes from 8th to 1st on the list It is the same for Warren Zaire emery that has played 3326 minutes for PSG this season. And we're going to do it sadly. The fact he plays as a starter for us shows the club's financial situation and the lack of squad depth.  Don't get me wrong he's very very good,but he shouldn't be playing this much at 16 Why? League with more league games has players play more games. More at 9. [https://www.transfermarkt.nl/meisteeinsaetze/gesamteinsaetze/statistik/2023/ajax/yw1/saison\_id/2023/selectedOptionKey/8/land\_id/0/altersklasse/u19/yt0/tonen/plus/0/galerie/0/sort/gesamtminuten.desc](https://www.transfermarkt.nl/meisteeinsaetze/gesamteinsaetze/statistik/2023/ajax/yw1/saison_id/2023/selectedOptionKey/8/land_id/0/altersklasse/u19/yt0/tonen/plus/0/galerie/0/sort/gesamtminuten.desc)     If you include cup + european games as well, Hato has the most minutes of any teenager this season. And as you said, 18 years old while many in the list are 1-1.5 years older. So crazy It’s just this season though so that makes sense, United really did have a ton of injuries and had no other choice than to rely on young stars to do some lifting.   Evan Ferguson is 19 and has already played around 2500 league minutes. I thought Lewis Miley would be on here but turns out he only got 1200 minutes. He probably would have made it but for the back injury he got in March though Urbanski got less than 1000' in the league: he was mostly a sub. And mostly in the second half of the season. Ansu wasn't overplayed, he got his leg destroyed by a horrible tackle This is the Top 10 european leagues according to the eufa country coefficient. It's in the name. Nine**teen**. Nah 19 is midtable  Seriously, he's been class so far but I'm genuinely terrified we're going to ruin another talent by overplaying them. Hopefully this window we can add some depth. People near had a coronary earlier in the season when ten Hag subbed him off because it cost us a game. Might have been Forest. Needs looked after and managed correctly. Doubtful. Adam Wharton is in a similar position and he’s talked about a lot. This is about minutes played not g/a To be fair, if this list didn't restrict to one league per country, the Championship would slip into 6th spot, just above Liga Portugal & Eredivisie, and causing Premier Liga (RU) to be removed. agreed. excellent article too ""hopefully"" amad doesn't get injured next season and either we get in olise or somehow antony realizes he is brazillian so that we can rotate garnacho with them shut up man goddamn No but Argentina does…. he's gonna be pedri v3 i can feel it in my mind  edit: fucking hell ppl getting quite annoyed at the implication of gavi being overplayed. sorry ig Where do you rank him among your previous Wonder kids like Enzo ? As shown from experience, if any of those reports are from Hüseyin Yücel we can safely disregard them. Mateus Fernandes Spileers makes a nice jump to 3.338 minutes then.   Not surprising since we've played 63 official matches this season. That’s way too many minutes man Unfortunately with so many levers pulled, winning now is the mentality forced on the club. Was hoping barca would take a break and slowly come back up but they are trying to chase money now Yeah I mean he's good enough to start but you'd hope you'd have someone else who also was at that level so you could ease the 16 year old into things a bit more lol  He wants to play for Spain instead. Because he was born in Spain Mosquera started 86% of games, 90% of available mins  Gray started 89% of games, 90% of available mins    OP made a valid point given this list is top 10 leagues and the championship is arguably up there in quality with czech/turkish/belgian leagues Precisely, one thing ETH has done well as opposed to some of our past managers is managing the youngsters' minutes - we saw it last season with Garnacho and Elanga, and again this season with Kwambala. He's been forced to play Mainoo as often as he is because we've rarely had any fit midfielders, and our two other DMs (Casemiro and Amrabat) have either been injured or forced to play in the defense when needed.   Hopefully we can learn from some past mistakes and sign a rotation option this summer. Na they didn’t have heavy injuries to their wingers, garnacho and Mainoo have been ten hag’s sons at United. Even the way he talks to them shows that he trusts them completely over a lot of senior players at the club. so the top ten European Leagues... Feel the same way with Alejandro. He played 30+ matches straight and you could tell near the end of the season his legs just weren’t there the same way Chelsea? No point entertaining him. Clicked on his profile and all the comments are just him trolling. [deleted] Garnacho isn't going. United have refused Argentina's request who is pedri v2? More like Ansu Fati Thankfully, as far as I'm aware, he's kept his mouth shut so far In my opinion,the presidency leads the club too much as a fan, instead of fixing the financial situation  in a few seasons and with a new beginning the club could have been mentioned among the best again. Will he be  called up for Olympic? That's a shame, looks like he has already played for y'all! But he has played for Colombia already! His point was that it “would look a lot different”. You’re saying it’s the exact same in amount of available minutes. Kwambala didn’t have his minutes managed really. He only played when we had an injury crisis at cb. Then he got injured. To be fair his other choice is to rely on players like Rashford or Antony. Or Amrabat. Makes sense that he trusts the youngsters more. And that's why he won't be in the Olympics team. What a sad existence that must be Why are you using a separate criteria for Jobe but not for every other player in this list? Perfectly aware. The guy above was saying that it’s a great move to deny him. The now deleted comment was about the UK. Gavi I guess Fati was horror tackled Don't worry.   It'll open soon again. I think he wanted to be the messiah figure. Promised to keep Messi, reality slapped him. When he fired the coach, he hired Xavi, a PR move because the latter's lack of experience was obvious and pretty much everyone thought he needed to take up assistant role/coach some other team before going to barca, Laporta pushed regardless. Pulled all kinds of levers cos' if they won, he would be the one who saved the club. Guess what? They won. And just like a gamble who gets pulled in deeper after every win, so was he, to the point where his ego took over and didn't care if he fired a recent legend of the club in probably the worst way he could have.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk Probably, he's played for them in previous U tournaments. Proof? Christian Mosquera, Valencia player born in Alicante has only ever played youth football for Spain (from u15 to u21) Well it would look a lot different wouldn't it, archie gray would be on top I’m sad he won’t get that opportunity but he definitely needs at least some rest It’s sad the over reliance some big clubs have on youth players. To the point they can play in the Olympics. He’ll have a chance next time no? He’s only 18? Ah right, got ya. Misread the comments. Apologies yep My bad, thanks for correcting my ignorance. Oh you are right lol. I confused him with Yerson Mosquera! He’s going to play the copa though.  I wish this was an off summer… Anyone want to explain how an ACL tear is related to playing a lot of minutes? Y'all are fucking idiots if you really think Gavi was injured because he was overplayed.  He tore his ACL, it had nothing to do with his minutes, plus this is his only serious injury so far, how is that the same as Pedri? Did someone say Colombian Edwin Mosquera? gavi was never overplayed like pedri, it's just a narrative that doesn't hold weight but just keeps getting parroted     same for ansu fati who had a bad injury"

Jesus. I had no idea Fofana cost us 80 😭 Thank God it's not my money. That's a devastating failure. Barring Van Dijk, none of the others have smashed it in a way that they're club legends.  And that's the reality of throwing money to solve problems. It doesn't work more often than not. ‘HARRY MAGUIRE Maguire 💀💀💀 Come on lads let's put de Ligt on there a third time ASHWORTH ABSURDITY WOOOOOOOO Yeah but if you put Maguire top of the list you drive more engagement from people who can laugh about how bad United are (were🤞)at transfers.  Never ignored, and all that. Might be considering him a lb Gvardiol was cheaper in pounds but the conversion rates were obviously different at the time It’s probably a mistake on purpose to generate engagement. Ajalanta Think they probably class him as a full back for this purpose which is dumb. If they put everyone on the list then Yoro isn't on it and they have nothing to post! Have to tweak it a little. They classify him as a left back now, but they really should take into account what position he played at the time he was bought. Who is the martinez from atalanta?   Had a little look but can't be bothered Once you show insane potential before the age of 20, it takes a lot of time for clubs to give up on you. It's highly likely that Havertz gets sold in a season or two and even he could end up on a similar list for forwards/AMs Anelka of CBs And each time would be, based on the numbers spoken about, a drop in fee He played left back more than 5 times so Transfermarkt decided he's no longer a CB. 21 games across two years. He’s on £200k per week btw with 5 more years remaining on his contract. De Ligt and Martinez as well. How is martinez not on the list. Wc winner, Copa America, fa cup and carabao cup. Maybe if we played for another club, he would get more recognition The more bizarre thing is that neither Atalanta or Juventus wanted to keep him that much Stones is definitely going to end up being a club legend. I'm not too aware of City pre-Robinho, but I'd say he's probably the next best City centre back after Kompany. He's not even in the list. Nonsense, Gvardiol’s transfer was more expensive even in pounds, £77.6m while maguire was exactly £74m. Man city had to pay 90m€ but since they are using pounds they paid £77.6m. No conversion rates are needed for this, gvardiol is officially more expensive in both currencies. Numbers won’t change since Man City already paid said amount. I dont think transfermarkt really have a need to do that Could've just made 18 year old and younger defenders. We might play Yoro as a DM in 3 years so get him off the list! Ben White should be on this list too then right? > they really should take into account what position he played at the time he was bought.  That doesnt make any sense, they should count what position the buyer wanted him to play in. And doesnt necessarily have to coincide with the position he was playing at the seller's team.  Bellingham is another example. Should he be counted as defensive midfielder? It's wrong  Lisandro Martinez came from Ajax They most likely confused Lucas Martinez Quarta with Lisandro Martinez not sure arsenal would sell havertz so suddenly, arteta loves him tbf, de Ligt is still a great CB and atleast a good rotational option for any big club out there. But yeah, people expected more of him by now Holy jesus ... With appearances like that, you'd think he was injured... Jury still out given he’s played 50% of league games in his two seasons due to injury.   No matter how good you are, you’re useless if you can’t make it on to the pitch half the time.  If that continues then he will categorically not be a good signing. This is a bit incorrect. That was a club record sale for Atalanta, they couldn’t say no to that when Romero wanted to leave.   Juve meanwhile didn’t really give him a chance, and keeping him after his defender of the year season was completely out of their hands at that point as Atalanta has the purchase option. I can think of 10-15 players that were more significant to City's success in the Pep era itself. Dias is technically better too.  Lad has averaged 20 Prem games a season in 8 years. Wasn't even a bonified starter for even one Prem win.  Hypothetically he may be considered but he'll be a low-tier legend if he even can be considered one. Casemiro played as a CB last year for a few games, shouldn't he be included too?  Such a dumb fucking list, man. Yes, €58.5m we paid for him, should be above Martinez. > they should count what position the buyer wanted him to play in.  That can change over time, so for the purpose of these lists the cleanest way to do them is to take the position they played at the time they were bought.   > Bellingham is another example.  Bellingham could well be classified as a CF/SS one day, then moved back to CAM, then DM, and each time he moves from 1 most expensive [insert position] list to another, it's impractical. /r/JustChelseaThings Gvardiol was placed immediately as a left back by Guardiola and has played 85% of the games in that position.   What makes you think Pep signed him as a CB and that wanted a CB when he signed Gvardiol?"

What's up with PSGs Liga NOS fetish? I'm just waiting for the eventual transfer for like 75M + Renato Sanches + Carlos Soler, followed by ""We couldn’t say no! He forced his exit! The offer was irrefutable! We tried everything, but the player's head was already in Paris!"" They already have Vitinha, Fabian Ruiz and Zaire Emery. Does it really need another player of the same type? I don’t get why we’re so desperate for him , we need a 10 / 8 more than a player of his profile ancient offend observation screw shocking automatic fretful mysterious encourage snatch   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Fuck off PiSSG, he's ours! You guys already have Vitinha anyway.  Edit: on a second thought, ok you can have him. We want the 90M + Vitinha. Don't like it? Fuck off! Will they play Vitinha and Neves together? I was curious to see if Martinez would play it in NT. Hope he comes to United, I'm pretty sure we're interested but not sure if we can afford him, he's hugely talented. Cannot be real 😂 This will go in the all time deals next to Felix Do they like, get to spin a wheel? It should be Renato Sanches? Would make sense position wise and he played for us too, it would also fit the yearly ""Renato Sanches back to Benfica"" sage, which has been going on for 8 years now. ""You get 90m€ and the content of this secret box"" Baseball trades have included ""a player to be named later"" many times, including at least three in history where the player was the same one. Jorge Mendes, Luis Campos and Antero Henrique all being very involved in our transfer policy. Their DoF is Portuguese, with ties to Mendes IIRC Our sporting director Campos loves to deal with Gestifute Portugal is a heaven for good footballers. I reckon when taking a punt on a player outside the big 5 it’s the best a long side the Brazilian Serie A and then both players combining a total of 15 mins playtime across a whole season. And then 3 years from now the player says he was forced to sign by both Mendes and Rui Costa, that said that the club well being depended on it.  We have seen this countless times, we know it by heart. If we didnt have the dumbest fan base in Portugal we would have kicked out those responsible for both literally stealing from the club and not doing enough to achieve our winning potential, instead we let it keep happening. forsen And 3 years later Joao Neves return to you after flopping at PSG Not the same type We can't afford him. no shot united lands him The next evolution of the transfer market. Gacha transfers Yeah, maybe it's raffle style. Wait what? Are you saying they did a trade that involved shuffling the exact same player back and forth? Roma had a PSG loan fetish (which failed) and now has a Ligue 1 fetish. Due to Friedkins on good relations with PSG. Now Ghisolfi DS at Roma. Kinda excited about the Ligue 1 fetish. Seems like sports directors usually go fishing in markets they are familiar with. Sure… but the price? There’s talent in L1 too but Campos would rather see the French diamonds go to the big European clubs for relatively cheap ( Man U buying one rn 40-50 ) while we pay 100m for Portuguese players so his best friend Mendes can eat well. Agree but this doesn't justify this ridiculous price tag. This money buys you someone like Odegaard who is 5x better than Joao neves But it's fine because we paid for an insurance company to pay for their injuries! only if you have an injury crisis Very similiar type. He is not someone who can play alongside all of them. If he joins, then its 2 out of those 4 who can play. They still need someone behind them, Neves is not that guy to play DM behind Vitinha and Fabian Ruiz Yup, the ""later"" part can be up to six months later, so there have been four times they've ended up just giving the player back. Usually because they sucked. what french diamond is manutd buying for 40-50M rn? OOF"

I am not sure why this is the case but most of the La Liga business happens in the week leading upto the season opener plus first week of the league and 2nd and 3rd weeks of the league right before the window closes meaning the last 2-3 weeks of the window. You would assume nobody is making a transfer and then all of sudden you see a random club bringing in on average 12 new players in the last 2 weeks of the window while the league has started.  Also La Liga teams are slow to peak cause they start the pre-seasons very late compared to other leagues and the average date where all La Liga teams are in super physical condition is first around the beginning of october.  That is why you see sometimes Sevilla getting into trash mode in the first of half of the season involved in relegation battle then slowly turn into a team of titans in the second half of the season going undefeated and unstoppable in that period Endrick, Mbappe and who? Is Espanyol struggling with FFP too? Surprised that Real Madrid is the team that signed least Free, besides the ~€125m signing bonus. Hey at least we didn't pay the oil merchants The Prem is the opposite Most Premier League teams peak early August even before the league begins. Arsenal is a great example they start pre-season 1st july and by the end of July they are in super peak physical condition like UCL final ready physical condition they bury teams coming to visit on the weekend before the premier league opener in the Emirates cup and I mean like 6-0, 7-1 etc etc Joselu was transferred in, then sold out Leny yoro. Isnt that the usual? Madid rarely need to buy more players I thought it was 150m, 50m yearly for 3 seasons? Tho majority of the opponents in the Emirates cup aren´t in peak physical condition like maybe just 20-30% in shape tho Arsenal has to get quickly in shape because they want majority of the time ahead start on city this year they didn´t succeded to get one as city started aswell early [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/03/real-madrid-sign-kylian-mbappe-psg) I was reading just says €125m spread over 5 years, not sure if it's evenly spread out or not. Was more of a tongue-in-cheek comment anyway."
