Too many bombs im getting numb to the sound Good signing..   With Mbapp√® gone they need a reliable striker who can score 20+ non-penalty goal a-season and at the same time that can bring many new supporters (he was the best african player in 2023 and Nigeria population is 200 million). Im just gonna repeat what I said in the last (deleted) thread. PSG have bought 2 strikers for 180 Mio Euros last summer. Absolutely insane My guess  Osimhen to PSG   Toney to Arsenal   Gy√∂keres to Chelsea Imagine a Leao - Oshimen duo Another striker? PSG going for the fifa 4-3-2-1 Doesn‚Äôt mbappe play as a left winger for PSG now? It would be more logical if they went for Leao, Rashford or Kvarashekelia It‚Äôs crazy they can offer him like 500k a week and it would still be massive discount as to what they were paying mbappe in salary pw not saying he wasn‚Äôt worth it of course but still. He'd be stupid to go to PSG, especially with Mbappe leaving. What a waste if he does go Great news Aight, pay No please, get Lautaro :( lmao really Don‚Äôt buy it. Not a word Wowi Gon√ßalo Ramos is gone if this transfer happens. Luis Enrique never wanted him. It was some Luis Campos/Jorge Mendes shenanigans (not that I personally didn't want him). PSG: Yes Every elite club should have at least 2 imo. I assume they‚Äôd move one of Ramos or Muani on if they get Osimhen. My bet is Ramos more than Chelsea As many as Barcelona levers üòÇ [deleted] I'd rather have Gyokeres than Toney if they go for a similar price I think we (chelsea) sign Sesko because we have an infatuation with young players I was just thinking the same thing....they can have leao for a easy 175 mil He's been playing through the middle for a couple of months now. PSG have Barcola and they'll get Simons back from Leipzig, so it probably makes sense to prioritize a goalscorer as Mbappe's replacement (even though they bought two strikers last summer) Rashford lmao it absolutely wasnt worth it unless you consider the "" state with infinite wealth using the club for sportswashing only "" angle I don't think he's ever moving. Hard for me to see him leave Inter for PSG.  Only way he'd get tempted to leave Inter is if Barca/Madrid/one of the top EPL teams came calling, IMO Inter are in a way better position right now and in a better league. Why we would he tempted to leave other than insane $$$$? PSG decision/management structure (NAK on one side, Campos on another, the coach of the month on one side, 'Doha' still taking some decision  on its own) is so weird.   But nothing can surprise me anymore after Antero Henrique  still doing some deal on PSG's behalf years after his departure Has he been bad though? Pretty crazy that you lot are moving him on after 1 season They just bought both last summer, seems a bit early to give up on Ramos no? Ramos is the obvious choice that makes most sense.   1. You get his agent more commission, which means he‚Äôs happy with the club, allowing us to also get Yoro since we‚Äôre both of their preferred choice.   2. Randal is more versatile. All our right wing might be out (not like it‚Äôs not possible) , and he can cover for them. Same thing for the left. Hmm, noted Living rent free in everyone's head Fuck it, I'll make it even more absurd:  Mbappe to Bayern  Osimhen to Liverpool  Toney to Real Madrid  Try to top that. Osimhen at RM would be fire I'd rather have almost anyone than Toney Rather have toney from what ive seen but havent watched gyokeres enough to say toney is definitely better That's what us (Milan fans) want if he leaves, but unfortunately Cardinale is an ass. I really hope Leao stays and Milan bought Osimhen but i'm asking too much lol Boehly just sat upright in his bed ""Get my phone!"" Yes thay's what they need, no disrespect for Kolo Muani and Ramos, but they need a striker with finishing abilities close to 20-30 goals minimum.  Maybe those can become the 9 they want but let's say all the things happening in PSG is going against that. Ramos could be very good tho, but world class? Idk, with time maybe but PSG does not have time especially if my boy Mboopipi is going Inter need money right I can only see it happening if they offer him double his current salary > Has he been bad though?  Neither good nor bad. He's only on loan anyway isn't he? So he's just returning to his parent club Ramos technically hasn't been bought yet, no? It was a loan with obligation, they don't normally be paid for until the seasons over  Edit. Turns out they already activated the buy option, and I missed it [deleted] Mbapp√© to Milan, fulfilling his lifelong dream  Jovic back to Real Madrid because Carlo specifically asks for him  Osimhen to Liverpool  Darwin Nunez to PSG  Toney to Napoli Mbappe to Halifax Town   Osimhen to Robin Hood FC  Toney to Botswana Meat Commission FC \+ Lukaku to Arsenal  nvm that's too realistic we love Chelsea's sloppy seconds And Kane at Arsen.. wait no Bendtner comes out of retirement. God, anywhere but Bayern please. Toney would be an amazing striker for you guys. No. We sold Onana last summer and every penny went back out. This summer we don't need that much so we probably won't sell a key player They‚Äôll likely raise it without selling him, I‚Äôm guessing Dumfries. My next guess is Asllani, and if someone brings out the cash Thuram could very well go too. [No he isn't](https://twitter.com/PSG_English/status/1727389265846518201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1727389265846518201%7Ctwgr%5E01f613f9df2601246f4991dcc77e4842dfae8480%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goal.com%2Fen-us%2Flists%2Fpsg-80-million-goncalo-ramos-loan-benfica%2Fblt9e00a90670508faf) We  actually end up buying him in december No chance to top that, I'm taking a bow. You can have Mbappe but keep Jovic please. I still belive in Jovic so fugg it Thanks mate, didn't know they signed him permanently already. In that case moving him on really doesn't make sense. Oh did you? My bad then, must have missed it [deleted] I do too but if it's what's needed to get Mbapp√© I'm willing to do the sacrifice. Yeah it flew kind of under the radar Where do I sign? I'll even to it for 10k/week lol. You will have Jens Petter Hauge back and you will enjoy it. 150k/week for 9 years, final offer."

You get an 180, and you get 180, everyone gets a 180 [deleted] My sole reason here is to glaze yamal so...  Dude it's so fucking cracked for a 17 yo I know Jude Is a great player but does he really have the same value as haaland Mbapp√© only being 4 years older than Bellingham is bizarre to me No Antony because my GOAT is priceless üêê [Exact same regurgitated content; exact same boring ""my player is better than your player"" discussions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e7bswb/most_valuable_players_in_the_world_following_the/) Germans underrated as usual Was trying to find Chelsea players in the list and then read the headline I feel Haaland is a much better fit for Madrid than Mbappe. Didn‚Äôt PSG try to buy Yamal for ‚Ç¨250 million? Bellendingham Give me yamal first out of all of those names That rodri evaluation is wild at his age, not sayin it's not fair, but it's wild Foden being more valuable than musiala is a joke. Musiala is twice the player and that‚Äôs coming from an Englishman Haaland is in a league of his own How the fuck is Haaland already? 24 years old. It feels like he was 19 just yesterday. Covid ruined my already poor sense of time These seem over inflated, except yamal. As a madridista Phew, the overhyping of young English talent is nuts. Yamal - 120m.  This is an absolutely insane amount of pressure to he putting on a 17 year old. Foden over Musiala, Wirtz or Rodrygo is a joke.  He barely makes the top 10 and he ain't better than 8 or 9, english tax is crazy. Damn I'll take Rodri for 130M Saliba? Honestly, seeing this list makes me realize how underrated valverde is. The guy is so freaking good and he‚Äôs not even in the top 10 most valuable players in the world. Why Bellingham is so overhyped ? Yamal down in tenth place is laughable Curious to see the most ""valuable"" XI who is paying 150 mil for Foden. LOL Isn't this the same list as the top 10 most valuable players in the world? Filtering on just champions league here makes no difference [deleted] Yamal at 10 is wild. 17 at 120M is insanity I'm surprised rodri is worth so much. He's the best midfielder in the world but he's also 28, I thought his value would be a fair bit lower than all these young bloods.  Haaland needs bumping up C'mon man... Prices keep going up until what point? There aren't a lot of clubs who can pay those fees. As if City would ever actually accept a transfer offer for Haaland Phil Foden's ON FIIIREEEE what happened to this comment section god damn Am I nuts or are five of them English-born? By today's standards, I wonder where would 24 yo Messi and Ronaldo rank, because no where they wouldn't be at least 300 M seeing the valuation of these players. I get that Pedri has been injured for so long that he‚Äôs faded out of the limelight, but man it‚Äôs hurts not seeing him up here. Quality-wise he easily competes with any midfielder on this list. He‚Äôs truly a gem. Something's wrong, there is only 3 English players Only Haaland is worth that money Wtf musiala is still 21?? Lol thats crazy Transfermarkt:  We can't decide who's the best player in the world right now, so we'll all give them 180 mil, yeah? Lol, Bellingham is not worth the same as Haaland, even despite being 3 years younger.  I‚Äôm not sure what value I‚Äôd put on it, but in terms of desirability, the rank would be:  - Haaland - Mbappe - Bellingham - Musiala/Yamal - Vini Jr - Wirtz  Then Foden/Saka & the rest (although Saka is clear of Foden).  - Still no idea what this is based on, where does Saka get his value? Can someone explain how the hell Bellingham is valued at 180mn?? What has he done till now? I see a combined ‚Ç¨720.00 Mil overrated shit up above üòÇ What teams are paying these fees in 2024? Seems like they didn‚Äôt want to decide who is better in the top 4, every body at 180! Four of the top 6 born in England Nobody would pay more for Foden than Yamal.¬† where havertz? Saka - LOL Saka wtf Saka 140m üòÇ I know Foden had a great season, but is he really worth more than Rodrygo? List is broken. John McGinn is absent. I would love to see someone try to buy Yamal for ‚Ç¨120m. Joke. He is worth ‚Ç¨200 Kinda crazy to think that yamal is a top 10 player in the world at 17. Only players id definitely put above him are Haaland, vini, Mbappe, Rodri, Bellingham, and maybe Kane. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs on the same level as players like wirtz, Foden, Saka, musiala, and rodrygo. i think odegaard has to be in here, he‚Äôs been our best player last season (i am an arsenal fan so i may be based but i do believe he should be top 10) This sub fucking hates Saka  He‚Äôs a bit overrated by Arsenal fans but monumentally underrated by this sub Why are people on Saka‚Äôs dick for. Just cause he doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúcool‚Äù celebration or flashy skills doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt even look at his stats for the last 5 years like lose me with that bullshit I say this as an Arsenal fan. Saka is overrated. Some of the takes on Vini and Bellingham in this thread.. I prefer not to speak Saka lmao what? 140 is way too high Brought to you by RM Why is valverde not on there? Foden still top 5 üòÇ. This dude is good but so insanely overrated with regard to market value since *years* Yamal worth 10 billion actually Yamal less than Rodri?? Nope Yamal is way undervalued, he should be as valuable as the top4. Saka? English tax? I‚Äôm not having Foden at 150m and Jude at 180m I‚Äôm sorry Saliba gotta be in there. Easily ‚Ç¨140 million In the real world, if Yamal were to be made available tomorrow, he'd go for at least ‚Ç¨100m more. Putting Foden above Saka is such obvious engagement bait. The internet really is nothing but trash these days huh. From my perspective their value should be much lower. Their wages to. Not out of jealousy, even though I like money too. But we‚Äôre now at a point where both to rights and tickets have become so expensive, that I‚Äôm not willing to pay for it anymore. Thereby loosing my interest. But sadly it‚Äôs a lost cause. Foden 150m wtf? Yamal should be worth more. Foden has been invisible for the past 3 months how the fuck is foden worth $150M? also where‚Äôs Antony When Haaland and Rodri go to Real Madrid for crumbs with City in League 2 next season, this list will be even more wild. Vinicius is not as valuable as Haaland or Mbappe lmao. Numbers speak and his aren't as good. Foden LOL If Saka is 140 (KEKW), Mbappe/Bellignham should be 280 and Palmer 200. Yamal behind Saka is also a travesty. Foden and Saka more valuable than Pedri is hilarious peak PL tax looking down the list, Harry kane is at $100 million. because i dont watch bundesliga can any bayern fans say if thats accurate?   seems a little high for being 31 years old I'd have Yamal , Rodri and Haaland tx , for my superteam. This may be a hot take but I would put Lamine at 180. He‚Äôs the youngest with most promise.¬† No way Foden is 150m. When Real Madrid get Wirtz and Xabi next season, they will really start cooking.  ^(also if the rumors of TAA and Davies are true.) Are Saka and Foden really that good? [deleted] They tried to with lamine Wait I‚Äôm confused why does the player need to be precisely 200m for PSG to activate it? What‚Äôs stopping PSG from activating release clause if player is 180m? IRL Mbappe is the most expensive. Be it social media, game performance and achievements / age.  180 mil for him would be a damn bargain. The type would make your government raise an eyebrow. I know that Transfermakt isn't as reliable as they pretend to be but those are some pretty fair valuations. Do you think these players would be sold for way less than 180m? Am i the only one that rather has one of the other 3 Foden didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ They don't go higher than eighty because the darts commentator otherwise wouldn't be able to yell it they are only trained up to 180. I think Bayern have a good Chance.  Hoene√ü said Wirtz is the Player they would spend big Money on.   They have remained in contact with his father/Management for years now.  They need a replacement for Mueller next season.  Musiala and Wirtz want to Play for the same Club one day.   But in the end its his decision alone. I can See both of them playing for Bayern some years and then move to the PL, Real or Barca when they are 25 to 27 years old. Attacking 8? Is that the new word for a #10? Does every top tier player HAVE to end up Madrid, Barcelona, Munich or Manchester? Isn't it more enticing to be in a club that's big/good enough to play in Champions League/compete for PL/Bundesliga/Serie A/La Liga title, but small enough that you can be a deciding factor and leave a lasting mark. Imagine winning CL with Leverkusen, 100x better than with Madrid that probably would have won it without you anyways. Same for Kvara in Napoli and Williams in Bilbao, for example If Wirtz comes to Madrid, we should start offloading people (and I'm not talking about Ceballos).¬†   I must admit that we have several box to box dynamo players and we're lacking creativity, but I hope that Arda develops his physique in order to transition to a role deeper on the field.   That being said, Wirtz would be a majestic signing. It's just I wouldn't us to be hoarders like Chelsea. I think City is most likely realistically but would love him at Liverpool. As we're now playing with a 10 he'd be a decent upgrade on Szoboszlai but can't seeing us spend that amount of money to get him.   Also keen to see how Macca plays as a 10 when we finally get a CDM. [deleted] Wirtz is a crazy Bar√ßa fan though Exactly what Arsenal needs tbf He‚Äôs joining the 180 club end the end of the season His marketing value is quite high [deleted] I think you need to look at how market value is calculated. They don't just sit in a room and say ""dang this boy is good, lets go with like.. uuuuhm.. 180 mil - yeah that sounds about right"".   Here are some factors that go into the calculation:  - Future prospects   - Age   - Performance at the club and national team   - Level and status of the league, both in sporting and financial terms   - Reputation/prestige   - Development potential   - League-specific features   - Marketing value   - Number & reputation of interested clubs   - Performance potential   - Experience level   - Injury susceptibility   - Different financial conditions of clubs and leagues   - General demand and ""trends"" on the market   - General development of transfer fees   - External factors such as the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences  There are a bunch more actually, but yeah. Market value is yet another metric you cannot really use to compare players. He's English. That's an automatic +‚Ç¨45m No. Neither does Vini. Why does everyone think Jude is overrated these days? He‚Äôs without a doubt a top 3 player in the world last season and was in the golden boot race as midfielder. And he‚Äôs only 21 3 years younger and 2 fantastic seasons on his back As a Madrid fan watching Bellingham play alongside Vini and Mbappe day in and day out I‚Äôd say that he is the best player in that team. And all three of them were better than Halaand last season Yes, if you actually watched football, you'd know how important he is for the team. He Is English, so of course he is I would put him over Haaland after last season. He doesn‚Äôt, he has more value since he‚Äôs the better player. Both are overrated tho¬† It‚Äôs more like English players overrated, Wirtz and Musiala are great but below the top 4, should be above Saka for sure, probably Foden as well. yes, Italians as well. Germans overrate German players and underrate English players, and vice versa. Saka and Foden worth more than Yamal is banter You think there are Chelsea players who are valued above 120 million? really?!  and Barca with their finances said no?! Foden did shoot man city to the premier league last year big time Like it or not but silverware is weighted heavily and that's why it helps to be in Real and City. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre pretty close. None are on the same level of Haaland, Vini, Mbappe, and Rodri, and sometimes Jude depending on the game. ‚ÄúComing from an Englishman‚Äù ü§£ not like he‚Äôs not the most hated English player Disagree. He‚Äôs on that level. In fact his value should be higher than saka when he‚Äôs performing better yet younger. It's not like the club are saying this, it's a random stats website. He was probably the best player in the PL last season, I‚Äôm a United fan and saying Rodrygo is better is crazy They're all really good and young players... I think the minor differences between their market value maybe because of the club they are at & the situation they are in  ... Rodrygo bro come on. You can't mention English tax and then act like Madrid tax isn't 5 times higher, I mean fuck Tchouameni might be the most overrated overpriced player on earth. If you asked me straight up if I could swap Yildiz for Rodrygo I would say hell no, Rodrygo for anything over 80 million is nuts. rodrygo is hilarious lol Defenders don't get the same market value hype, Bastoni and Saliba are much better than someone like Rodrygo but won't get the same hype. I think he was in the top 10 just one year ago, before the youngest ones in the list surpassed him during the season Last fall he did cr7 like numbers. Overhead kick in Euros, English.¬† JBPR - Jude Bemlingham PR [deleted] R Laughable because he shouldn't be on the list or because he's only in 10th place? Same people paying 140 for saka probably Rn it‚Äôs Haaland. But overall they‚Äôre all equals, outside of Bellingham who I do think is slightly worse than the other 3, but he‚Äôll be on their level v soon. Four of the top 6 haven't won an international trophy 5 of the top 10 either born or mostly raised in England üòÇ Absolutely, Rodrygo is overrated*IMO* Foden is definitely better than Rodrygo  Madrid PR has made this sub overrate Rodrygo so much DEFINITELY BETTER THAN RODRIGO BUT NOT VINICIUS People think Foden is worth more than Meatball, English tax is no joke. No offense but being arsenal's best player isn't really one of the requisites. [deleted] Forwards tend to be more valuable Thankless job  , his position.... But a manager's dream imo he cost the same as lamine he should, as should bastoni, but defensive players are always underrated. even van dijk in his prime wasn't in top 10 market value back in 2019 and 2020. Are you sure? Because barca rejected a 200m offer from psg. Don't see Saka winning the prem player of the year or winning the prem if at all mate Pedri hasn‚Äôt played a full season for 3 years Pedris injuries are the reason he isnt on this list, like it or not but it plays a big role in value. Saka is basically always playing Literally went to Bayern last year for similar amount of money and grabbed the golden boot and also was pretty close to break the record of highest goals ? Kane is still putting up numbers  European golden boot last year, ucl top scorer  If anything it should be atleast 110-115 If endrick is 60 million then yes these people should be a bit more Saka is way overrated. Foden is properly rated imo It's more likely he's not here because of his age His market value is something like ‚Ç¨50m Did they really? I hadn‚Äôt heard about this C'mon do you really believe those Spanish journalists especially from Barcelona? They even said City were interested in yamal after three or four matches when we didn't Because Neymar's release clause was ‚Ç¨222m and is to date the only fee over ‚Ç¨200m. Also it's a joke. it was a joke Yeah, I think there are at least 5 clubs in Europe that would have the 180m transferred by tomorrow morning to sign Mbappe on a long-term deal if Real Madrid would sell him for some obscure reason. Is it true that his signing fee for Real Madrid was 150m? as long as the team that buys him doesnt have 3 LW's Mbappe is worth less as a transfer because he's already on massive wages. Unlike with most other players on this list you wouldn't get away with paying him a bit lower wages because he's young. Sure but they're still just made up. It's just a bunch of people deciding ""yeah, that sounds about right"". It's no different from FIFA overall scores. They can sound  accurate and fair but they don't actually correspond to anything real. Mbappe for more, Haaland is right. Vinicius maybe. Bellingham isn't worth more than Musiala or Wirtz Sadly that‚Äôs the culture of European football Obviously not. There's still Paris and London.  >Does every top tier player HAVE to end up Madrid, Barcelona, Munich or Manchester?  Yes because they're generally the clubs that pay the highest salary and players love their salaries  >100x better than with Madrid that probably would have won it without you anyways.  For the fans, not for the players. A Champions League is a Champions League especially if you don't have none. And being a top tier player isn't a guarantee you will get one.   Look at Reus or Harry Kane  And players like to play with players that are great or under coach that are great because everyone is trying to maximize their chance of success instead of hoping on getting lucky on stars aligning. Imagine committing your career to Leverkusen lol If Endrick develops well you could sell Rodrygo and buy Wirtz. That would make your squad much more balanced. (And I would love Rodrygo at Arsenal üòÅ) [deleted] modric was too, they are professionals tho [deleted] Wirtz isn‚Äôt physical enough that Arteta would make that big of an outlay on him, √òdegaard is the only token twink in that side that‚Äôs allowed to not be a physical monster. Besides, Arsenal need a left winger a lot more than they need a creative midfielder seeing as they already have one of the best creative midfielders in europe (see the aforementioned twink) if by marketing value you mean RM tax, English tax and ""doing the most basic celebration and pretenting it's his own"" then yes indeed he has massive marketing value And he's english And even then it's stupidly wrong.  Imagine Barcelona even thinking about selling Yamal, his potential is worth more to them than 120m You forget the most important metric: Contract length and pay. This is transfer market, they OPENLY say they are just a bunch of guys making this shit up. If you know transfermarkt.de your first part is not far off  German Video explaining it:  Your factors playing a role, but the value is decided by Community-people in discussions  https://youtu.be/Mj6jbxJ89Jg?si=bYrtqlFm4T8L4Dxr They're still attaching arbitrary figures to all of those variables, so it's still a bullshit metric. The idea that this is some scientific thing, and half the players ended up on the top with the exact same valuation, means that they really are pulling numbers out of their ass. Vini is absolutely worth as much as Haaland. His performances in big games in the CL and league over the last 5 years have proven this. No one can remember more than 3 months ago. He is a bit overrated, but he's still world class. If that makes sense. There's a huge chunk of people that think Jude is already Zidane or Messi. Now he well might become someone of that stature, but come on. Putting the horse before the cart and all that. He arguably wasn't top 3 in Real going for full season. Yeah, first half of season he was probably their best, but for RM first half is definietly less important. Going for full season Vini and Kroos were definietly better with Ruediger (as leader of defense) having strong case for 3rd place. Add to it players like Haaland and Rodri, Wirtz, Kane and there are probably quite a few who deserve shout out (Olmo robbed of MVP for Euro...)... Position in top 10 for that season? Definietly. Top 5? Arguably. Top 3? Nah. And definietly not ""without a doubt"". So you saying ""Without doubt"" do the overrating. he played as a striker, not a midfielder. and he was nowhere in the second half of the season. he's good but not Haaland level good. In no universe is Jude for Madrid more important than Haaland for City. Haaland can‚Äôt even be overrated, he‚Äôs so good. However, Saka being valued at 140mil. is crazy. He‚Äôs not even worth half of Haaland. It‚Äôs not entirely based on player quality. It‚Äôs much easier to buy Wirtz from Leverkusen than Foden from City. Musiala wil be up at least +20 once his contract situation fixed. I think Musiala still is underrated. I think he is better than Wirtz Foden and Vinicius. musiala is english Not really, there isn't a single Italian playing to the level of anyone on this list (I'm italian). Just wrong The value of Saka, Foden and Yamal is irrelevant because none of their sides would let them go for anything resembling fair value for the buyer. They‚Äôd all ask for a world record fee Yamal had his true breakout at the euros mate, its not like hes gonna spawn with a market value at 180m you missed his joke. Cole Palmer is worth more than some on this list This sub is really a bunch of kids huh, suddenly the best players last season who were the main reasons why their teams had the success they had, are highly overrated & overhyped just bcz they played bad in the euro & copa If he continues how he's playing right now till the end of the season, sure. Performing better? Saka‚Äôs clearly the better player¬† Funny how other people in this thread think that 120m is underrated. Oh . I thought Rodri or Haland were better, cuz you know you guys are pushing Rodri for Bdor or heck even Halaand(both of whom ghost in important matches) but yeah ig .. sure foden was the best >Rodrygo for anything over 80 million is nuts.  Only Salah is a better RW than Rodrygo, it's not Saka nor Foden.  >I mean fuck Tchouameni might be the most overrated overpriced player on earth He's so overrated that is why about top 3-5 European clubs were after his signature in 2022 right?  Yeah sure , because Rice Lavia and Caicedo are way better right? Name one CDM better than Tchou who's also in his age group? There's no one, and the only one better than him last season were Rodri,Chaka and Hakan from Inter  >if I could swap Yildiz for Rodrygo I would say hell no,  Maybe that's why you aren't Juve's coach/ceo, so try using more than 2 brain cells (if you have them) It‚Äôs my opinion he should be higher considering enzo was bought for 120, not that hard to believe saka and foden could go for 140+ Right now it's haa;and but overall it's mbappe if he come backs from his slump(wich he should and seems to slowly) Overrated by Real Madrid fans, underrated by a lot of others though Me on the other hand find him completely underrated. WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING oh i know but many would argue that odegaard is a better player than saka, although on second thoughts maybe he‚Äôd be just outside top 10 Because England is a trash NT. He is not worth more than anybody on that list. Should be up there, any team would take him anyday City would sell Foden for 120m no questions asked.  Arsenal wouldn‚Äôt sniff at 200m for Saka. And ask any manager and of those 3 he will pick Pedri every time so how is he this season, i know hes scoring some goals but how does he play with the rest of the team? Because i know at least at tottenham he had to pull some voodoo shit to carry them in his last season.   does he fit in well? I agree. Foden is a classy player, but Saka rubs me the wrong way. Can‚Äôt quite tell why‚Ä¶ [deleted] The rumor is PSG offered 250mil for Yamal. Both guys here being satirical, we know it was a joke. What we going to do about it! For now, let‚Äôs preserve 180m peace. Chelsea, Man C,... Barca can't afford him. He is already in Real. I doubt he would go back to PSG under any condition. Maybe Man U, Arsenal and Lpool can pay that money. Man U and Arsenal cant buy because of FFP restrictions. Who else? United and Chelsea are only two clubs [deleted] Youre forgetting wages though. Those would be other 150 mil on top surely. If you play for the Big3-4 once you're valued that highly and command an associated transfer fee and wage, your options are severely limited unless you're willing to downgrade.  Where would Haaland go for example? There are like three highly conditional job openings for him at any time.  Who could sign Vini? yea something like that. paid over his duration of his contract It's actually 150m Euros to Mbappe, and roughly 40 million for agent fees. The total cost is 190\~ million.  That gets spread over his long contract though rather than in one go. It was a free transfer. His wages however... Not sure market value means that. I mean, that's just how prices work in general. Nothing is worth anything unless there's someone willing to pay for it A statistic showing the players who have the highest disparity in transfer value (adjusted for age) and FIFA score would be interesting. That‚Äôs not true. They use all kinds of data models and are known to be quite good. Obviously not perfect, but definitely quite good. bellingham is definitely worth more than musiala and wirtz, 2 poty awards at 2 different top 5 league at 20 Bellingham is better than these 2, plays for a bigger club and also is more hyped. All these things matter in a player valuation. Lol Sadly, Rodrygo is the first one that could be cut, specially if Vino wins the Ballon D'Or.¬†   That being said, a hurt Rodrygo playing as a LW while having something to prove is a really scary prospect for any team that might be interested üòÇ rodrygoat will retire martinelli in LW :/ Olmo plays as a 10 and is already injured The problem with Modric is that we decided to sign Fabregas instead, worst error in the last 15 years for us. Bar√ßa salary cap changed from 204M to 458M after last week LaLiga ffp review, it has been doubled. Bar√ßa is the third club in the world in revenue. You don't know what you are talking about. We don't have a crazy financial problem at all, we had a crazy FFP problem which was just resolved and La Liga adjusted our salary cap to where we are now 70 mil under it, without even being 1:1 which should happen as soon as the Nike deal is agreed, we should be completely stable within 2 years especially when the stadium remodelling is finished. Also there is an election next year and Laporta will probably be pressured to make a big signing, so Wirtz could be it. I don't see it though, but it is in the realm of possibilities. Odegaard plays right hough His hairline adds an extra 30M But he's not PL proven! No serious club would sign him [deleted] But the comment from the person you replied to doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ‚Ç¨120m is correct? Absolutely laughable to have Saka valued higher than Yamal lmao. Yamal is already better and much younger Or maybe you just need some patience, they don't update values every week and you also can't go from mister nobody to highest valued on the site in less than a year... thats only like 2 levers, they blow through that in one transfer window. Thats not a metric in transfermartk League performance over 5 years with 76 g/a in 158 matches lmao. While these are still great but if you've really followed la liga , he's far too inconsistent and these are not 180 mil level Also wingers are going to be more valuable if the players are of the same caliber and are equal in other metrics I feel like Vinnie's style won't let him stay on top as long as both Haaland and Jude. Real tax He has 25 goals in his last 59 league games... 48 in his last 158. Goldfish memory is a peak Gen Z thing okay people who think Jude is already on Zizou or Messi level are high af No sane person thinks he‚Äôs zidane or Messi level. Some many people think he‚Äôs overrated he‚Äôs almost underrated >There's a huge chunk of people that think Jude is already Zidane or Messi.  No there isnt? I consume a shit ton of fooball media, theres not really anyone saying that. Only comparisons ive heard are with zidane because 1. the way he moves can be reminiscent, and 2. Hes had some magical games for madrid, but thats in no way saying that hes reached his level. What do you mean he was nowhere in the second half of the season? He played a good second half of the season, it‚Äôs just that his role changed and didn‚Äôt score as much In la liga he started two games as striker, and tf you mean no where? Just because he doesn‚Äôt score or assists doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt play well. Haaland was nowhere to be found in the CL knockout stages or the big games in the league, he can bully weak & decent teams but when he faces the good ones he ghosts  & Jude was quite injured the 2nd half of the season & missed a lot of games due to that, yet he still finished the year with almost 40 goals involvements. Thats pretty good for a 20yo who played the whole season out of position Lmao. City have and can win titles easily with a false 9. Jude was the glue that made the team work last year and was Man of the match in the only good match we had this year, he's irreplaceable. Not really. If anybody asks out of City they get their wish, and nobody plays every match for City What their current club evaluates them at shouldn't change the market value.  My phone being worth 500‚Ç¨ to me doesn't change that its market value is 250‚Ç¨. Bruh why you getting downvote for your opinion Definitely barella, bastoni di Marco. Why?  Only Germans can properly rate players? If he looked like Bellingham, he honestly probably would. Not according to https://www.transfermarkt.us/spieler-statistik/wertvollstespieler/marktwertetop/mw Absolutely not lmao Not with that hairline¬† lol no he's not lmao what are you on mate? Yamal has 7 goal contributions in 5 appearances this season.  Saka has 5 in 4.  Yamal has a Euros.  And Saka has an FA Cup.  Saka is obviously clear. Saka is very good but Yamal is much better You won‚Äôt find a single City fan who will say Haaland was better than Foden last season. Rodri was probably better tbf but think people are pushing him for Bdor because he won the Euros as well Rodri ghosts in important matches... The guy who scored last year's ucl winner (as a defensive midfielder) ghosts in big games... Fair enough His output is overrated but his profile is underrated. At left wing he could be top 5ish probably. He‚Äôs just unlucky that 2/3 of the best LWs in the world are also at his club I think that his nation holds him back + offensive players get more pr (rodri gets anti pr, he's the ""underrated"" pick, so he gets a pass) I know but it's attacking player's world right now.... Nobody cares about defence or deep midfield players....   Rodri was putting these kind of performances on a weekly basis but he became a bigger star once he started scoring from time to time... Now people see how & what he does in midfield.... Because your rotation for Saka is weak. City can likely replace foden and be fine with it. It's more about wants and needs that it is about cold value City is in desperate need of money rather than being a semblance of a real club in this alternate universe? There's a good chance managers will pick many players above all these 10 players in their team depending on the manager... That doesn't change what the current market value of the player is....   Like if I were Madrid's manager the first player to start for me would be Valverde and maybe also Camavinga the 2nd name He fits well, he can make plays, and he can score loads of goals, but I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs rarely a difference maker in important matches. If Bayern plays well, he‚Äôll play well, if Bayern don‚Äôt play well he‚Äôll probably have a bad game. He‚Äôs still a top 10 player in the world imo. Why are you getting in such a pissy over someone's market value, go check tranfrmarket, yeah valuation is only as much as someone is willing to pay for a player but he's old, he's not going for ‚Ç¨100m+ I know Barca see him as their next big thing but with their finances I'm surprised they didn't take that offer to be honest.   Obviously we all know how poorly they spend but if they had some sensible recruitment in place those sort of funds could turn their club around. sure they did Barca would snap their hand off for that. There's no way it's true. Don't think we're in a very tight spot with FFP after this summer Whats the worst the FFP can do to you? If it means getting mbappe then i don't think a 10-15 points deduction will be enough to deter most, if any club. So it has to be getting banned from UCL for couple years or relegation to stop those teams risking it all for him Bayern. Bayern. Newcastle maybe? The only way Chelsea or City could afford Mbappe would be by selling off players to bring in money first. The FFP situation wouldn't support that kind of spending, Man City are already in hot water with the 115 charges without adding even more to the list with a 180 million signing. Not with our PSR restrictions. But there's another club in Manchester that would pay that. Can't imagine why you didn't list them If Liverpool were even considering bidding 100 for Caicedo they wouldn't give spending 180 on Mbappe a second thought Lol we were never ever close to signing him. Even if mbappe said he would want to, I doubt FSG would fork up the cash required to sign him. [All reliable Tier 1 sources agree it was more than 100M and less than 150M for the entire package.](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1axy2fo/fabrizio_romano_mbappe_numbers_signing_fee/) He is talking about the signing fee, not the transfer fee bro He got a huge signing fee, over 100m Difference is the opinion of the buying and selling club are the only ones that matter, not the transfermarkt algorithm which is honestly dreadful. Go look at any big club and 90% of the valuations are way off. And yet people continue to post them here like they mean anything. Price of most goods and services will he based upon costs of labour and materials or capital. Price of footballers is based solely on scarcity and speculative ROI. More in common with stock prices than price of bread. If it's that scientific then I'd wonder 1) why the top 4 all happen to have the same value and 2) why so many of their values are multiples of 10 million.   Fact is you'd probably get the same or similar results by strawpoll. Has to be a joke right? As long as I remember febregas wasn‚Äôt that bad of a signing and calling it the biggest error is straight up outrageous especially when Coutinho and dembele have played for this club Coutinho entered the chat Yes but if you slot Wirtz in at left 8 and play them both the midfield gets overrun, Arsenal have tried players like Smith Rowe and Trossard there and it hasn‚Äôt worked, and despite Wirtz obviously being a better asset going forward than those two I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be enough to offset the clear defensive vulnerabilities of that midfield 3  And even if you do think Wirtz is better than √òdegaard (a fair opinion, even though I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs there *yet*), there is no way the gap between them is so big as to make Wirtz a worthwhile signing given how much he‚Äôd cost Big package adds 20m I think teams just know there's no point in trying with him, some players are just off limits. They've *been* offered 250, and they didn't blink. LMFAO this is ridiculous Alright calm down and get Yamals dick from out your mouth, he is good no doubt about it but Saka is fast becoming one of the most underrated players out there thanks to people like you I guess not on transfermartk but irl it sure is I mean he is a LW and Haaland is a striker whose sole purpose is to score, while Vini is much more involved in creating, and creating doesn't only mean giving a pass to a teammate, this teammate dribbles past an opponent and scores and we will count that as an assist even tho it had no real impact.  Comparing Haaland and Vini based on g/A is just plain wrong. Ok, he is not worth 180m. He's still the best winger in the world, the best CL player, and has scored 0.18 fewer goals per 90 over the last year compared to Haaland while having 0.16 more assists (meaning Haaland has contributed to 1 more goal every 50 games). Happy? He also leads **ALL** UCL players since 2021 in Goals + Assists, Chances Created, Successful Dribbles, Ground duels, Fouls Won etc  Pretty much every single offensive category for all UCL players.  He has like 23 G+A in his last 22 UCL KO matches, essentially, he's always there when Madrid has an actual important fixture. And? He's a winger.  Haaland is practically useless without players providing him with opportunities. He has disappeared or played poorly in most CL QF, SF and Final games. Vini offers more. By that logic Rodri is worthless. You say that, but you'd have to hand wave a real chunk of people, plus actual sports journalists. I've seen some insane quotes on there, and it's not uncommon. He's definitely already in the conversation in a lot of circles. It is what it is.  Anyway, he's a bit overrated in my eyes, while still being world class. Too much too soon. out of position lmao If you took Haaland out of this current City team they don‚Äôt win the league Are you seriously using that to justify that Jude is more valuable than Haaland? Jude won a bunch of games for you guys last season when you didn't have elite finishers... almost as a 2nd striker. With Vini and Mbappe there now Jude is just an elite attacking mid. Haaland on the other hand is the best striker in the world and City is ass without him. Except your phone is not a unique item, it can be bought from multiple actors in the market. If anybody wants a Foden, they HAVE to buy it from City If your phone was a limited edition unique item which you only possess, the value of it won't be the market value. He‚Äôs getting downvoted for a really bad take. I‚Äôm sure Musiala can dribble well and work in tight spaces(idk, don‚Äôt watch Bayern). Wirtz, Vini and Foden have shown they can win games by themselves. Musiala was must have been changing tires when Leverkusen spread Bayern apart cause he was nowhere to be found. They are great (I'm a barella dickrider in particular) but they still aren't top ten Imo. They are around top 30 imo It‚Äôs about English Media which is hyping every English player. Have a look a the pre game analysis before the match England Germany in the WC 2010. So not according to the same source as this post. Thanks for clearing that up for us all. How many times have you watched Yamal lmao If yamal gets 25 g/a in only la Liga like Saka has in each of the last 2 PL seasons, or gets 8 g/a in 9 appearances like Saka did in his debut CL season then we can have convos until then Saka clears him¬† Mustafi has a World Cup   Mustafi > Van Dijk, John terry, rio Ferdinand.   This is fun.   Yamal has a higher ceiling than Saka but let‚Äôs not compare team achievements as justifications for why one player is better than another. It‚Äôs so lazy when you could actually speak about player profiles and abilities. So you‚Äôre judging Saka and Yamal off 5 and 4 appearances respectively, where the difference is only 2 g/a? Saka has 50 g/a in the last 2 seasons in only the PL, and had one of the highest g/a in the CL last season despite being knocked out in the quarters finals. He also has been one of englands best players in the last 3 years reaching 2 euros finals.  Yamal should probably be valued higher because of his age but Saka is definitely the better player currently¬† Because transfer market valuations are based on the same size of 5 appearances. What are you smoking over there? Lucky fluke of a goal, look at his ratings in this year's UCL knockout and euro knockouts That‚Äôs a very fair take Yep if he gets sold he will truly shine (assuming they don't play him rw too). yeah you‚Äôre right here, i agree Yeah? So then you‚Äôre validating my original point. Selling Yamal would mean losing the next presidency and almost giving our identity. Laporte got away with not renewing Messi, but selling Yamal would become much bigger than that. Supporters and socios would probably riot in the streets if Laporta sold Yamal. His presidency of the club would of course be dommed immediately.  And no matter how dysfunctional Barca seem to be, Yamal is certainly at the right place. Under a manager who should help him further.  PSG play in a poorer league and are often plagued with issues themselves, on and off the field. Not really a desirable place for a prodigy like him. They wouldn't do it because that's exactly what messed up the club in the first place. They sold Neymar for a hefty sum of 222m and then wasted even more money on wrong players. Also, it would make you very unpopular among fans for selling the best La Masia attacker after Messi. If they had a private ownership, I think they might have sold him. But, since presidents are elected, you have to be careful with your decisions. ""but with their finances I'm surprised they didn't take that offer to be honest""  Maybe 250M is not such a good operation for a player with the potential to become a franchise player and top 3 in the world for the next 15-20 years.   Barca's finances aren't at their best, but it doesn't mean the club's on the brink of bankruptcy to have to sell their best future asset. They have more levers to pull, haha Why is that hard to believe? He is the best player ever for his age, already one of the best in the world at 17 and with insane growth potential. Not to mention that it would mean getting one iver Barca which seems something that PSG are obsessed with  Yamal is definitely worth 250M in this market Think we actually made more money then spent so yea we‚Äôre pretty good It is not just this summer, we spent quite some in previous transfer windows and our sales were poor. We had to panic sell two players on ""PSR deadline day"", in what world could we fork out 180m for Mbappe lol. Rich owners doesn't really mean that much in the era of PSR. Not sure Wigan would count, mate. That's like saying Watford are a London club do you know, I'm not sure we would. Haaland and Mbappe sounds amazing on paper but I'm not sure how well it would work. Bellingham we were definitely in for OTOH.  EDIT: ok in fairness it looks like we did have at least some interest:  [https://www.eurosport.com/football/transfers/2023-2024/manchester-city-meet-kylian-mbappe-representatives-marcus-rashford-on-paris-saint-germains-shortlist\_sto10030357/story.shtml](https://www.eurosport.com/football/transfers/2023-2024/manchester-city-meet-kylian-mbappe-representatives-marcus-rashford-on-paris-saint-germains-shortlist_sto10030357/story.shtml) It‚Äôs been reported that John Henry & FSG were obsessed with Mbappe and would have sanctioned any fee if we actually had a chance of signing him. You‚Äôre 100% right. Right, player signing on fee.  >Fabrizio Romano: ""Signing on fee for Kylian Mbapp√© will be¬†*more than ‚Ç¨100m*. Signing fee will be paid over 5 years. It will be less than ‚Ç¨150m. Salary in same range of Vini Jr.""  So the signing on fee which is paid to Mbappe will be 150 million at most. But what about agent fees..? That can't be ignored as part of the cost because Real Madrid are the ones who had to pay it. It's like with pieces of art that are often also estimated by uninvolved third parties. It's really not that strange.  Are they perfect? Of course not, I never said so to begin with Go to the top sales of the summer on Transfermarkt and you‚Äôll see that pretty consistently their valuation at time of purchase is  pretty close to what players actually go for, even if there are plenty of deviations.  Telling you man, lots of professional clubs around the world use Transfermarkt. Not clubs that have millions to throw around at scouts, but for clubs that are at the early professional stages it‚Äôs considered an extremely valuable resource. It's not an algorithm. Every valuation from Transfermarkt is made by actual people. Not saying that this makes it better or worse, but there's no computer model behind those values. > will he based upon costs of labour and materials or capital  nobody cares about how expensive it is to make something if it's something that nobody is interested in. How much people are willing to pay for something is *always* the most important factor. This is true for both bread and stocks.  To drive this point home, it's not like every brand of bread has the exact same margins. Instead, the cheapest bread will likely have the smallest margins while the ""artisinal"" bread will be much cheaper to produce than the price indicates. And why is that? because every price you see is always just the price somebody assigned to it based on market analysis, nothing more and nothing less. I mean, not signing Modric and let him go to Madrid Yeah. A legitimate potential heir to Barcelona's 10 is priceless. And he's from Barcelona, no less. The kid is one of the best players in the world at 17, already proven that he can perform in the most high pressure situations and with insane potential to grow  He's a freak, the best 17 year old ever probably. If you think that's ridiculous it is down to your ignorance not having seen him play Saka *underrated*?? Only an Arsenal fan could come with that take Lmao what a braindead take. Lamine is worth 10 times what Saka is worth, only an Arsenal fan would think otherwise Ik what you mean and you‚Äôre both right, but transfermarkt isn‚Äôt just a random sites for idiots like us. It‚Äôs well documented that it‚Äôs the main search/evaluation engine in the football industry, clubs relies mostly to this site for these infos.   I think we should appreciate it, the fact that such cool site with useful infos and stats is free for anyone is awesome when most of these informations nowadays in big industries are behind paywalls/subscriptions Of course I think mbappe is still a better winger than vini and just a better player overall and that's why he's getting played out of position because vini would probably never work except on the lw I mean, sure and vini is the best winger right now‚Ä¶but also last years was famously Harland‚Äôs worst season in like 5 years wich also matters in this context Pretty much ever single category except one pretty important one.. which is that one? Haaland has proved he will be a topscorer no matter the team or league. Nobody can finish like him. Vini offers more of, what, exactly? He's pretty piss poor for Brazil and you seem to be relying on about 3 games a season to make a point. No, Rodri isn't an offensive player whose main duty is provide goals/assists. rodri is a dm not an attacker? He's a midfielder? & you said he played as a striker so what does that mean to you lmao? This is a wild take considering the last season they played without Haaland they won the league on 93 points with a front line of Gabriel Jesus/Mahrez/one of Sterling or Grealish. Their only close competition that year was Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool and now is likely only Arteta‚Äôs Arsenal (tbd on Slot‚Äôs Liverpool).           Just because they have no other traditional striker doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt function and score freely with some combo of Foden/Silva/De Bruyne/Bobb/Doku/Gundo/Grealish/Savinho/Rodri. That‚Äôs the most hilariously stupid thing I‚Äôve read and I don‚Äôt like city at all. City won multiple titles in a row without Haaland and the only specific title they won with him is the UCL which while a very big deal, he‚Äôs ghosted every single semifinal or final game with them so he‚Äôs not truly contributed against the top teams when it matters like previous world class players. There‚Äôs not a single person at city other than Pep who‚Äôs irreplaceable. You didn't mention value? You claimed Jude is not as important as us as Haaland is for City which is ridiculous. Since when is City ass without Haaland? Do you have any stats that back you up? But isn't that his opinion at the end of the day and he is not forcing it upon i guess we haven't seen the euros at all I think there are some overrated players on this list that barella is better than imo Bastoni and Di Marco are both world class in their positions. And German media are hyping every German player?  That was almost 15 years ago mate, and what analysis?   What is ‚ÄòTHE‚Äô pre game analysis? lol, did you even check? Both sources are from Transfermarkt like every match in the Euros and a bunch of Barca matches. Saka is a great player but Yamal is a generational talent Enough to know his spelling right So, he has 33 matches to get 18 g/a? That's easier than stealing from a baby You‚Äôre missing the original point.  It‚Äôs not about who is the ‚Äúbetter player‚Äù but who is ‚Äúperforming better‚Äù RIGHT NOW.  And right now Yamal is.  He‚Äôs coming off of a better Euros and a slightly better league form. not that i care but probably looking at their age too. even i can tell at his age that lamine is class >doesn't have big moments: ghosts  >does have big moments: fluke They will break into laporta's office if he sells him and set the stadium on fire. Don't underestimate Laporta. He managed to let Messi go with little to no consequence to his presidency. He can similarly sell Yamal or anyone else fwiw if he thinks the club needs it. Despite everything, he's actually a shrewd politician. And with his stock being currently quite high with the socis he has some leeway to do something weird again. 17 yo Pele won the world cup. Scored a brace in the final. Yamal's good, but.. best 17 yo ever? It's probably not in the ""180m on a single player"" range no but I'd be surprised if we're hindered very much by FFP next summer That's where the maybe? kicks in. If you'd get the PSR sorted out you'd certainly have the funds.¬† Lol you 100% would, they would be incredible together. Even forgetting that  the marketing opportunity of having the two of them is hard to pass up. Mbappe's favourite position was coming in from the left flank rather than through the middle. He plays his best football on that side as he gets ball to feet more  often and can use his pace a bit more from a wide position.  I think if money wasn't an issue, City would get him. With the PSR situation it doesn't make sense to spend 180 million + on one player. Even with the Alvarez sale, more money needs to be brought in with player sales to give that the green light. Wasn't a deal basically agreed a year or two ago? No, that's the point his signing on fee includes everything but his official salary. I didn't say he was underrated. I said he was BECOMING underrated.  For a man that consistently gets goals and assists for his club, the best player for his country, all the while being double or triple marked he always seems to have his ability looked down on.  Yamal right now is not as good as Saka. Simple as. Transfermarkt valuations are primarily decided by community discussions between a handful of people and are easily manipulated. Utter, utter bullshit. It's a very useful website. Been using it since 2014 around the time they redesigned it. however, if contract length/pay is not a metric used to evaluate a players price in the market then the evaluation means very little imo.   If Haaland extendes tomorrow for 3 more years and better pay his value should go up. That's how it works irl... It wasn't Vini's best season either, he got injured multiple times and took a few games to get back into shape. He's a winger not a striker.  The fact he has more goal contributions from the wing than everyone else on any other position is more than good enough. [deleted] It's good that he can't transfer national teams.   He creates a ton more and progresses the ball. He's the best touchline LW in the world and always turns up for big games (for club atleast). I mean just look at his Champions League stats. These transfer values are pretty arbitrary anyway considering there isn't really a unified framework behind them so discussing the details is pretty pointless. that's as educated as saying ""Messi played out of position because he's a right winger not a 10""  jude never played as a midfielder for Madrid and any heatmap/avg position will tell you that. he's an egotistic asshole who was hated in Dortmund's dressing room for his antics, and now he found his place among the rest of the egotistic asshats.   But he's a Barca fan (as most of Madrid's top players who aren't criminals) so that's nice. You think Haaland was worth less than 2 points to City last year? Even Real Madrid won titles before Jude. It is, downvoting him is also a way to voice OUR opinion. Our opinion is that his opinion is shit. Downvoting is a valid way to disagree with someone. Doesn‚Äôt really hurt anyone.   I can also get downvoted for my opinions.   Modric > Xavi and Iniesta  Barca & Spain fans will be quick to downvote this take. I watched Germany get beat by Spain until Wirtz came on to tie the game.   I watched Bellingham bail southgate and England from an early exit.  I‚Äôm not arguing that Musiala is a bad player. I‚Äôm just arguing that that the others have shown to have that X factor that turns games around. Difference is, one of those two leagues has way more influence overseas compared to the other and also operates in the most talked language itw. That was literally my point....? So you‚Äôve watched him about 5-6 times max?   Being so confident that yamal is better is crazy considering you could only argue that since the euros. Saka was 1 goal short in the champions league alone than Yamal‚Äôs total career goals until the euros. Let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves here.  Sure, yamal very possibly is a generational talent and will be miles better than Saka, but it‚Äôs definitely not the case now. I also find it hard to believe that you watch ‚ÄòBarcelona a bunch‚Äô. RemindMe! 9 months¬† No one is debating that either. The debate was about the valuation versus the sample size so far.  Messi, in 2004 or 2005, was not worth more than Ronaldinho(in pure valuation) in his prime despite his potential.  Unless Lamine has 1 proper season where he hits world-class numbers, it's not right to compare him to players who have had 2+ years of top-quality seasons.  Last season he was good but nothing outlandish. This season he's started great but that alone doesn't warrant a base. But I never said that yamal should be valued lower. I‚Äôm just saying saka‚Äôs currently the better player¬† He didn't ""let Messi go"" him staying was never an option he just kept up the charade to humour the fans 16 year old Yamal won the Euros(the final being one day after his 17th birthday) as a key player and the level of football today is much much higher can't even compare  You can stick your head in the sand all you want but Yamal is that good I guess, but we'll need to dramatically increase revenue to really get PSR ""sorted"". Our wage structure definitely wouldn't suit Mbappe either It's more like Mbappe's wages are absolutely crazy and he isn't exactly a perfect fit for Pep's systems. Also would probably expect to play every game Not sure tbh. There was definitely talks but how far along they got, who knows. It always felt like Mbappe was waiting for Madrid, but I‚Äôm sure he spoke to a few other clubs during that time. No, that's not how it works. A signing on fee is a one off bonus to the player as a part of his contract. In addition to his contracted wages.  The agent fee is a separate cost that gets paid to the agent, which has nothing to do with the player signing on fee. It's never grouped together because they are paid to different people. >Yamal right now is not as good as Saka. Simple as.  Again, only an Arsenal fan would think that. The only area where Saka is better is defensive discipline  Yamal better dribbling, better passing, better crossing. And his shooting is improving very rapidly They don‚Äôt account for contract length because it‚Äôs a relative metric, players with 1 year or less left of contract would‚Äôve a value at 0, especially those at 6 months or less when the transfer window is closed.   It would be awful if they account that, half the players would‚Äôve half the value and lot of 0s for these mentioned above.   Not to mention the biggest factor, hence that is easy to calculate a player value by contextualization of the contract length; if a player is worth 90mil but has 0 years left, such as Mbappe last year, it‚Äôs easy to assume the value because its none. In the opposite, if Mbappe was set at 0, how would you make a valuation of the player when you have 0 infos about it and It‚Äôs clear as day that this is the best way and also the reason why it is like that, not because they forgot something or never thought about it Totally more than good enough! I agree. Someone mad they didnt include haaland in their fantasy team. He's the best ~touchline~ LW in the world  ftfy >that's as educated as saying ""Messi played out of position because he's a right winger not a 10  Using Messi who is an anomaly in football as an example lmao, & he's a forward lol, thats were he played  most of his career, in the frontline. Jude been a midfielder in Dortmund & England & now he's back to that at RM  >. he's an egotistic asshole who was hated in Dortmund's dressing room for his antics, and now he found his place among the rest of the egotistic asshats. But he's a Barca fan (as most of Madrid's top players who aren't criminals) so that's nice.   Average 9yo Bar√ßa nephew comment >and any heatmap/avg position will tell you that. he's an   Blud really looked at the heat map and decided to be oblivious. Tough to say considering he‚Äôs such a good player, yet their point totals the last two seasons have been lower than the season before his arrival.           Point is, Pep has an incredible roster even without him, and I trust him to find solutions that keep City humming even in Haaland‚Äôs absence. I‚Äôm not disputing that. I‚Äôm disputing the statement that City are ass without Haaland, there is not a single player at City without whom the club doesn‚Äôt function. There was Rodri last season but Pep has fixed even that. That's because we had balon dor Benzema , jude came in and madrid never felt his absence , he was that Good last season Bruh wtf are you talking smh bro just stated his opinion and here you are acting like you are been oppressed and where did barca comes from smh real madrid fans are so insecure Aha. So Germany's best player throughout the euros, and the one where's Spain entire strategy in stopping him was fouling him is not an impact player. Also acting like it was just Wirtz coming on to tie the game, when it was in reality more Sane coming off because he was useless the entire tournament is really disingenuous   >I watched Bellingham bail southgate and England from an early exit.  Also are we seriously using a fluke goal to try to act like Bellingham had a good euros? He was abysmal for 90% of the tournament. nope, probably closer to 15-20 times  it's definitely up for debate and not a closed case but Yamal has the most assists in 2024, he's been averaging something like an assist every 2 games so it isn't all about goals  idk why you find it hard to believe that I've watched Barca play, they play great football and are much more fun to watch than any teams outside of the big 6 in the PL RemindMe! 9 months Please do Iirc messi in 2004 and 2005 had barely played at all. Why are we comparing Ronaldinho worth who had won a Ballon d'or at that point in time here.  It'd be ridiculous to say Lamine is better than Vini (probably the Ballon d'or winner), but saka?   To me its purely age related why wasn‚Äôt it an option for the man wanting to play for free to stay? Yamal is incredible but he's not better than Pele come on. >and the level of football today is much much higher can't even compare  Then the best players of all time will always be those from the current generation, since health and sports science keep improving?  Just so you know how terrible your example is - Apply it to another constantly improving field like physics. Newton founded basis calculus centuries ago - Yet no one would dare pick a modern day physics whizz over him when there are conversations about the best physicist of all time. Yes the modern guy knows so much more - But the stuff Newton did was ground breaking.  If scoring at 17 in a world cup final was easy someone might have done it since. Yeah, wage structure is the big thing here and probably the actual reason why no other club would realistically go for him. The transfer fee would be very high but there are some clubs that could (and would imo) pay it, but they would not want to pay the enormous wages that he'd demand. Mbappe is a much better fit for peps system than doku. And haaland plays every game, so does rodri. World class players play every game for pep. The wages though I accept is a good point. Why are you making the assumption the value would be zero?   If anything when a KM type of player is a free agent irl his asking price is actually much higher because there's no transfer fees involved.  If the only thing being calculated is the possible transfer fee than the evaluation is even more useless.  Your value should go up with an extension (especially a long one) and go down approaching the last 6 months. No need for zeros .. just lower the value if bonuses are not met and performance does not drastically change. There's should never be three players with different contract lengths and pay sharing market value. Makes no sense! Seems you don‚Äôt get the point I was making. Never claimed to be oppressed. All I claimed was that downvoting is a valid form of disagreement and gave an example that would generate downvotes the quickest. How are you missing this? Dismissing the impact of Wirtz‚Äô goal by saying Sane was bad is a new type of argument I need to try.   I gave you these examples because you brought up the euros. I gave you 2 clear examples of Wirtz and Bellingham being impact players and you‚Äôre giving me excuses as to why your favorite impact player did not have an impact.  You seem to believe I‚Äôm calling Musiala bad here. I can assure you that is not the case. That's not the point either.   Messi was rated higher than Yamal back then and had great performances in 2005 and people were predicting him to be better than Ronaldinho.  Yes, he had played fewer games but Yamal sample size isn't that great either.   He literally started his career last year.  Saka is world class and his numbers are up there with the best since 2022.   If Lamine has a great season, sure the valuations will improve substantially but after 5 games to jump the gun and say 4-5 players are worth more than Lamine isn't objective. Ask La Liga rules or Tebas. They require a minimum salary based on what they were previously paid. This is the exact reason why we paid more to Felix than what was agreed with him and Atleti. Because it isn't allowed by the rules, there is a limit to how much a player can drop their salary Look at a football game from like 2006 and the difference is staggering. Teams are not compact and players have so much time on the ball  And that is not even 20 years ago, let alone fucking 1958  >Then the best players of all time will always be those from the current generation, since health and sports science keep improving?  Pretty much yeah, I hold Messi way higher than Pel√© for this reason Mbappe doesn‚Äôt come back to defend   That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs currently working on for Madrid   Don‚Äôt get me wrong he would 100% be welcomed by pep but it would be another grealish situation where he doesn‚Äôt get massive game time for 1 year then he becomes crucial to the team > Mbappe is a much better fit for peps system than doku.  More like Pep would find a way to make them work  > And haaland plays every game, so does rodri.  And with Ederson being nailed, there's only 8 positions left being contended by (realistically) 19 players. That's with players like Dias, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Foden, Gvardiol who are very hard to bench. Making it 19 for 7 positions is really bad From [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/transfermarkt-market-value-explained-how-is-it-determined-/view/news/385100):   Numerous factors - the most important are listed below - calculate market demand for a player. Demand is defined using a paid transfer fee and salary in the context of the individual and situational parameters outlined below. It should be noted that in bigger leagues there is a heavier focus on transfer fees, while in smaller leagues where there is a greater emphasis on free transfers, the focus is primarily on salaries to determine market values.   Our goal is to reflect the demand for the player and adjust for special factors/framework parameters in the medium term. At the same time, market values are viewed both individually and in comparison, to other players/clubs/leagues. A player with an expiring contract has a transfer value of zero, the market value, however, is calculated independently from his actual transfer value.   In this respect, even a short contract length can only be taken into account to a limited extent. The individual transfer modalities are also relevant in the case of a possible difference between market values and transfer fees. Never dismissed Wirtz's impact. What I am dismissing is that Wirtz alone changed everything htat game. No what changed was that Germany suddenly was playing with 11 men.  Also again, what was Spain's strategy against Musiala?  >Bellingham being impact players and you‚Äôre giving me excuses as to why your favorite impact player did not have an impact.  A fluke goal in the 94th minute of a game does not make Bellingham an impact player. What make shim an impact player is that he shows up for big games, which well he didn't because he ghosted in the UCL anyway >More like Pep would find a way to make them work  A front 3 of mbappe, haaland and bernardo absolutely slaps and any top manager would make it work.  >And with Ederson being nailed, there's only 8 positions left being contended by (realistically) 19 players. That's with players like Dias, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Foden, Gvardiol who are very hard to bench. Making it 19 for 7 positions is really bad  Then there qould be 7 positions. One of doku or grealish would absolutely be banished to the shadow realm by pep if mbappe were to be added to this city squad. Ok so they so take the contract length and pay in account. Good to know. Told you they should this I agree with, we could clear out other players to make room if we needed to"

There a few things I think I‚Äôd want to read less. I mean, I‚Äôve read it all here the last five fucking years. Mate... 7 years of waiting  Thank God it's over now a really cool story that i did not read approx. 15 times for the past seven years Nothing about this transfer was inside, and hidden away.  It played out in front of our very own eyes. He said he was going there. He didn‚Äôt. Then he did. Who gives a shit? Kind of feel like we've all been living it the whole way to be honest. An signs contract, man moves to new team. Massive story that. THANK GOD What's next, an ibai vlog of 'insider knowledge'? Had a feeling this would make the times lmao Catalan demanding a new league Cmon man city oil up, pump up those numbers make UCL entertaining atleast before Pep leaves *much more in-depth article about him signing with Real Madrid* edit:use reader on iPhone/apple to read this for free Arsenal can beat them /r/savedyouaclick Genuinely depressing but anyone not named Madrid get hates for this stacked team, not meatriding, everyone is all for this when it comes to daddy Madrid. Saga maybe over but get ready to the daily 10-12 ‚ÄúKylian Mbappes first days in Madrid‚Äù until the new season That must've been incredibly difficult. You waited 3 years for Hazard I don't feel any happiness from it. Only an exacerbated finally I don't have to deal with this shitty saga anymore. Arsenal fans try not to bring up city is like asking a duck to not beg for bread. Anyone can beat them since football isn't decided before the game is played.  But it's just going to be more difficult since they are now more complete. needed pens to beat a porto team that fired its manager and lost to the worst bayern side in ages who also fired its manager We're not exactly strangers to being hated or playing the role of the villain, but unless I'm reading this wrong, you're implicating that we've built our team via unfair sporting or monetary advantages, otherwise, I can't find a single reason why you would think the hate would be fully justified. In which case, perhaps it would be wiser to direct your hate at the right targets, like the oil clubs. Ironically, the OG state-backed club. I do have a soft spot for them though but I see your point.¬† It's because they don't break FFP unlike the saudi clubs I get it, it‚Äôs tough seeing your club go from legendary to a joke, especially when you see your European rivals thriving while you‚Äôre getting spanked over and over again by your Italian rivals. Even then, plenty of neutrals will feel pity for you and openly pray for your success because that‚Äôs how good you used to be. Make no mistake though, it‚Äôs not Real Madrid standing in the way of your success: it‚Äôs yourselves. And the monthly ""There is only room for one superstar at Madrid, sparks fly as Mbappe refuses to pass ball to Vinicius"" articles 'EXCLUSIVE: Kylian Mbappe's first visit to a Mercadona supermarket, full inside story here' Bread is actually bad for ducks. Don't feed ducks bread! Especially American bread We already know we are not winning champions league in this lifetime especially with THAT madrid squad might as well support the enemy of my enemy in terms of watching entertaining champions league match of current superstars between haaland and mbappe together with bellingham, vini jr, foden and co. Bayern might have had a bad season, but they are still a very good team. They wouldn't have made it to the semi-finals otherwise Posted from Wyoming I assume? Pipe down yank You sound like a massive gimp I can hear Marca and Mundo Deportivo already typing these headlines Fucking hell  Can't wait for Mbappe not hugging Vini after he scores That was more down to Benzema being an outright prick. Also, add the monthly rodrygo leaving news, dissent by guler and endrick due to lack of game time. That's so stupid, CL is a knockout competition and can be won by anyone, the true best team doesn't actually win half the time because of how the format is, it's two matches and anything can happen in that I mean, you are not winning the UCL but don't blame it on us. We've played only once and you eliminated us They made it to the semi finals because they had a cupcake group stage and drew Lazio in the r16. The only good team they beat *was* Arsenal.  Arsenal still have a ton to prove in Europe. Arteta's not beaten a single high level side on the continent. Yee-hawla Madrid Oh 100%. Doubt they could point to Spain on a map. in hindsight, I can not believe that was a thing. it became such a thing that you'd see bale or cristiano going out of their way to hug each other solely to stop the nonsense. lol ridiculous I mean, it is quite difficult to do that when this is your first season back in the CL, but I do see your points Hey to be fair to us I don't think apart from city and maybe dortmund, no other team would have beat us"

Time to learn Arabic buddy Shankland rejected nominative determinism. Stop promoting him! We want to keep him, wtf are you doing? 49 in 35, what the fuck Harry? Cool to see Lawrence on here! Sent him a DM in like 2017/18 when he was blasting in L1 with Ayr. Nice guy LAWRENCE SHANKLAND IS KING üá±üáªüëë This list is missing the actual star of the season: Paulinho üòç [deleted] Shankland ready to terrorise Germany at the Euros in a few months. Auba and luuk de goat. Barcelona influence. Gyokeres and Roger Schmidt are the two absolute jewels of Portuguese League right now.  Please some top team get them both so my team can be champion next season. Not one la Liga player here. The attacking talent in Spain has fallen off a cliff in recent years How is a man called Shankland not a player in London? Icardi's assist game is really underrated this year. Even when he couldn't connect goals the guy contributed. I can't wait for this guy and Amorim to leave Sporting this summer I might start believing Kane is actually cursed. Icardi is having a meh season and nursing an injury the last 2-3 months btw. This is him at 50%. Absolute monster. Big up oliver. Darwin has 32 so far as well. Just wanted to mention it because I am in love with him. [SOURCE: TRANSFERMARKT](https://www.transfermarkt.pt/)  [INSTAGRAM POST](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4qmx3RuS9R/?igsh=MTN4MnJwYm5pOGhpdw==) considering that Icardi spent half of this season being injured and insisted on playing anyway, this is still very impressive to me. In hindsight we should've forced him to rest but the guy insisted on playing and played with injections. I wonder how his performance would've changed if he had skipped a month to heal and come back at 100% instead of playing at 40-60% for half a year. luuk holy hell, guess la liga wasn‚Äôt for him Icardi after getting hurt in the Besiktas game back in October ‚Äò23 had a super subpar series of games. We played him while shooting him up with pain killers, according to the club doctor. In hindsight, not the best move, but he does a great job of keeping defenders busy. He‚Äôs often drawing  defenders towards him, but unfortunately the supporting cast around him have been sloppy with their first control, passes, etc. this year.   There is a night and day difference between Kerem Akturkoglu‚Äôs and Icardi‚Äôs chemistry when you compare this season with last.   But with all this being said, not too shabby to see 34 g/a in 38 games. Gy√∂keres price tag just increase to 100 mil. Boehly problably wants to sign him Salah should have so many more assists this season. Icardi ripping it up. We made it boys Gy√∂kerias um ? Levas dois ! So is Gy√∂keres juicing or did he hit an insane development patch at Sporting? Damn Auba, what a comeback! Happy for him Shankland lol, what an amazing name AUBAAA Auba bounced back from washed to good for the 3rd time now. Aubaaaaaaaaaaaa yaanng yaaang Dang didn‚Äôt know aubameyang is going off like that Luuk de Goat is Top 4, of course. Luuk de Goat The most impressive thing about Kane‚Äôs stats are that all have come in the Bundelisga and Champions League whilst only having like 4/5 penalties. In comparison to Mbapp√© who has 9 penalties for PSG and 10 G/A in the Coupe De France (8 of the 10 against lower division teams). How competitive is the Eredivisie, really? It's odd to see players like Tadic move from Southampton to Ajax and then dramatically improve his output. Similarly, De Jong seems to be following the same path. Gy√∂keres is gonna be so god damn expensive man couldn‚Äôt all this social media pages do this advertising for him like 2 months ago instead of now?? Wow crazy how do you spell that name lol Mauro? The fuck? You'd never expect to see a player with the family name of Shankland on this list.  Just saying... ""Ollie Watkins do do do do do"" üé∂ üé∂ [deleted] Shankland sounds like a good call of duty gamer tag Doesn‚Äôt count ‚Äî bas dost had like 76 goals in 84 apps here too Another sporting lisbon player for man utd Shankland sounds like a british amusement park where you pay to get stabbed by people from Newcastle. Back in the day I think only goals were really counted, G+A measurements are fairly recent. The assists take them over, and a lot of forwards are more involved in the game than previously (top 3 for example likely get over 10 assists each this season). To be honest, I think its normal for the top 3 or 4 of players to manage that in a season. In this list, we can see 6. A little bit more, but most players tend to slow down towards the end of the season because of fatigue and such... so maybe this 6 will reduce only to Haaland, Gy√∂keres, Kane, Mbappe and De Jong. There are 6 players with > 1 G+A/played games  MSN 15/16-  Messi 48 games 65 G+A  Suarez 52 games 85 G+A  Neymar 48 games 57 G+A A lot of times these lists only include the top five leagues so that could play a part too. There are way more goals per game these days basically across the board. Football has become more concentrated at the top, easier to stat pad. Because football has declined. What do you think of Beto? Emery is some kinda striker whisperer. Every where he goes, his STs numbers go nuts - David Villa, Soldado, Bacca, Gameiro, Cavani, Laca, Auba, Moreno, Watkins all scored insane amounts of goals under him.   Obviously a lot of these players are good anyway, but he has a knack of getting the best out of STs not only numbers wise either, performance wise as well. Watkins is underrated. He has been quality for some time, but this season... even better He's just a shit Luuk De Jong Bang average player. I think City should sell him to us for 30m Without that Luton game he wouldn‚Äôt even be on the list lol. Been injured a fair bit but defo a down season for his standards Spoken like someone who hasn't seen him take a penalty Everyone knows about him already. √â hora de aumentar a cl√°usula hahah ou achas que os clubes grandes v√™m fazer scouting no Reddit üòÇüòÇ Kane is a monster. His numbers this season are insane ""Yer a striker, Harry!"" Just wonder what he could do with a 5 years younger  Mueller. Kane not moving to a different club sooner might be one of the biggest regrets I‚Äôve ever seen.   He‚Äôs always been world class for years now, shame he‚Äôs a few years of retirement. You can DM Messi too. Point is, did he reply? Gyokeres might have scored more but the one who steals the show every game! Ricardo esgaio, everyone, round of applause! And esgaio, has 60 assists to the assister Was gonna say auba was putting up some impressive numbers. Seems like he found his grooves again. Your team is Benfica, right? Premier League teams will forever regret not scouting him out when he was at Coventry. I hope Arsenal do manage to get him. I just checked.  Jude Bellingham - 29 G/A Lewa - 26 G/A Griezmann - 26 G/A Vini - 24 G/A Morata - 22 G/A   Jude looked like a contender in the very beginning of the season, but his numbers now are very far away from the top of this list. He has slowed down his numbers very dramatically. Which is to be expected since he isnt a striker tbf to him. It always was considering you had arguably the two best attacking trios of all time going head to head.  In general I'd argue the attacking talent isn't as prolific as it used to be (even taking out Messi / Ronaldo). You had way more prolific strikers during that period. I think there's still a fair bit of attacking talent. It's rather a cocktail of many factors IMO, including the play style. Teams are very cagey and very rarely play open football, even in games with slightly bloated scorelines.  Referees also allow a lot for the defenders but nothing for the attackers.  Plus this particular season, many of the usual suspects have suffered breaks in continuity. Not just the missed games, the stop start nature also breaks rhythm. As they say, availability is the best ability. Pfff vira essa boca para l√°! Lmfao¬† Me neither. Someone please sign vik..... Anyone Yeah. Those 2 to leave Sporting and Schmidt to leave Benfica. If it happens again next year sure. But Leverkusen is on an all-time run and Bayern is basically on an average season for then - which is usually enough. Plus Saarbrucken is goated and the UCL is not over. Has nothing to do with Kane and everything to do with Leverkusen being unbelievable People trashing Icardi in the match thread. Here you fucking go. This is Icardi. No touches with no service, but when he does get it, it‚Äôs done. What a season for him. Grown immensely under Unai. Seriously!?!?! God damn fair play to him He is magnetic. It has been 100M‚Ç¨ since he signed his contract for us. Doesn't make sense for us to sell him below his clause Icardi has slowed down a lot compared to the first 4 or 5 months of the season. He was on par with Gy√∂keres for some time but the distance has opened up quite a lot. De Jong has been far more consistent. He's having a bad season compared to last year even with those numbers He lit it up at Coventry as well. Carried them plenty of games [deleted] Do note that Kane is surrounded by many other world-class players at Bayern whereas Mbapp√© doesn‚Äôt have the same assistance. Also, Kane has scored at least 8 penalties this season, which is less than Mbapp√© but still considerable. Eredivisie bottom half teams aren't that great and good strikers can get a lot of GA. The tops teams are good quality and competitive though. It's also not like Tadic is a nobody, he showed up in the CL at Ajax and is still doing well in Turkey now. Same with De Jong, he is a top striker when you use his abilities and can live with limitations. He has 8 goals in the CL this season, although 5 were in the qualifiers. No way. His release clause is only ‚Ç¨100M and I can't imagine he'll be okay with increasing it. Unfortunately he won't be going for more than that. Gy√∂keres? Based on what he said to help us fans pronounce is something like ""I√≥keres"". The I would have an english ""e"" sound. Watkins is a special player man. Southgate will definitely NOT play him in the upcoming friendlies. He will ask Kane to play with his protective boot on. Wtf Bas Dost has over 250 career goals lol. You're making him sound like a bad striker... wtf  In the current season, Bas Dost still has 0.97 xG per 90 minutes, for example. And he is 34 now Well of course the goal merchant scored many goals. That's an obvious one Sporting CP* G+A has never been easier to track than it is today, that's for sure. Hes talking about recent seasons not 20yrs ago Back in the day there was Messi and Ronaldo with their insane goal stats, you didn't need to show assists to prove they were miles ahead of the rest. too many words to just say fuck you salah Those were the golden days man. There was almost never a day where we didn't have either MSN or CR7/Benzema on the frontpage with a world class goal I love him, he‚Äôs chaotic and you never know what he‚Äôll do next.  Though other fans aren‚Äôt as‚Ä¶forgiving as I am. Aubameyang and Lacazette were both great strikers before Emery I think he‚Äôs fairly rated at this point. He‚Äôs been getting plaudits from around Europe and people are paying attention. He‚Äôs a great player but he is still developing in some areas Arsenal fan here - we put forward a bid of ¬£30 million and ¬£1. *still league top scorer* He missed 3 in a row and hasn't taken them since right? Makes his goal-scoring record even better really. One season wonder, you can‚Äôt know for sure, next season he might be a flop.  (As a spurs fan this is what I‚Äôve been reading about Kane since 2013) I know what benzema would do with a 14yr old muller tho Tbf it‚Äôs not like he didn‚Äôt try to leave Yes, he did. I think I still have the screenshots of the messages at home. Sent him a insta msg to just say good luck that year. I had started a FM save that year with Ayr randomly and had never heard of him. But he performed nearly as well for me that year as he did for the club. He just said thanks and also good luck to me. Been following his career since! Very bad start of the season but extremely decisive since he picked his form What leaving Chelsea does to a MF Ofc Yeah he was massively over performing at the start, this was always going to happen He also got injured, so that didn't help much check again maybe cuz Bellingham and Lewandowski have exactly the same stats according to transfermarkt (20G + 9A) Vini played only 28 games this season and lost 11 due to injury. Had he played more, there are decent chances he would have made to the list. Back in the days where atletico had Falcao, no one even anywhere near that level now in la liga.¬† Weird statement coming from a Bayern Fan. just because the acronym BBC sounds cool does not mean one should place them ahead of Ribery,Robben-Lewa for example.  Also, both attacking trios were a thing for no more than three years, before Neymar left and Bale started getting benched. Hello there. Do you have a sell on clause? He was playing while being injured for about 2 to 3 months Injury That's fair. Yeah I guess so. Still not bad numbers though. Anyone who saw him playing last season would know he could do it, i dont really understand how he came to Sporting for like 25M or whatever it was, specially when a lot of ""top"" clubs were looking for strikers I would say just common sense He has 4 penalties, not 8. 3 in the Bundesliga and 1 in the Champions League.   Where did you get 8 from? I hope they won‚Äôt increase it to ‚Ç¨120m. But even if they don‚Äôt, you are gonna get some good money for him¬† Haha yeah, wouldn't surprise me.  Ollie has been improving year in year out, but since Unai Emery took over Villa he has become far more clinical. Ur actually completely right ‚Äî I am being a top 4 snob What happened to Lisbon? My wish is that pre-assists starts to be tracked and discussed more. Would be really nice to see a stat that highlights midfielders and defenders more. Even if its an offensive one. I dont mean it like that hahah What about Chermiti? Not sure why you're being downvoted, sure Emery had a good impact on them but both Aubam and Lacazette were racking in a shitload of goals in Bundes and Ligue1 before joining Arsenal He has already established himself as Kane's number one sub. I would love to say his next step should be the top 6- But Villa are part of the new top 6 anyway. Both him and Salah have missed a lot of games, but they're still sat there putting up brilliant numbers as usual. Shhhhh, remember, the narrative is supposed to be that he's washed and garbage this year He scored one recently in the Edinburgh derby. One of the hibs fans threw a pie at him which he caught and took a bite. Brilliant scenes If he wanted to he would have. We could have seen the man banging in goals like he has been all season for the last 4-5 years. Wow it's getting to a long list now, starting from Salah, KDB to Havertz, Pulisic maybe even Auba possibly now. Fair enough, with those two changes, you'd probably be champion this year already. I said this in the beginning. Was clear that defenders were still getting used to his style of attacking Damn, I used FutMob to be faster and it backfired üòÇ Transfermarkt isn't accurate data for assists. For example it gives assists for penalties won. You can argue that should count but it isn't used in official data (leagues usually go for Opta).   That being said, the post is based on transfermarkt data so for the sake of consistency, OP should have used them here too. You even had the likes of Griezmann on Real Sociedad Nowhere in his comment did he mention Bayern‚Äôs trio was inferior lol I think it‚Äôs 15% But he played roughly the same amount of games as everyone else. Is he playing while not recovering from an injury? From International football where he scored four additional penalties from four attempts. That‚Äôs not the topic of this post but I brought it up regardless. Honestly, I was yelling at the tv when he passed instead of scoring against spurs. Hahaha No problem mate, Sporting fans really liked Dost, he was amazing for us. It never happened haha. Sporting never had Lisbon in the name hahaha its like saying ""Arsenal London"" /u/thirdplanetperson over at /r/Galatasaray is our stats person and he keeps track of our players‚Äô ‚Äúhockey‚Äù assists. Good stuff and I totally agree, it should be kept as a legit stat for players.¬† Ice Hockey has it right imo. Primary assist for the player who passed to the scorer, secondary assist for the player who passed to the primary assister. And they count the same.   So goalies get assists on outlet passes frequently. My wish is winning penalties and last touches before own goals being counted as assists (assuming it was a cross or shot that led to the own goal). Alex Hleb would finally get his due.¬† Here‚Äôs the thing, they‚Äôve developed stuff to measure stats like xT and xA - which is effectively a far more complex way to measure the same thing. It tells you if a player‚Äôs actions often lead to a goal scoring chance. But it‚Äôs such an obtuse way of delivering that statistic to the audience because they can‚Äôt intrinsically know what that looks like on the pitch.   But if you said to someone ‚Äúoh X plays a lot of the passes before the pass to a goal‚Äù, then they know exactly what you mean because they could immediately visualise it happening. ‚ÄúPasses before pass that leads to a chance‚Äù or ‚Äúdribble before pass that leads to a chance‚Äù would also be effective (and interesting) for similar reasons.   But for some reason this isn‚Äôt a commonly tracked and published stat. Unlike stuff like xA it‚Äôs not listed on all the public stat websites. I know I‚Äôd be interested in seeing it on Fbref or on the PL website. It‚Äôs not like it would be particularly hard to count or anything. Just seems weird that they don‚Äôt https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/BoWsySWegt MLS does something like this, although the ""hockey assists"" get lumped together with regular assists. No Wouldn‚Äôt that just be the number of successful passes or pass accuracy? He‚Äôs played roughly 114 seconds in the first team ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ Because Reddit vibes, innit? [deleted] No one is saying that. We have its just nobody cares when its tottenham Just a way easier league. Lacazette scored 4 in 30 league games in his last season for Arsenal, left on a free than almost took the top scorer title from Mbappe in his first season back with Lyon. Havertz üíÄ  Let's not kid ourselves... No, transfermarkt is inaccurate He said the two best attacking trios of all time referring to MSN and BBC. Of course the Bayern trio were third at best? yeah he played with injections for months. He had an ankle injury after besiktas game and fell out of form Well then Mbapp√© has more as well because he‚Äôs scored penalties for France lol. Yeah omg.. Just needed one touch babyy My life has been a lie Thats a legend right there. Love those type of people.  As you say, it genuinely is a legit stat and adds more context and credit to players that arent forwards.   When added on top of progressive passes, pass accuracy, pass volume etc you get a really interesting picture. Them counting the same does not really make sense though. A secondary assist is a useless stat in a lot of instances. The player playing a simple pass to KDB who puts a perfect ball onto Haaland's head  does not really deserve much credit for that. I know that happens with regular assists too but it is a lot more common hockey assists Yeah its awesome. YES! Atleast the winning a pen should absolutly be given as something more tangible. > winning penalties   I think transfermarkt.de is already doing that wow haven't heard that name in a while I actually remember that thread and enjoyed it very much. Shows how underrated Brandt is too. :) Yeah shouldnt get lumped together. Removes nuance & context. Those 2 are basically the primary ones atm but they arent always super telling. Progressive passes is nice but Id like to add pre-assists into the mix to add a bigger picture. 114 spectacular seconds I imagine. I think I managed to turn it around for you, you're saved! Keep in mind that Kane never had star quality. Led to him only egtting the credit much later than most youngsters, but he got it in the end. Rib√©ry Robben Lewa are definitely inferior to MSN and BBC. And that‚Äôs no shame. I‚Äôm not saying Mbapp√© has scored less pens than Kane this season, he hasn‚Äôt (Ligue 1 teams love committing fouls in the box apparently), but I‚Äôm saying you shouldn‚Äôt discredit Mbapp√©‚Äôs season. Its a common mistake. In germany they say Sporting Lissabon too. üòÇ Well just putting numbers on anything is dumb when you think about it every position has its individual situations you could pass to messi in your own half and he dribbles past 6 players to score It's about the number of occurrence, rodri won't always be the one passing to kdb for an insane assist whereas messi will always be making the most threatening play, be that the primary assist or secondary assist or the scorer What about a midfielder making a perfect pass out to the winger who then has a simple cutback to the striker? You can make up a scenario either way where only one player deserves credit, and a more generous one would make it more likely that at least the player responsible would get credit. I agree but the thought is that with enough of a sample size you will see the guys frequently involved with build up/scoring plays.   Granted you can see that by watching too lol PES 5 legend. Oh well, it's no news for you then. Still I love to look through it and will update it after the season is finished Yeah, I‚Äôve appreciated that they count those, but like you said it would be better to separate the assist and secondary assist into two separate stats.  Would allow for context and to see defenders or midfielders that have more progressive passes than others that play the same role. You‚Äôre a miracle worker. We need you at Chelsea üôè Lewa is not inferior to Benz, neither was Robben to Bale. You disagree? I think most media puts the city in when it's not necessarily well known where the club is from. Like, everyone says PSV Eindhoven when Eindhoven isn't in the official name either. Pretty sure I've seen ""Celtic Glasgow"" as well. Ah yes the busquets special A thread that doesnt hurt to read twice anyway :)   Looking forward to that update! Love those pieces. Exactly. Some players might have more progressive passes but less line-breaking/effective ones than someone with less who has more pre-assists.   Its a fun added nuance imo. I wouldn't say no to a short contract, like until 2035? Lewa = Benzema, Robben to Bale is a toss up but CR7 definitely elevates BBC over the Bayern trio Definitely heard those two before as well hahah 2053 and you have a deal Sorry but Lewa is miles better. Lewa literally went to laliga at the end of his career and beat Benzema to the Pichichi. Has Benzema ever been the best goal scorer in a calendar year? He literally top scored once in Laliga, and you cannot blame Ronaldo for it because Ronaldo left 6 years ago. And stuff like Galatasaray Istanbul Okay, if you think so. In the end it doesn‚Äôt matter though. Madrids trio has better numbers than Bayerns trio and MSN outshines them all"
"Real Madrid's transfer plan leaves no surprises or panic buys. They don't live from summer to summer, Instead they plan years in advance. This policy is due to an economic issue, they'd rather miss on Havertz or Kane and go striker-less for a season saving money to pursue Mbappe the next year.","2024-03-23T14:51:21+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1blu06v/real_madrids_transfer_plan_leaves_no_surprises_or/","[No textual content]","0","Real_Tactical","https://www.relevo.com/futbol/mercado-fichajes/maquinaria-real-madrid-anos-delante-20240322143814-nt.html","This headline reads like it was written by RM's board. They snuck in Havertz there like we wouldn't notice [deleted] The implication is ""strikerless or Mbappe"" but in reality you can sign someone who will be Mbappe's rotation in 23/24 onwards and better than Joselu. Bellingham's goalscoring form (secured 13 points in La Liga with his goals, and 7 in CL) could have not been predicted, and without it, it would be very hard to compete the season. With alleged riches in Real Madrid's warchest, there was no need to gamble the season like that. Good outcome doesn't mean a good decision. how will madrid survive missing on havertz Is it time for the Madrid fawning again While I have nothing but admiration for the recruitment job done by RM over the last few years, this is pretty much standard operating procedure for any club competing at the very top level. There is always the ""Mpabb√© next year"" > TAA  Doubt x Sounds like something written by the Madrid PR agency. Wow ...slow claps. People are joking, but this is a legit take. Madrid don't spend 30-50 million for the Gakpos, the Gravenberchs, the Boeys, the Zaragozas, the Raphinhas etc of this world. All good players but none of them are either a) world class or b) generational talents. Clubs like Bayern look at their squad for the season, find out that they need a RB and then look at the market for RBs and sign someone like Boey that might or might not work out. Problem is, that it will cost you a lot of money in the long run with no guaranteed chance to turn out.  Madrid look at the market and sign players with generational potential even if they don't cover a need in the current squad (look at all the criticism over the Bellingham transfer because Madrid bought another midfielder instead of a  striker as Benzema replacement) and risk leaving holes in the squad for a specific season but instead plan long-term.  Madrid would be UCL favorites this season if they had foregone their Mbappe dream and signed Kane last summer. But with Mbappe they're gonna be favorites for the next 5+ seasons.  Edit: love how everyone brings up transfers from pre 2019 which basically proves my point. Madrid's transfer policy changed after the flops that were Hazard and (especially) Jovic. Havertz hahaha bene gesserit wannabes Just like they receive preferential treatment from the Spanish government, La Liga administration and UEFA which are all well planned in advance. Don Perez must have personally dictated it to the journalist lol It‚Äôs just missing the ‚Äúwrite something like‚Ä¶‚Äù at the beginning. Tbf, there was a point where he was heavily linked in the media, just like Kane was It amazes me how little shit they get for tapping up top players to try and get free transfers, when most other clubs would be crucified for the same They will once they sign Arnold. Thank you. RM fan here and the way people talk about Jude's season and our season in general is frustrating. What he's doing is ABNORMAL. It is a freak of nature. The amount of goals he's scoring is not his baseline and I guarantee you it is not sustainable. We need real structure, not just ""Vibes FC"" and late game winners against bottom table teams. So not us? We started to do it now. But since nasri and Feb left, it was chaos. That is such revisionist rubbish. There‚Äôs no difference between say, Real Madrid gambling on Camavinga or Tchouam√©ni than Bayern with Renato Sanches or Mathys Tel. Where was the purchase of Hazard in this long term thinking? Or not bolstering their centre backs? They should have gone with replacing Benzema as well as Bellingham. Instead they had to panic loan Joselu. There‚Äôs no grand plan there because Mbappe is not going to cover the same territory or position. Jovic, Diaz,  Morata? At the same time replaced ronaldo with mariano diaz and gave him the no7 Havertz and Jesus were players that Carlo really really wanted. Flo wants turtle free transfers aren't always great, they fuck up wage structure which hurts more in longer term. You can‚Äôt talk bad about Madrid around here He's a scouser, he's not leaving. Yeah and we didn't compete at the top level. We panic purchases 5th choice mustafi and left him to wreck havoc as the starting center back for 3 seasons Ironic that you called his comment revisionist rubbish but you did the same thing. Hazard was best PL footballer and Real had big hole left after Ronaldo. Nobody could predict his downfall. Alaba got injured in december and Spanish club really doesn't want to make any hasty moves in the winter transfer window. Joselu wasn't panic loan, he was brought early and was supposed to be Mariano replacement. 1. Yeah I'll definitely give you Tel and Sanches. But none of the likes of Boey or Zaragoza were considered as generational talents. Tchouameni is different, he was brought in as a young but first division established player taking the next step to world class, not as a talent.  2. Hazard is the same revisionist bullshit you called out, he was brought as the galactico Ronaldo replacement but yeah, since he failed massively, Madrid learned from that mistake.  3. Joselu was not a panic loan because of Benzema's exit. He was supposed to be the backup even before Benzema left. Also that ""panic loan"" was virtually for free considering his fee and wages. That's a lot better than signing a RB for 30m in winter because you're first choice is at AFCON or injured.  4. Mbappe's heatmap is very similar to Benzema's, don't see your point there. >Where was the purchase of Hazard in this long term thinking?  Hazard was signed in 2019, that's a long time ago. Madrid has clearly changed their transfer policy. Turtle guy is better at kicking the football than the other two, maybe Flo knows a thing or two about this football business The issue isnt that he is good or no, its that Carlo has to win now, Turtle coming in 2024(supposedly, not even hoping at this point) and doesnt help him win titles before that Given how good they have been for us (minus jesus injuries) and also a few other things, maybe ancelotti knows about football too Well maybe Carlo knows a thing or two about squad building and how to make his squad succeed instead of chucking all the very best players in like PSG."

""What if we never do that again ... but instead just normalize 80m‚Ç¨ transfers!"" I forgot City unveiled Grealish the day when Barca released Messi >I feel that this record won't be broken for some time, since this is more of a powerplay by a team funded by an entire country for arguably the 3rd best player in the world. I expect at least 5 years for the record to be broken tbh.  However, I feel this transfer made the 100m mark, which was quite obscene to go above, a bit normalised and we may see more transfers in the 100-150m region in the coming time.   This guy just gets it For Ronaldo transfer to Madrid, the comments are at 0.024k and the upvotes at around 0.033k (it fluctuates with each refresh).  Or simpler, 24 and ~33. **Players Who Appear Multiple Times**  * Neymar (x3) * Romelu Lukaku (x3) * Cristiano Ronaldo (x2) * Kai Havertz (x2)  **Clubs that Appear the Most**  * Real Madrid (x7) * Manchester United (x7) * Barcelona (x6) * Chelsea (x6) * Juventus (x5) * Manchester City (x4)  Some other humorous things I found...  * r/Soccer was barely alive back in 2009. Hence why the link is from r/sports. I enjoyed some of the comments from back then.  > He seems like the sort of player that needs discipline and in terms of that, there is no one better than Alex Ferguson. Which is why I don't think this would be a great move for him, I could be wrong.   * Having meditated on the list, while there are many poor transfers here, I think it's safe to say Hazard is the worst transfer of All-Time.  * I had honestly forgotten about the immense skepticism over the likelihood of the Bale signing working out. In large part due to the fact he was Welsh lol [This seems so insane in hindsight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6wf42d/breaking_psg_agree_deal_to_sign_kylian_mbappe/dm7yjw1/) ""From underwhelming links to Carrasco, Brahimi, and the likes to getting linked to Zaha and then fucking signing Pepe for 80m, that's some big dick turn around."" LMAOOOO One of the best posts on this sub, so much nostalgia. Seeing what people said back then and how it ended up is amazing. >50  most expensive transfers in football history  gives 80   clickbait title Wild that Hazard is the most expensive transfer that people thought was not an overpay, and he turned out to be one of the worst transfers in history That N'Dombele thread is so fucking depressing, you can only laugh Someone said ‚ÄòI have a feeling the Bale transfer will go down as the worst of all time.‚Äô  Talk about being horrendously wrong. 2 years away from that 600 million transfer Zinedine Zidane going for 75 million in 2001 is absolutely insane. Imagine what he would cost today On the sancho post:  > [‚Äì]TheRedWizard17  > 80 points 3 years ago   > WOOOOOOOO > now cue the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs overrated‚Äù comments  oh mate he's the one who jinxed it # 42 | ‚Ç¨77.50M | Jul. 9 2001 | Zin√©dine Zidane | Real Madrid | N/A | N/A | N/A     The Zidane transfer fee is still the most craziest when you think about it and put it in perspective.  For context, based on [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/real-madrid-achieved-highest-revenue-history-843-million-amir-somoggi/) link, Real Madrid's revenue that year was only 138 million Euros! Wild.   Picked up this comment under Mbappe‚Äôs transfer   ‚ÄúI think Dembel√® and Asensio are better than him, at least when it comes to technique. Mbapp√® is great at goalscoring but that‚Äôs the most inconsistent thing possible, if he stops scoring he will be a massive flop‚Äù I completely forgot Ronaldo was at Juve. Zidane being here is crazy. Out of 7 Madrid buys, 5 were a total success, James a good one, and Hazard was.... Haxard Really can't believe Antony is the 19th most expensive transfer  In hindsight it seems completely nuts That Lukaku - Chelsea thread is so optimistic. Fuck. Brilliant post OP.  Well done. I have previously upvoted an embarrassing amount of these   I need to spend less time on this godforsaken site lol Did we ever get that tattooed nutsack? Just wanted to add a comment so this gets more visibility in the algorithm, really fun stuff OP. Also nice to know some /r/soccer jokes haven't changed in a decade, some threads have as the top comment ""Wow this was out of nowhere"" for transfers that were widely reported. People saying that Zlatan was very overrated is so funny. I know he probably peaked pretty late in his career but in hindsight he had one of the most fun careers of all time, playing in 4/5 of the top 5 leagues. He‚Äôs easily a top 5 striker that we have seen for the last 15 years and one of the most iconic one of all time. Such a legend. If we adjust for impact and inflation - Figo move won't be #87.  It should be in top 3 considering it happened in 2000 for 60 million. Also it was very controversial from Barca to Madrid.  It started Perez era we are seeing today. not gonna lie, to this day when I see a big transfer I can't help but see in units of Torres's = 50m pounds Fucking Coutinho hahahaha guy‚Äôs back at Vasco nowadays Fascinating to see posts from 2008 like Ronaldo and Kaka to Madrid. Cool to see what Reddit was like back then the Coutinho one still gets me. > Ben white is only 4 years younger than varane who is a world class CB compared to White who is an average pl defender and even then varane‚Äôs prospective fee (50 million euros) would be 8 million less than white to arsenal > > Even considering the one year left on the deal in comparison Man Utd are getting much more bang for their buck.  Well‚Ä¶. Still makes me giggle that PSG threw 400 million to sign 2 players, added Messi to that later on and STILL couldn't win the UCL. Couldn't even win the league every year. Seeing all the comments about the Osimhen signing really makes me smile.  The striker that won us the title and a lot of people were happy but, justly, some people thought that we were overpaying him (again, fair enough).  It just makes me smile now.   Also one guy said that he'd be better than Cavani.  In a way, he was right Would be nice as well to put the clubs theh transferred from The whole ndombele to spurs thread aged like rotten milk. Where‚Äôs my man Nicolas Pepe? That Ibra thread lol. How many people promised to tattoo their balls in these kinds of threads? Great post Rating as a hit or miss, Darwin‚Äôs rating is post That ¬£116m spent on Enzo Fernandez is going down the drain lol.  Obligatory fuck PSG for spending nearly ¬£360 million on two players alone, but I guess there is still justice in this world that they have yet to won the UCL and these two players have now all left. Neymar to Al Hilal cost 90 million?? Looking at the Isak one is quality.  >>Brother you just scammed Newcastle.  >>That's a hell of a lot of money for Isak  >>He's a good player but he's not 70m good.  >>bro that‚Äôs wayyy too much lmao  >>I remember when we looked at him, it looked like he had everything in his locker apart from finishing.  (Arsenal fan)  >>I don't know man, I think he's terribly overrated here on reddit. Most of the time he's just an average striker.  >>He‚Äôs not worth that, even in this inflated market.   >>He's been wank for a while and isn't even a goalscorer.  >>70M for Isak is just crazy. Real Sociedad hit a jackpot here.  Now for the accurate predictions:  >>Isak is worth more. Everyone will say Newcastle got rinsed but the kid has talent and will be one of the best strikers in the world one day.  Thats pretty much it, majority of the comments are shitting on him.  Turns out the people who said he wasn't worth 70m were strangely right - he's worth at least 120m. Regarding the RKM saga a year ago: yes, I still think he‚Äôs a dick, but while things were a little rough for a while, Marmoush filled in for him really well. It‚Äôs also amazing to see how every PSG fan hated Ekitik√© for not wanting to join Eintracht that summer. PSG went on to absolutely demolish the guy by treating him like garbage and not even offering him any sort of professional training. Half a year later, Ekitik√© did join Eintracht, on loan with a significantly lower option to buy than what PSG wanted for him in the summer. Ekitik√©‚Äôs fitness was atrocious. He was fit as in ‚Äúhe kept himself fit‚Äù, but nowhere near professional level fit. It took us three months to get him back to professional fitness levels, but since he arrived there, he has been a fantastic addition to the squad.   Fuck PSG with a rusty nail board, but cheers for the 95 million and Ekitik√© I guess. You can buy him back for another 100 million in a year. In my opinion I genuinely believe the only worthy transfer was Ronaldo to Real Madrid.  He not only done it for himself but the club, especially the hattrick of CL, not to mention his insane goal record on top.  No other player with a high price even did half, ¬£80m back then was insane, I still remember waking up in 2009 reading ""Man Utd accept ¬£80m Ronaldo bid"" this was the article i saw http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8094720.stm  Even though I was gutted he left the price felt fair, then years later I see the same price spent on a fidget spinner.  The Neymar and Mbappe ones were more of a shock as it felt weird, it didn't sit right.  Edit: can't even share my personal opinion without downvotes, its even more bizarre as a player I liked Messi more, I just couldn't admit it as I was young back in 2009, but im sane and level headed to understand players.  Today? People take everything personal which is quite sad, appreciate both because its the end and well never see two going at it in our lifetime. [deleted] On Mbappe's transfer:  >or 0.81 Neymar   >>actually insane to think about when Mbappe has only played 1 season   >All these clubs chasing him have been doing so since he was in his early teens. We bid ¬£40m last summer when he'd only scored one senior goal.   >Last season was just confirmation of what they already thought. The kid is a once in a generation talent.  >>How is he ""once in a generation"" when he is (arguably) just marginally better than Dembele and Asensio? Any of the three could end up being better than the other 2, they can hardly be ranked amongst each other   >I think Dembel√® and Asensio are better than him, at least when it comes to technique. Mbapp√® is great at goalscoring but that's the most inconsistent thing possible, if he stops scoring he will be a massive flop Oh my god...r/soccer court....so cringe And then some Americans appear at Chelsea and said how bout we start doing crazy shit again I think that‚Äôs the natural reaction to so many ‚Ç¨100m transfer being busts or‚Ä¶not complete successes.  Clubs are hesitant to spend that much, and it puts a lot of pressure on 1 person. Can you imagine the time line where Messi went to City and got the #10   I wonder what all would Be different‚Ä¶ Quite accurate. However, 100-150M transfers haven't been as frequent since that transfer as we all feared at that time. Lots of transfers within the 90-110M range for sure though but that isn't as ridiculous a jump from the 70-80M mark that used to be there with the likes of Higuain Pogba and Bale prior to Neymar. Funny how the top comment on that thread is like ""I don't know if this is the right move for him"". I chuckled. I still got my news from the newspapers back then lol. Pretty sure I still have some of the cutouts back at my parents house.  I remember watching the news breaking in my college cafeteria TV. He was injured to iirc and all the pictures were of him in crutches.   And Madrid had just unveiled freaking Kaka earlier too. I'm reading Ronaldo to Juventus and people are so hyped¬†   >[‚Äì]aNigerianPrince¬†132 points¬†6 years ago¬†  >Juventus 2019 CL winners confirmed     Funny people now say Juventus were a poor team and Ronaldo made a mistake joining them Even back in 2013 when I joined, this place was tiny. The number of daily posters was so small you kind of knew everyone and ended up discussing things with the same few dozen people.   It was definitely miles better for serious football discussion, but now the community is so big I love that we have people from basically every country who can give their differing viewpoints, especially on topics where sport and culture/politics butt up against each other. Stories like the Argentina/France chant you can go in the threads and find French people and Argentines explaining how it‚Äôs being viewed in their countries or giving more background detail,  And the highlights and how quickly they‚Äôre posted is insane. It was a big talking point that bale was a homebody. Would go back home to wales any chance he got while at spurs so it was a genuine concern he wouldn‚Äôt settle in Spain We are also with 4 appearances: Nunez, Van Dijk, Szobo and Alisson. Di Maria is on there twice as well > I'd honestly put Mbappe clearly above Dembele, whom I'd put clearly ahead of anyone else. Similarly to how Ronaldo and Pulisic are clearly above everyone else right now, only that Mbappe and Dembele wouldn't be as far ahead.  i need to speak to the guy who said this [Nvm this is even funnier ](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6vz2qt/comment/dm41acf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) An entire comment chain talking bs. That comment made me actually chuckle when I read it, I wasn't here at the time, but I remember watching Mbape for Monaco the previous year in the Champions League, and looking back to see someone say he is arguably worse than Dembele is mental to think about, nevermind the number of updoots and replies saying similar if not more baffling things. Now that the site has been around and popular for over a decade I love looking to see if I can find the reddit thread whenever someone posts an ""X years ago Y player did this."" I just wish reddit didn't delete comments when users deleted their accounts, a lot of those threads are just [deleted]: Deleted It‚Äôs due to inflation The optimism from Spurs fans is... haunting. It went horrendously wrong for anyone that played them in the CL McGawf incoming Even just off inflation alone we're probably looking somewhere around the 130 mils. The man would be top 5 transfers for sure, very very likely top 3 Figo cost 1/3rd of Madrid‚Äôs yearly revenue which today would be almost ‚Ç¨300 million The 2017 transfer?? Crazy how they all 3 ended up at PSG together last season I think they got the technique part right at least One of his more underrated periods honestly, Covid fucked so much with time, this jump and header is absolutely insane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AunImole9HI  Literally floats in the air, fucking hell that Juventus should've done more but Ajax 2019 sneaked up to their asses like with Madrid The GOAT Fred made the list. My King Zlatan biggest failure is never winning a champions league He's #39 i think Bale was also worth it, he was a clutch player in the CL triple. Out of the whole list?  Its hard to judge anyone against Ronaldo tbf, regardless of amount spent. But like just chosing one, Van Dijk to Liverpool Has Been insanely succesfull, if it wasnt for utter City domination they wouldbeasily won more titles adding to what they actually won Barcelona completely squandered the money after, but Neymar for 88m(even with the shady dealings) was 100% worth it. With him in the squad we won a treble, a domestic double, and then a CDR. After that we more than doubled our money with the 220m euros for him. Hard to say that wasn't worth it, even though the future transfers fucked us up. Bale ChatGPT ass comment You're welcome for our foolishness [deleted] To be fair if COVID hadn't happened we would have seen a lot more transfers in that range. Just look at how high some transfers are right now even after having even bankruptcy dangers off COVID. Micah Richards level of foresight. I originally joined around 2014ish iirc and miss those days tbh, feel like all of the regular posters from back then have slowly disappeared, but it felt like much more of a community then. Early 2010s /r/soccer was a lot of fun OP is talking about in the top50 i presume rather than the top 80 which he listed, seeing how he also left out de Ligt (and probably some others) who is also twice on the list Lmao I'm sure Pulisic was just a meme, I don't think he's ever been close to being regarded as top 10 in the world The funniest thing looking back on threads from years ago is how often most people are wrong on here, you‚Äôll find people who are right all the time but the majority of people just has no idea wtf they are talking about (me included) The other fans saying how great of a signing it was is also jarring Yes Found an inflation calculator. It says he would cost 175 million euros in today‚Äôs market. Jesus Christ. Ten Hag masterclass, no wonder Ronaldo hated him It's very annoying though. Pretty sure City didnt Play Stoke si≈Ñce Grealish joined so the question would still stand well the fact that Stoke don‚Äôt play PL ball doesn‚Äôt help ofcourse he would have  league stage messi is unstoppable, he played motm level in a swimming pool instead of pitches in LL Tbh, that kinda goes for the whole internet, it feels like. Some of the poster  was swallowed up by big medias as writers iirc I will fully admit I am wrong 97% of the time. What does Ten Hag have to with this? This is why I make random history references. To keep the relative insanity in the internet at high levels Come on man He was the manager of Ajax in their win against Juventus that the other comment mentioned."
"[OC] Personal analysis of all the controversial Ballon D'or podiums, plus a recap of the award's history and rules","2024-09-07T09:43:45+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fb390j/oc_personal_analysis_of_all_the_controversial/","
The Ballon D'or started being awarded in 1956 by the French magazine ""France Football"", responsible of selecting both the shortlist of candidates and the football journalists in charge of voting, which are one from each country and went from the initial few dozens just from Europe to almost 200 from all over the world

The journalists have to vote for their personal 3 or 5 best players of the year, which then get an assigned number of points depending on their place

A very big flaw of the award is the fact that until 1995 non-European players couldn't be nominated, therefore not allowing to partecipate players of the caliber of Pel√®, Maradona and others (little analysis about it in the comments)

Another minor problem is that over time and depending on the cases the award basically went from annual to seasonal, until this finally becomed official in 2022



Now a quick review of all the podiums:



**1956**

1) Matthews¬†¬†

2) Di Stefano¬†¬†

3) Kopa¬†¬†


Not a good start, Matthews won by just 3 points and while it was mostly an award to his career there were still some complaints considering the excellent second placed (Di Stefano was Argentinian but was eligible because he also had the Spanish citizenship)



**1957**¬†¬†

1) Di Stefano¬†¬†

2) Billy Wright¬†¬†

3) Duncan Edwards/Kopa (same number of points)¬†¬†



**1958**¬†¬†

1) Kopa¬†¬†

2) Helmut Rahn¬†¬†

3) Fontaine¬†¬†


Di Stefano should have surely been at least in the top three if not directly first, but wasn't eligible for the shortlist because he had already won in the previous year (an idea immediately scrapped). In any case it should be noted this was the year where Pel√® scored 75 goals, a new record and his personal best, of which 6 in the World Cup all between quarters, semis and final



**1959**¬†¬†

1) Di Stefano¬†¬†

2) Kopa¬†¬†

3) John Charles¬†¬†



**1960**¬†¬†

1) Suarez¬†¬†

2) Puskas¬†¬†

3) Seeler¬†¬†


Suarez was great, but Puskas had probably the best season of his career and should have definitely won (47 goals in the season, won the CL while being the top scorer and with 4 goals in the final)



**1961**¬†¬†

1) Sivori¬†¬†¬†

2) Suarez¬†¬†

3) Johnny Haynes¬†¬†


Sivori was Argentinian but also had the Italian citizens hip which made him eligible



**1962**¬†¬†

1) Masopust¬†¬†

2) Eusebio¬†¬†

3) Schnellinger¬†


It's true that Czechoslovakia arrived in final of the World Cup and Masopust was the second best player of the tournament (after Garrincha), but considering his anonymous club season in a minor league I think Eusebio could have been another good choice after winning the Champions League and being the best player of his team, even if scoring less than what he will do in the following seasons



**1963**¬†¬†

1) Yashin¬†¬†

2) Rivera¬†¬†

3) Jimmy Greaves¬†¬†


Lev Yashin was the first and also last goalkeeper to win the award, and when he gets called the best ever in his position it's also thanks to this Ballon D'or. But it should be noted however that this was one of the (many) years where the real best player was actually Pel√®



**1964**¬†¬†

1) Denis Law¬†¬†

2) Suarez¬†¬†

3) Amancio¬†¬†


Law scored over 40 goals during the season which was surely impressive, but Suarez was the main architect of Inter's victory in Champions League and also Spain's one in the Euros, and I think he should have won



**1965**¬†¬†

1) Eusebio¬†¬†

2) Facchetti¬†¬†

3) Suarez¬†¬†



**1966**¬†¬†

1) Charlton¬†¬†

2) Eusebio¬†¬†

3) Beckenbauer¬†¬†


Charlton was great and won the World Cup with England, but Eusebio was at just 1 point from him after the incredible and never repeated achievement of being the top scorer of the league, of the Champions League and also of the World Cup, and I think he could have definitely been first



**1967**¬†¬†

1) Florian Albert¬†¬†

2) Charlton¬†¬†

3) Jimmy Johnstone¬†¬†



**1968**¬†¬†

1) Best¬†¬†

2) Charlton¬†¬†

3) D≈æajiƒá¬†¬†


Deserved win, but I think Eusebio could have definitely been in the top three after scoring 50 goals and reaching the semifinals in CL while also being the top scorer, even if Portugal failed to qualify for the Euros (which at the time only had 4 teams) 



**1969**¬†¬†

1) Rivera¬†¬†

2) Gigi Riva¬†¬†

3) Muller¬†¬†



**1970**¬†¬†

1) Muller¬†¬†

2) Bobby Moore¬†¬†

3) Gigi Riva¬†¬†



**1971**¬†¬†

1) Cruyff¬†¬†

2) Mazzola¬†¬†

3) Best¬†¬†



**1972**¬†¬†

1) Beckenbauer¬†¬†

2) Muller¬†¬†

3) Netzer¬†¬†


The top 3 was all German and very close for number of points (with Cruyff being fourth and close as well),  this was also the year where Muller scored an incredible 85 goals which was the new record and lasted till 2012. Despite this there was no particular controversy because Beckenbauer was simply considered the best of the three



**1973**¬†¬†

1) Cruyff¬†¬†

2) Zoff¬†¬†

3) Muller¬†¬†



**1974**¬†¬†

1) Cruyff¬†¬†

2) Beckenbauer¬†¬†

3) Kazimierz Deyna¬†¬†



**1975**¬†¬†

1) Blochin¬†¬†

2) Beckenbauer¬†¬†

3) Cruyff¬†¬†


Despite being a name mostly forgotten and the incredible competition (even if not in their best year), Blochin's award was deserved and also won by a large margin


**1976**¬†¬†

1) Beckenbauer¬†¬†

2) Rensenbrink¬†¬†

3) Ivo Viktor¬†¬†



**1977**¬†¬†

1) Simonsen¬†¬†

2) Keegan¬†¬†

3) Platini¬†¬†



**1978**¬†¬†

1) Keegan¬†¬†

2) Krankl¬†¬†

3) Rensenbrink¬†¬†


Definitely the weirdest case so far, Keegan wasn't remotely as good as in the previous season, when he could have easily won over Simonsen, or also as the following one but in the end still got the award. We can't even say he had no competition considering Krankl was close for number of points after scoring over 40 goals during the year between Rapid Vienna and Barcelona (plus 4 with Austria at the World Cup, for which England didn't even qualify). In any case a good candidate for the weakest edition ever



**1979**¬†¬†

1) Keegan¬†¬†

2) Rummenigge¬†¬†

3) Ruud Krol¬†¬†



**1980**¬†¬†

1) Rummenigge¬†¬†

2) Bernd Schuster¬†¬†

3) Platini¬†¬†



**1981**¬†¬†

1) Rummenigge¬†¬†

2) Breitner¬†¬†

3) Bernd Schuster¬†¬†



**1982**¬†¬†

1) Rossi¬†¬†

2) Giresse¬†¬†

3) Boniek¬†¬†


Paolo Rossi was disqualified for all the first part of the year but was also the best player of the World Cup won by Italy, in a year with a bit less competition for the award



**1983**¬†¬†

1) Platini¬†¬†

2) Dalglish¬†¬†

3) Simonsen¬†¬†



**1984**¬†¬†

1) Platini¬†¬†

2) Tigana¬†¬†

3) Elkjaer¬†¬†



**1985**¬†¬†

1) Platini¬†¬†

2) Elkj√¶r¬†¬†

3) Bernd Schuster¬†¬†



**1986**¬†¬†

1) Belanov¬†¬†

2) Lineker¬†¬†

3) Butrague√±o


Should be noted this was the year where Maradona would have easily won thanks to the World Cup, in any case it was very controversial as the other two options would have both been better than Belanov



**1987**¬†¬†

1) Gullit¬†¬†

2) Futre¬†¬†

3) Butragueno¬†¬†



**1988**¬†¬†

1) Van Basten¬†¬†

2) Gullit¬†¬†

3) Rijkaard¬†


That year the Champions League was quite irrilevant, as we can see from the top 3 with only Dutch players (and all playing for Milan) after The Netherlands won the Euros



**1989**¬†¬†

1) Van Basten¬†¬†

2) Baresi¬†¬†

3) Rijkaard¬†¬†


Once again all Milan players in the top three, Baresi had one of the best seasons ever for a defender but Van Basten was still considered the best player of the team and won without problems



**1990**¬†¬†

1) Matthaus¬†¬†

2) Schillaci¬†¬†

3) Brehme¬†¬†



**1991**¬†¬†

1) Papin¬†¬†

2) Saviƒáeviƒá/Matthaus/Panƒçev


Surprisingly there were three players with the same number of points in second position, but all quite far from Papin even if with some complaints



**1992**¬†¬†

1) Van Basten¬†¬†

2) Stoichkov¬†¬†

3) Bergkamp¬†¬†



**1993**¬†¬†

1) Baggio¬†¬†

2) Bergkamp¬†¬†

3) Cantona¬†¬†



**1994**¬†¬†

1) Stoichkov¬†¬†

2) Baggio¬†¬†

3) Maldini¬†¬†


Stoichkov probably deserved it even if Baggio was an equally good candidate for the best player of the year (apart from Romario, not eligible), but unfortunately missing a penalty and losing the World Cup final seriously damaged his chances and also his reputation



**1995**¬†¬†

1) Weah¬†¬†

2) Klinsmann¬†¬†

3) Litmanen


First year where non-Europeans are allowed and the winner was Weah who is from Liberia, despite some minor complaints I think the award was deserved¬†



**1996**¬†¬†

1) Sammer¬†¬†

2) Ronaldo¬†¬†

3) Shearer¬†¬†


A very controversial edition, Ronaldo spent the first half of the year injured at Psv but at the Olympics with Brazil and with Barcelona after the transfer he had an incredible second part of the year showing things never seen before. Sammer on the other hand had a great year with Borussia Dortmund and Germany, winning the Euros as one of the best players of the tournament and then also the Ballon D'or by just 1 point¬†¬†



**1997**¬†¬†

1) Ronaldo¬†¬†

2) Mijatoviƒá¬†¬†

3) Zidane¬†¬†


Possibly the easiest vote ever, more than anything else I'm surprised he didn't achieve the record for the win with the highest margin

Summary of the season: he was dribbling, scoring and doing what he wanted against 90% of the teams he faced, ending up with 60 goals and assists with Barcelona plus 30 (!) with Brazil and being decisive for winning Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup and Uefa Cup with the first and Copa America plus Confederations Cup with the other


**1998**¬†¬†

1) Zidane¬†¬†

2) Suker¬†¬†

3) Ronaldo¬†¬†



**1999**¬†¬†

1) Rivaldo¬†¬†

2) Beckham¬†¬†

3) Schevchenko¬†¬†


Some people wanted Beckham to win after being the best player of Manchester United which won the treble, but Rivaldo had an even better individual performance so I think it was deserved



**2000**¬†¬†

1) Figo¬†¬†

2) Zidane¬†¬†

3) Schevchenko¬†¬†


Many thought that the winner should have been Zidane and I definitely agree with them, in particular there is a possibility the voters were influenced by his polemical behavior and the red cards got during the year which certainly didn't help his chances



**2001**¬†¬†

1) Owen¬†¬†

2) Raul¬†¬†

3) Kahn¬†¬†


A lot of controversies, Owen had a good season with both Liverpool and England but Raul a better one, and in any case I think Figo could have been above both after being even better than in the previous year



**2002**¬†¬†

1) Ronaldo¬†¬†

2) Roberto Carlos¬†¬†

3) Kahn¬†¬†


Ronaldo spent the first half of the year injured at Inter but then had one of the best performances ever in the World Cup and won it. There were some complaints about winning just for the tournament, but it's also true that in this year the other candidates weren't as strong and Roberto Carlos was the main competition, plus Kahn and Zidane coming right after



**2003**¬†¬†

1) Nedvƒõd¬†¬†

2) Henry¬†¬†

3) Maldini¬†¬†


This case is controversial but mostly in retrospect, at the time there weren't many complaints (Nedved was nominated the best player of Serie A and the best midfielder of the Champions League) but considering how the rest of their careers went and that the other two never managed to win the Ballon D'or many think that either Henry or Maldini should have won it that year



**2004**¬†¬†

1) Schevchenko¬†¬†

2) Deco¬†¬†

3) Ronaldinho¬†¬†


Shevchenko had another fantastic season with Milan, but he wasn't clearly ahead of the competition and Deco, Henry and Ronaldinho could have been other good candidates depending on personal preferences



**2005**¬†¬†

1) Ronaldinho¬†¬†

2) Lampard¬†¬†

3) Gerrard¬†¬†



**2006**¬†¬†

1) Cannavaro¬†¬†

2) Buffon¬†¬†

3) Henry¬†¬†


Few controversies at the time, but it was a really tough year and I'm not totally convinced of the podium which I think was also influenced by the headbutt in the final and Juventus getting relegated for Calciopoli. Otherwise I would have expected Buffon, Cannavaro and Zidane as the top three, followed by Henry (who unfortunately lost both the CL and WC finals) and then Ronaldinho who was probably the favourite before the World Cup



**2007**¬†¬†

1) Kak√†¬†¬†

2) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

3) Messi¬†¬†



**2008**¬†¬†

1) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

2) Messi¬†¬†

3) Torres¬†¬†



**2009**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

3) Xavi¬†¬†



**2010**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) Iniesta¬†¬†

3) Xavi¬†¬†


All Barcelona podium and a lot of controversies even if especially in retrospect, I think a better podium would have been Messi, Xavi and Sneijder but it's difficult to think than one of these two could have been above Messi who had the most impressive individual season since Ronaldo in 1997. At the time most of the opposed people were Inter fans but not everybody agreed, given that many instead preferred Milito's season (incredibly not even in the shortlist)¬†



**2011**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

3) Xavi¬†¬†



**2012**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

3) Iniesta¬†¬†



**2013**¬†¬†

1) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†¬†

2) Messi¬†¬†

3) Ribery¬†¬†


Ribery was probably the best player of the treble-winning Bayern, but Ronaldo's individual season was still clearly superior. The real controversy is that for the first time the voting period was extended by two weeks with late notice, in which Ronaldo gave his best performance of the year against Sweden¬†¬†



**2014**¬†¬†

1) C. Ronaldo

2) Messi¬†¬†

3) Neuer¬†¬†


Neuer played an excellent season and as a goalkeeper he couldn't have done much more, but so did Ronaldo who was probably even better than the previous year and also won the Champions League with Real Madrid



**2015**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

3) Neymar¬†¬†



**2016**¬†¬†

1) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

2) Messi¬†¬†

3) Griezmann¬†¬†¬†


No controversy, but it would have been interesting to see Suarez's position if only he had a better reputation after all the bitings and constant diving. But in general it wasn't a great edition for strikers since Ibrahimovic arrived 13th after the best season of his career, while Higuain received 0 votes after beating the 70-years-old scoring record of Serie A with 36 goals



**2017**¬†¬†

1) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

2) Messi¬†¬†

3) Neymar¬†¬†


I remember not being totally convinced about Neymar arriving third after a less impressive season than the previous ones, and I would have preferred to have Buffon on the podium (11 years since the last time) who instead finished fourth


**2018**¬†¬†

1) Modric¬†¬†

2) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†

3) Griezmann¬†¬†


Some controversies, mostly due to several great performances both in Champions League and at the World Cup. Messi should have probably been in the top three, but at the same time having out of the podium Salah after his best season or Griezmann would have been a real pity. As for the winner instead, Ronaldo's transfer to Juve definitely didn't help him but it should be said that Modric also won the Best Fifa Award and the UEFA Player of the Year and all with big margin, so it was a true plebiscite



**2019**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) Van Dijk¬†¬†

3) C. Ronaldo¬†¬†


Messi had one of the best seasons of his career and rightfully won the award, but Van Dijk had an excellent season too and won the Champions League surprisingly managing to finish quite close for number of points



**2020**¬†¬†


The Ballon D'or was canceled in March after Covid caused some leagues to end early and canceled the Euros and Copa America. However after a while things resumed even if with some differences (no fans in the stadiums, only one leg in Champions etc) and Bayern won an incredible sextuple with Lewandowski being clearly the best player of the team


They still decided to not award it due to the difficulties of organizing the vote and the award ceremony, but given such a clear winner they could have certainly made an exception



**2021**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) Lewandowski¬†¬†¬†

3) Jorginho¬†¬†


Some controversies, starting from Jorginho who shouldn't have been third over Benzema, Mbappe or also Kant√©. As for the the winner, Messi was the favourite for most of the year but some of the public opinion shifted after his disappointing debut with Psg while at the same time Lewandowski had an excellent start of the season, however all of this happened in a period that doesn't count since the voting phase ends in October, and those months at the start of a new season should only count for the following award



**2022**¬†¬†

1) Benzema¬†¬†

2) Man√©¬†¬†¬†

3) De Bruyne¬†¬†


Clear winner and no doubts, but while I think De Bruyne third is fine even if it wasn't his best individual season, several players should have been in the podium instead of Man√© like Lewandowski, Salah or Mbappe (who had about 80 goals and assists between Psg and France...) 



**2023**¬†¬†

1) Messi¬†¬†

2) Haaland¬†¬†

3) Mbappe¬†¬†


Messi played well with PSG and then won the World Cup with one of the best performances ever in the competition, but the award still wasn't assured since Manchester City managed to achieve a treble. The main candidate was Haaland, the top scorer of the team with 50 goals, but it costed him a lot not being clearly considered the best player of his team over De Bruyne and Rodri, especially during the most important matches of the season","149","mg10pp","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fb390j/oc_personal_analysis_of_all_the_controversial/","Because of the sheer number of submissions r/soccer daily receives, standalone Discussion Threads aren't allowed in r/soccer unless they're **relevant** because of global interest or pertinent context, **valuable** because of its benefit to the community's knowledge or genuinely interesting point to discuss, and **well-presented** by the OP who wants to start it.

I‚Äôm not a Xavi stan or anything but he was absolutely wrecking every side in that span. He basically put up the same dominant performance in the 2008 and 12 Euro Final and the 2010 WC Final Enjoyed that OP! Did not realise just how insane that 1997 season was from R9. One thing you did not consider in the early years, UCL was not taken as seriously/prestigiously than the league at that time. Like in 1960 Barca won the league, Real UCL, but people voted Suarez. I think around the 80s-90s that view changed. Especially after the new format. Raul ü•≤ Want to note that 2003, the year Nevdev won, was the last ever until 2024 without either Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo being at least candidates.  20 whole years. That's a whole career. Ian Rush was robbed of at least a podium in 1984.   Won the First Division, League Cup, and European Cup.   He also won the League Golden Boot and the European golden boot. Scoring 47 goals. What a way to disrespect Deco on 2004. Best player on the champions league and carried Porto(!) to UCL title (destroyed that final and scored). Best player in Portugal (Porto national champions). Portugal was even euro finalists that year (I know it was after the season ahaha). Top assister in UCL, Uefa footballer of the year and best midfielder. Not to mention he was coming from dominating uefa cup (which porto won the year before). All the other guys ""only"" got a league title to show for. Nothing they did was greater then winning UCL with porto. Lewandowski Ranking by players with multiple wins:  - 8 - Messi  - 5 - C. Ronaldo - 3 - Cruyff - 3 - Platini - 3 - Van Basten - 2 - Di Stefano - 2 - Beckenbauer - 2 - Keegan - 2 - Rummenigge - 2 - Ronaldo  Ranking if the controversial ones went differently:  - 8 - Messi (or 7 at worst even if I don't agree) - 5 - C. Ronaldo - 4 - Di Stefano - 3 - Cruyff - 3 - Platini - 3 - Van Basten - 3 - Ronaldo - 2/3 - Eusebio - 2 - Beckenbauer - 2 - Rummenigge  - 2 - Zidane  Another thing to note is that if the award had started about ten years earlier, immediately after WWII, Puskas would have probably won at least 3 times  While if the South American players had been eligible since the start, plus also adding some journalists from the continent to the jury, we would have probably had several different results like:  - Garrincha winning in 1962 - Pel√® would have probably been in the top three about 10 times and won at least 5 awards (1961, 1963, 1964, 1969 and 1970 the most likely, for 1958, 1959 and 1960 it would have been more difficult considering he was younger and against Di Stefano and Puskas, then in 1962 he had a much better club season than Garrincha but was injured for most of the World Cup, while in 1965 he wasn't clearly better than Eusebio so it would have been a 50/50) - Kempes winning in 1978 - Zico probably winning one between 1979 and 1982 - Maradona winning in 1986 and 1987, with good chances also in 1990 and maybe even in 1979 with Argentinos Juniors due to the minor competition and depending on Zico - Romario winning in 1994 Wasnt alive to see it so I'm not gonna claim it was a robbery but Weah winning the ballon d'or with a French League Cup and merely 18 goals across all competitions as a striker will always shock me 2014 neuer was once a lifetime thing for me.  An excellent keeper and well deserved in top 3.   I doubt any keeper would top that considering more n more matches are added every year and goals per year would be 80+ for most players. I think the constant goalpost shifting is frustrating. Bayern made the semi finals of the champions league and Neuer won the World Cup but didn‚Äôt get the Balon D‚Äôor. Haaland broke the premier league goal scoring record in his 1st season and won the treble but suddenly Messi‚Äôs World Cup took precedence. Clown award and wish players and fans didn‚Äôt care it so much. 2006 was controversial. Cannavaro only received the award because people were mad about him missing out on the WC Golden Ball.   After the WC he made a transfer to Real Madrid and hardly played that calendar year.   *Edit*: I thought there was an injury at play here. Maybe he just didn't play that well. It has been a long time, eh.  It's arguably the moment the whole thing became a political game with meme-like pressure from the public. The entire Italian defense fallation was a bit of a meme.  Football was dire back then. How much I admire a great goalkeeper, having one come second is, eh, interesting to say the least. In 2021 Messi wasn't the clear winner. It was very close between. Lewandowski was the sole favourite before copa America.¬† Glorified popularity contest 2004 Deco was not controversial. Milito is the one that I think had a lot of revisionism around him, he wasn't nominated in the 20 man list but the controversy was all about Sneijder and not him. He also didn't play in the WC which would pretty much exclude him from the award. Iniesta's 2010 wasn't his best either, it goes under the radar but David Villa was the difference for Spain all the way through the quarters and was the highest ranked Spanish player  for the WC top 3 which incidentally Sneijder was also 2nd. 2020 was a ridiculous decision by France Football, claiming there are unequal games like the Bundesliga doesn't already have 4 games less than the other top leagues.  Owen was the most undeserved on the list, Totti and Raul were better. Saying Haaland was nowhere near City's best player in the games that mattered the most is a straight up lie. Got a goal and assist in one leg v Bayern in the quarter finals and a goal in the other leg. And then the 5 he got v Leipzig in the round of 16 and the MOTM performance Haaland got v Arsenal late in the season where he scored a goal, got 2 assists and won a free kick which scored City's 4th goal. Only games where Haaland wasn't that is v Real Madrid in the semis and Inter in the final. But the thing is though Messi was nowhere near PSGs best player in the champions league making said statement irrelevant. Maybe I‚Äôm misremembering it but the Balon D‚Äôor was not the award it is today when it was the ‚ÄúEuropean Footballer of the Year‚Äù award. It was still very prestigious, but when people point to the likes of Owen winning the Balon d‚ÄôOr, it was not a recognition of being the best player in the world - the FIFA World Player of the Year award was THE recognition of the world‚Äôs best player until the merger.   I‚Äôm also pretty sure that the Balon d‚ÄôOr name is a relatively recent global adoption - British football didn‚Äôt refer to it as that in the 90s and early 00s. Happy to be corrected. The Nedved one always felt like a stinker.  Yes, the Trdeln√≠khead was a great player. No doubts about that. Ballon D'Or winning great? Not sure Great job op. Thank you.

Half of the controversies wouldn't exist because the winner would be a south American player to win. Thanks, and the more people know about him the better üëçüèº Yeah I noticed it due to Eusebio not being rewarded as much as he deserved despite being one of the two best player of the Champions League before the new format (together with Di Stefano), but luckily despite the minor prestige of the competition they are still considered among the 10/20 best players of all time so that's better than nothing Yeah he was extremely close to Elkjaer in third position, just 4 points going differently and he would have been on the podium You are damn right my friend, and I knew I would have forgot something.  I hope it doesn't sound like an excuse but I mentioned him in the first edition of the post which I started making months ago, but I removed it while trying to fit within the character limit since I forgot about how good was his season. Now I've put him back as he deserves 2020 absolutely, it was a real shame Maradona‚Äôs club career outside of Napoli is really underrated. He was already the best player in Argentina and possibly the world by 1978 (at 18). I think Maradona himself said he was at his peak during his time at Argentinos. I was watching a comp of his game against Boca in 1980, absolutely unreal performance. His raw output in such a mediocre team at such a young age is incredibly impressive, as well as his influence on the game outside of that. His 1979 season (as you said) was also very good, as well as his year at Boca.  He also started his Barcelona career really well, his 1982-83 season was brilliant, although his 1983-84 season was completely derailed by his infamous ankle injury.   Maradona having poor longevity is a myth as well. He was basically world class from 1978 to his drugs ban in 1991, 13 years of top performances in an era where it was a lot more difficult to maintain longevity at the top level than it is today. Couple that with his 1986 World Cup performance (and his Napoli career) and you‚Äôve got a top three player ever in my opinion. >f the award had started about ten years earlier, immediately after WWII, Puskas would have probably won at least 3 times  What's crazy with Puskas is that he didn't join Madrid until he was 31 years old and still managed to score almost 250 goals.   >Maradona 1 in 1986 and 1987, with good chances also in 1990 and maybe even in 1979 with Boca Juniors due to the minor competition and depending on Zico  Disagree on this one. Kevin Keegan was ridiculous that season for Hamburg, and he won the award by a massive margin.   Kempes in 1978 is one of the clearest cut winners ever if he'd been eligible. Not only top scorer and player of the tournament at a World Cup that he won, but he also had a stellar season at Valencia, with 39 goals in 46 appearances.   Pele would have still been at a disadvantage because he wasn't playing in Europe, and it still would have been a very euro-centric award. He very likely would have won a couple, though.   Maradona was different as he was actually playing in Europe. I wanted to make this post since we are more or less in the awards season and we can often see discussions about it, but let's say that for one reason or another sometimes they are quite questionable and not always well informed, so I think this might be both useful and interesting  I tried to put all the main controversies (plus some info and notes) between those that I already knew on my own and a lot of research, but in reality there are complaints basically every year given that in the end only one player can win and obviusly everybody has his favourite. In any case I hope you liked it and let me know what you think! yam squeal safe engine fear plucky amusing flag exultant memorize   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Ronaldo oughtta be 6, honestly. There's no way Modric was better than Ronnie in 2018 + Luka wasn't even the best player for Croatia in the WC, let  alone Golden Ball worthy. weah was scary good. I miss when it didn't all come down to goals and wins but I understand how difficult it is to not consider those Yeah but you also have to look at the quality of those goals and him being a constant danger for 90 minutes each game, Weah was incredible in those years Weah was brutal. I remember him and he got this one year where he was ahead of everyone else.  One of those players that justify buying tickets for a game. Neuer and Haaland are far less popular than those who beat them, that's all there is to it The difference was that Neuer was far behind Ronaldo and Messi in 13/14 whereas Messi was pretty equal to Haaland in 22/23. The shifting goalposts is because there's more than one criteria.  It's all about the narrative, the lowest common denominator, normally driven by any combination of:   General performances through goals and assists  Big trophies won  And big moments  It can be any combination of these things so a reason for a player's win one season may not be the same as the following season. Yoire comparing seasons 8 years apart, between a keeper and an attacker. With a completely different batch of voters. Dont expect consistency. The main criteria is being the best player in the world and THEN its differentiated by trophies. Messi and Ronaldo were so far ahead of Neur that he could have won a sextuple and the world cup and still wouldnt have deserved the Ballon'dor because of the levels between them. For 2023, Messi and Haaland were relatively even, the voters decided to give more weight to the World Cup over the treble and thats why Messi won. I believe he played many games for Madrid, just not exactly as the best defender in the world.  It‚Äôs interesting how much this award helped his legacy, I pretty regularly see him placed in Italy all time teams or even see him listed as one of the best Italian players of all time. My understanding is that Nesta was always more highly rated during their careers. Cannavaro won for his performance in the wolrd cup semi final, which to be fair was the best defensive performance I've ever seen. It was almost laughable by the end of the game how he just kept making clearances and  interceptions. He was injured, but when he played was nothing special. Cannavaro in Real Madrid feels cursed, post facto. Let's not exaggerate, I remember than in June he was still considered the second or third favourite right after Kant√©, and after the various performances during the summer tournaments the award was basically guaranteed without any more doubt  The transfer to Psg and the poor start was surely unexpected but Lewandowski scoring like crazy in August and September (which in addition should only count for the following award) it's certainly not enough to change the winner It became a global award in 2007.  I think I recall it being called ""European Footballer of the Year"" up to 2006 in English-speaking media. I disagree, I thought he was brilliant at the time. Definitely Juventus' best player in 2003 when they won Serie A and got to the Champions League final, and if he hadn't been suspended, they probably would've won it. He was the best player at Euro 2004 too. And again, if he hadn't got injured in the semi final, there's a good chance Czech Republic could've won it, they were playing the best football in that Euros. Thanks! It was an hard work but I enjoyed making this post üëçüèº Ah I see, in that case all the Ronaldo you see from 2007 onwards are Cristiano Ronaldo and I'm going to add something to differentiate him Yeah, thankfully it only lasted for 5 years and then the two awards split again The award was for the European Player of the Year, there was no pretense that it was supposed to crown the best player overall. Most European journalists would have freely recognised Pele's superority in his prime. Were you expecting non europeans to win the European Footballer of the Year award? They mocked him when he came to brazil (and was relatively unknow) because he choose to play for portugal (Brazil was absurdely stacked on midfield unfortunately). When he played people fell in love. He was old, injured and humiliating people left and right and even won the league with fluminense. Absolutely an underrated legend. cooing intelligent cause tease mourn versed grandiose quaint outgoing quack   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Exactly, well said Yeah for Pel√® that's why I specified this would have been the possible outcome only if they also added journalists from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia etc, otherwise with just European ones it wouldn't have been very likely Didi is a good name but honestly I don't think any if them would have had a lot of chances  And yeah more than ""controversial going differently"" it would be ""controversial one going correctly"", because just many people complaining doesn't mean they are right  So for 2013 it's true but we must also consider that in those 5 years where the award was merged with the Fifa one they knew that the majority of coaches and captains would have already voted for Ronaldo and Messi, so it may be that they decided to vote for other less popular names but maybe if it had been just journalists like always they wouldn't have voted the same way Wdym? They chose Rib√©ry before the out of nowhere votes extension? Ra√≠ probably would have won in 92 Yeah so FIFA was wrong in giving him the Golden Ball, and the FIFA Best Award. While UEFA was wrong for giving him UEFA Player of the Year. All the journalists etc that voted for him for the Ballon d'Or were also mistaken, and so was France Football for giving him the award?     All these people made mistakes/ deliberately chose him over the actual best player, Ronaldo??     Isn't it much simpler to just accept he deserved it, as all of these experts agree? No one was equal to Haaland in 22/23. He should have won the player of the tournament, arguably, but he was denied. Outrage ensued. It's a bit less intense and psycho than it would have been in (more) social media era, but it was there. Even while club-wise being meh , he got both the Ballon D'Or and Fifa's player of the year because of the outrage and over-romanticizing. piquant marvelous practice far-flung hateful ripe bored bow pet fall   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* They chose him even with the extension. It was the period with captains and coaches, they gave it to Ronaldo.   And it wasn‚Äôt just an extension. FIFA even said already cast votes could be changed in the extension period. Bizarre situation >Isn't it much simpler to just accept he deserved it, as all of these experts agree?  But he doesn't?   It's like saying Sneijder was more deserving of it compared to Messi in 2010. Just that RM PR was not on Cristiano's side in 2018. As an individual player, Ronaldo was very much ahead of Modric. Rodri was better than Halaand"
"Barcelona needs to alter its DNA. Hansi Flick may be the one to do it. (Long read)","2024-05-26T04:46:10+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1d0tsc6/barcelona_needs_to_alter_its_dna_hansi_flick_may/","The Xavi era is over. The 44 year-old manager, considered by many as the best Spanish player in history, will likely wake up one morning, look back at the past two and a half years, and think ‚ÄúWhat the hell just happened.‚Äù¬†

His journey has been one of constant ups and downs. His appointment as manager fresh from a short managerial stint in Qatar, taking¬† over for Koeman; the both weird and familiar space he found himself as his work started, surrounded by the warmth of the club of his childhood and his life, and at the same time feeling constantly scrutinized by local media, fans, and some of the board.

At the top of the list are the many repercussions he suffered from the actions of president Joan Laporta. He was forced to watch while in charge the saddest of goodbyes to Lionel Messi. Rumors of the board interfering with squad call-ups. The I love you - I love you nots of the past few months of the President, from getting choked up when he said Xavi was staying, to his final decision of firing him with a match to go in La Liga, to everything before and after.

Breaking news: Laporta doesn't seem to love anyone but himself. There is a saying in Spanish; ‚ÄúLa confianza da asco.‚Äù Said in other words, those closest to you will treat you the worst. The neutral Spanish fan who grew up watching Xavi lift a World Cup and back-to-back Euros hopes that in the near future, and regardless of Xavi‚Äôs tactical shortcomings in comparison to Barcelona titans like Luis Enrique or Pep Guardiola, he will find peace, serenity, and room to do the work and succeed. Often, one can only find that away from home.¬†

Whichever way Barcelona arrived here, the sacking of Xavi brings forth Hansi Flick. The German is the second foreign manager out of the past seven at Barcelona, and the first one in 22 years to have never either managed or played in Spain, since Louis van Gaal in 2003. Flick, aware of the interest for months, has been learning Spanish in an effort to bridge the inevitable gap he will feel upon his unveiling.¬†

If only that were the only problem.¬†



**Laporta‚Äôs last bullet**

The appointment of Hansi Flick by Joan Laporta ties both of them at the hip; for a lot of people watching, this is El President‚Äôs last chance to turn things around, especially as other areas of the club, fanbase and financials notoriously, are on a downward spiral.¬†

The Nou Camp Nou is still in shambles, and the dream of playing at home by the end of 2025, no matter what news sources push out, is difficult. In turn, the experience at the Estadi Olimpic has proven to be both good and bad for the club; on one end, the audience watching matches at the temporary stadium are heavily, and more than ever, international fans hoping to see one more attraction, much like the Sagrada Familia Cathedral, or the beach.¬†

On the other end, Barcelona has gotten away with it with a lukewarm season for that same reason. Losses to Paris Saint-Germain (1-4), Real Madrid (1-2), Girona (2-4) and Villarreal (3-5) at home would have set the Camp Nou on fire.

If we focus on the financials, things get worse. The club has partially sold assets out to execute what they called ‚Äúlevers‚Äù that would allow them to tackle last-minute payments, wage bills, and much needed transfers. The situation would be alleviated if the team performed, though. Barcelona was counting on getting close to the Champions League final to bring some much needed revenue in. That did not happen, with the club losing to an extra-inspired Dembele against Paris Saint Germain in the Quarterfinals, 6-4 in aggregate.¬†

Barcelona also failed to qualify to the newly formatted FIFA Club World Club. Much lower-valued clubs like Benfica, Atletico Madrid, or Red Bull Salzburg will attend; but Barcelona did not make the cut‚Äìanother 50 million Euros out of reach. In turn, financial leadership has attempted to distance itself from the wreckage, with moves like Financial Vice President Eduard Romeu, who left two months ago. He is still to be replaced.¬†

As Laporta keeps the plates spinning, he turns to what seems to be the last chance he has to turn the wind in his favor, and in the end, the one thing true Barcelona fans care about most: what happens on the pitch. With the sacking of Xavi and the imminent appointment of Hansi Flick, the President could have placed the last nail on his coffin and opened the door for a successor.

It could also prove to be the best decision Barcelona has made since Guardiola.¬†



**Hansi Flick**

Hansi Flick (1965, Heidelberg) spent the bulk of his playing career at Bayern Munich in the 80s. He averaged 20 matches per season, not standing out but nevertheless being part of the team that won four Bundesligas, first under Udo Lattek then under Jupp Heynckes in what was his first stint out of four for the veteran manager at the German club.¬†

As a Bayern player, he visited Spain twice, both times playing against Real Madrid, and losing both times, in the Champions League final rounds.¬†

Immediately after his retirement, he became manager of lower league FC Bammental, and later and more consistently, TSG Hoffenheim. He managed the club for close to 200 matches, attempting promotion to the German third tier several times, but failing and eventually being sacked on November 19, 2005.¬†

Roughly a thousand miles away, Xavi and company visited the Barnabeu themselves, beating Los Blancos by 0-3 with a Ronaldinho brace, including that run from midfield to dribble half the team, beat Iker Casillas, and get a standing ovation from the rival stadium.The best of times were still to come for Barcelona: 18-year-old Messi was starting to feature.

After that reset, Flick decided to cool down and learn. What followed were stints as an assistant manager at Red Bull Salzburg serving Giovanni Trapattoni in one of the mighty Italian‚Äôs last adventures in 2006. He is only one of seven men to have won the UEFA Champions League as both a player, and a manager.

Most notoriously though, he was later the right hand of Joachim L√∂w in the German National team. The first strokes of Flick‚Äôs abilities as a manager started to shine as part of L√∂w‚Äôs team: aggressiveness in the offensive, physicality, aerial prowess. Set pieces. Largely in charge of the latter for the German side during the 2014 World Cup, Flick proved his worth when elegance-personified-in-football Toni Kroos whipped a cross from a free kick, and Mats Hummels headed past Hugo Lloris to beat France (1-0). Days later, Kroos would join Real Madrid from Bayern Munich.

Flick went on to become the Sporting Director of the national team after they lifted the World Cup, but the bench kept calling him in. By 2019 he was back at work, as assistant manager of Niko Kovac and his Bayern Munich. The Croatian was hoping to build on the Bundesliga title achieved last season, but first players, then fans turned their backs on him as results and performances, individual and at the team level, simply weren‚Äôt good enough. Eintracht Frankfurt beat the German giants 5-1, and Kovac was sacked.¬†

That night in November, Hansi Flick took over as interim manager. Six months later, he would lift the Bundesliga, German Cup and the Champions League trophies. It would be only the second treble in Bayern history.

Flick left at the end of the next season, surrounded by rumors of his relationship with board and key Bayern ex-players, but¬† as one of the most effective managers in Bayern‚Äôs recent memory.¬†

Later on, Germany called, and Flick did not hesitate to say yes; a real chance at being in charge of the national team.

However, that stint did not go well. It did not help that, while in charge, Flick doubted himself.¬†

The next 23 months involved an underwhelming third place at the UEFA Nations League, and three dismal performances at the World Cup, with a loss to Japan (1-2), a tie against Germany (1-1), and a late win to Costa Rica (4-2).¬†

Even though he had plenty of Bayern ex-players at his disposal, Flick simply could not make things work with a team he could not communicate more than a few times a year, man management being one of his fortes. He tried to compensate, as humans often do, in other areas of his own influence. He changed formation over a half dozen times, shying away from his 4-2-3-1. He became aggressive in his communications with players.¬†

The board eventually lost confidence in him.

His style of football though, aggressive, high-block and high-tempo, Flicki-Flacka as it was dubbed back in Munich, is the kind of philosophy Flick will be asked and hope to bring to Barcelona.

The question remains: will he be able to get past language barriers, cultural dissonance, a local media that will not hesitate to attack a foreign, non Barcelona-DNA manager the instant things are not working, and succeed against a well-oiled Real Madrid, likely with Kylian Mbappe in the ranks?¬†

Just as importantly, will Laporta get out of Flick‚Äôs way‚Äìand his own way‚Äìand let the manager do his job?¬†

Will there be enough resources to build a team that will be able to play to the German‚Äôs style?

Some of these questions can be asked by looking at the manager‚Äôs tactical style, and the players at his disposal.



**Flicki-Flacka**

When Flick sticks to what he does best, he proves to be lethal, like at Bayern Munich. His 4-2-3-1 system choked the opposition in his own box, took the ball by storm, and found quick and effective ways to create chances to score.¬†

Ask Barcelona after Flick‚Äôs Bayern demolished the Catalans in 2020 (2-8). It was the Cules biggest loss in 70 years. Barcelona manager Quique Setien was sacked hours later. Pique, Messi and Suarez were vocal in the press about the need for change. Ronald Koeman, the manager who preceded Xavi at Barcelona, took over days later.¬†

Regardless of whether Flick will be able to implement the same system in a country where low-block teams (those that wait in their third of the pitch, defending closely together and hoping for a counter) are more common than in Germany‚Äôs open style of football, some main concepts are expected.¬†

**High pressure, all the time.** Flick is known for wanting to pin the opposition against its own goal, from the 1st to the 90th minute. He keeps rivals off-balance, and refuses to give them the ability to breathe, and build, from the back.¬†

If the opposition does wriggle out of pressure, attacking players are expected to track back and keep pressuring the ball. During his first campaign at Bayern, it was common to watch as Thomas M√ºller stole the ball in the middle of the pitch. The team would then turn on a dime, and a full attack would follow; often with superiority in numbers against a defense struggling to track back. Leroy San√©, Lewandowski, or M√ºller himself would often have a chance to score only seconds later.

**Possession is important, but chance creation trumps.** Flick refuses to speculate with the ball. Think of it as the attacking antithesis of Garcia Pimienta‚Äôs Las Palmas: Flick‚Äôs teams charge up the field, use the flanks, and find through passes, and just as often crosses, to keep pushing and create chances to score. In the 19/20 season, Bayern scored 100 goals in the Bundesliga; 99 goals the season after. Bayern has not matched those numbers since.¬†

**It starts at the back.** Away from some of the most dominating teams in Europe these days, with a midfielder stuck between the two central defenders in order to link up the play, Flick trusts that having two ball-playing defenders will negate the need for a midfielder so far down the pitch, giving them more opportunities to both be closer to and move faster towards goal.¬†

This happened at Bayern as well, with Alaba and Boateng comfortable with the ball, which gave Kimmich and Goretzka freedom to be more involved on the attacking build up; Goretzka would push up higher down the field and join the attack, specially as an aerial threat, and Kimmich would stay slightly back and bring creative ways to restart the attack, send in a cross or a through pass, or take a shot.

**Crosses are sexy.** Expect a lot of crossing at Barcelona, especially if Flick develops the squad he will be hoping to build. The German prioritizes the flanks over the midfield in his style of play; incisive, fast players are non-negotiable, as well as a striker and an attacking midfielder who are both comfortable in the air, and able to play with their back to the goal to create chances for the wingers.¬†

Behind them all, the right and left fullbacks take turns charging up the field, with one of them likely staying back and into a three-player defense (a style that Manchester City has mastered), and the other one pushing further up. When the game requires an unlock via a deep cross or a run into space, the other fullback will be asked to push up as well.

**Conceding goals is acceptable.** Such a style of play, pushing so high up the field without reservations, leaves plenty of space at the back between the defense and the goalkeeper. As it was the case with Bayern (the 2-3 loss to Paris Saint Germain in 2021 being a good example of this), ultra-pressure comes at a cost, and teams with the ability to counter quickly and with skill will find plenty of opportunities to score.¬†

**Players may change position.** Hansi Flick‚Äôs decisions around who to play and where regardless of their experience to date have impacted a lot of high-profile players now considered the best at what they do. Canadian superstar Alphonso Davies was slowly growing as a winger before Flick exploded him into one of the best left backs in the world. David Alaba turned into a world class center back after being pulled out of that left back position; and world-class talent Kimmich, known for being a positional chameleon with a brain to match, is shining as a defensive midfielder, He was an established right back when Flick took over.¬†

The German will look at players and be, in theory, unafraid to make decisions that land them in different positions. This could prove a problem with some of the traditional fanbase, who could turn to these situations when things don‚Äôt work out..¬†

**Setting expectations, man management, and physicality.** Aside from the tactical aspect of his management in his career so far, Hansi Flick demands a communication style that is open and daily, forging relationships with players that will render the performance he needs out of them on the pitch. This could prove difficult in Spain for the first time in charge of a team that broadly does not speak his native language. It‚Äôs the reason other coaches like Simeone struggle to leave Spain, or why Unai Emery is often seen tripping over his words as his passion for what he is saying catches up to his domain of the English language. Making insightful, elaborated points in a non-native tongue is hard. This is likely the reason why news outlets are reporting that Flick and Barcelona are already looking to land Spanish-and-German speaking players who could act as the extension of the manager in the locker, like Thiago Alcantara.

Regardless of the potential language troubles, Flick will overall deploy a style of play that will be clear, specific, and especially after the national team failure, immovable. In Muller‚Äôs words while at Bayern: ‚ÄúHe tells us what to do with consistency and without alternatives. We know what the player next to us is doing‚Äù.¬†

This will likely be a breath of fresh air compared to the exiting manager; even though Xavi stuck to the 4-3-3 style Barcelona die-hard fans demand, the way in which the tactic was deployed was often lacking in shape, purpose or consistency, and often turning into a ball for Raphinha or Lamine Yamal to save the day.

Lastly but equally importantly, Hansi Flick demands that his players are in top physical shape, and if possible, increase their muscle size in order to increase their aggressiveness, pressuring abilities, and aerial superiority. During the COVID outbreak, several Bayern players notoriously put on muscle in the forced break, with some of them looking close to unrecognizable. Coutinho notoriously put on four kilograms (9lbs) of muscle.¬†

If players like Pedri, Yamal, or Cubarsi join the fitness plan, Barcelona could benefit from it in the long term‚Äìespecially when looking at the injury list year after year.¬†



**Aligning Flick's system with Barcelona's current squad**

When imagining what Flick‚Äôs Barcelona could look like, some players stand out. First is the old guard, the players the German manager has coached in the past. They will prove invaluable both in the integration of the manager, and in the implementation of¬† his system.¬†

That list includes Robert Lewandowski, who is likely to play a Bayern‚Äôs Lewa/Muller hybrid role next season, scoring but also assisting plenty, as well as benefiting from set pieces and crosses. Ter Stegen was part of Flick‚Äôs German team as well, and with Neuer at Barcelona, the goalkeeper will continue to enjoy the spotlight as a ball-player goalkeeper.¬†

Same is the case with G√ºndoƒüan, who Flick managed in the national team.The midfielder,¬† about to turn 34, has the qualities needed, especially if we look at the need to perform, now. G√ºndoƒüancertainly has a year or two left in his career; this season, he led Barcelona in progressive carries of the ball and recoveries as well, and is the current free-kick specialist.¬†

There are also those who have not played under Flick yet, but align with his style of play, at least on paper. That includes, above all, Lamine Yamal. His style of play is perfect for the job Flick will want him to perform, and if Flick‚Äôs fitness plans follow, we could be in the midst of a supernova of a player.¬†¬†

Other players, like Gavi, theoretically fit right into Flick‚Äôs system. The 19 year-old‚Äôs ability to be physical sometimes to a fault, his technique, and his attacking abilities will prove a great addition to the starting midfielders on paper, de Jong and Gundogan. If he comes back after his injury on a good note, we could see the best version of Gavi yet.¬†

In defense, one player stands out: Jules Kounde. The Parisian has the passing ability and physicality Flick loves, and could prove a great anchor at the back, as well as an aerial threat. It may be that the defender could have the chance he has been waiting for to finally get the recognition he deserves from his fans.¬†

Ronald Araujo is flawless in the air, on defense and attack, but constant transfer rumors originating from Barcelona hint at the club wanting a big influx of revenue to square the finances up. Flick could see in Cubarsi Barcelona‚Äôs Kimmich, being placed in different roles across the pitch and perhaps eventually being placed in midfield. The 17-year-old is certainly displaying mental abilities foreign to someone who is still unable to vote in an election in Spain.

Ferran Torres and Raphinha will need to change a lot of things about the way they play in order to gain the trust of the manager; specially defensively. On the sidelines is Vitor Roque, who especially in this system, would seem to be lost at sea, although the 19 year old still has so much room to grow.¬†

Regardless of current players, there will be a need for new players over the summer. Laporta will likely not be able to find the funds for it unless players exit first. The return of Eric Garcia, on loan from Girona, could prove a good addition at the back, especially after the ball-playing defender‚Äôs amazing season at the neighboring club, including five goals scored in La Liga.¬†

If Villarreal‚Äôs Alex Baena or Girona‚Äôs Aleix Garcia join the team, they would both fit right into this system; the first one behind Lewandowski, and the second one, playing with de Jong or Gundogan. Some aspects of their game, like Aleix‚Äôs switch to pushing forward over helping back, or Baena‚Äôs seemingly innate ability to earn uncalled for yellow cards when frustrated, will have to be worked on.

In the horizon, and as an almost unobtainable wish, stand players like Kimmich, himself, Davies, or young talent Jamal Musiala. The Bayern Munich player, who made his professional debut at age 17 under Hansi Flick, would be the kind of transfer the German manager would have made if he had just joined Manchester City or Real Madrid.

Not in Barcelona. In Xavi's own words, ‚ÄúThe present situation has nothing to do with 25 years ago. The manager would come and say ‚ÄúI want this player, this one, and this one.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt work like that anymore.‚Äù¬†

Whatever the situation, Flick has landed in Barcelona, and the challenge is one that will make or break him, and Laporta, by extension. If he can find a way to get past politics, language, media, emotional turmoil, financial instability, a cold stadium, and all other things Barcelona, he will be seen as a genius, and Laporta, as a mastermind.¬†

It will all come down to whether this club can stop chasing whatever version of ‚ÄúBarcelona DNA'' is out there in 2024, and whether they can let Flick bring some of his own DNA to an organization that historically prides itself on hanging on to the past.","79","Vila-real","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1d0tsc6/barcelona_needs_to_alter_its_dna_hansi_flick_may/","**The OP has marked this post as Original Content (OC).

Plus, hope Xavi takes some time to rest, I'm curious what his next stop will be and how will he evolve Good read. I feel like post like this are so much more rare on this sub but thanks for you insight. Will be interesting for sure to see if he works out  I have a feeling he may succeed although we have to think about that barca is competing with the best team in world with the top 3 best players of the world in their team. If Flick doesnt work out, then it means Laporta is gone fot sure.  I want Laporta out but I hope Flick is a success  I still feel Xavi was doing a good job.  Its time for Laporta to leave. Finally,  an interesting original content Flick is Barca DNA. Barca's football was always control the game through the ball and regain it as soon as possible, extreme mental and physical intensity, strict trainings to improve speed and resistance. These were the principles of Guardiola's Barca. And are basically the same principles of Flick's Bayern and any other modern German coach, a bit more direct or a bit less direct are just details. Even Bayern CEO at the time of Flick claimed ""Flick is tactically the same as Guardiola and Van Gaal"".  Modern German football and Barca DNA (Dutch football) nowadays are almost indistinguishable. German football has evolved so much in the direction of Guardiola that it seems almost excessive to call them two different styles. Observe Flick's Bayern or Klopp's Liverpool in recent seasons, now they have very high possession rates, now they press all over the pitch instead of just their own half. This is modern German football. Looking at modern teams people don't even know, I don't know myself, if you watch for example Ten Hag's Ajax, if he played Barca's football or German football.  And if you consider the modern footballer is becoming more and more complete, I think in 20 years Barca DNA and German DNA will be the exact same thing.  What I know is that when Barca tried to do something completely different in recent years (Valverde and Koeman) it worked much worse for us. Koeman was a stern defender that ""tiki taki"" as he used to despectively call it was obsolete. Valverde also sold us the tactical revolution of parking the bus against teams like Betis and trust Messi will score in the counter attack. I think Messi himself defended Valverde's tactics and claimed it was the tactical revolution. But time seems to have proved them wrong. >On the sidelines is Vitor Roque, who especially in this system, would seem to be lost at sea, although the 17 year old still has so much room to grow.¬†  So the current 19-year-old has gone from being called an 18-year-old to now being called a 17-year-old.  In the next month, he will be called a 16-year-old > Raphinha will need to change a lot of things about the way they play in order to gain the trust of the manager; specially defensively.  Wut. Good read. It will be interesting to see how Hansi Flick's Barca turn out to be.  Above all, I wish him the best. I'd like to see him succeed after his abysmal tenure with the NT. Amazing post I copy [from the Bar√ßa sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Barca/s/XzpSjrrKLz). I don‚Äôt know how OP concluded this. Bar√ßa DNA is not some Reddit users think it is. It is an extremely demanding system. Really interesting reading. Is hard to find original content like this here. I didn't read any of that, if any of that helps barcelona then I don't want it to happen tho Xavi didn't deserve to get sacked, he just won the league last season and this season half his good players were injured and he still managed to get them to the quarter final. They could have gone to semis easily if araujo didn't screw up. Good read! Fermin also is, I believe, another Gavi hybrid that I think will flourish under Flick. good read as a Barca fan im looking positively to the new season to see what Flick has to offer. Jesus fucking wall of text ü§£  All I gotta say is I always respected Xavi as a player, never thought he's this huge of a moron as per his constant bitching and general dumb statements in media as a coach. Thanks for the feedback. It's interesting,  this is basically an article I have written exclusively for reddit in the style of things you'd read in The Athletic etc,  but I just don't think people here like that. It's been an interesting experiment to do, I think the amount of downvotes and the total upvotes in general tell me I shouldn't bother. And I don't mean this in a bad way, just in a factual way--this took about five hours. Sorry, typo. Thanks. The 15 year old seems to be getting younger and younger Raphinha is one of the best attackers defensively.his dribbling and decisions might be shit sometimes but he is excellent defensively Thanks! I don't think I'll do it again here based on the reception but it was fun to work on! There a lot of madrid fans nowadays on this sub who downvote everything which has barca in.  I am sure that if you changed the name of barca to arsenal you would have get a lot more upvotes.  English tax of this sub + madrid fans not downvoting your post  Anyway you shouldnt take it personally. It is great work I'm a Madrid fan and I think you did a good job with this article! I will be following Barcelona next season to see if Flick can deliver the changes that you mentioned! Hope you have a great season ahead Unironically, this is the Benzema story too. The person in that alleged crime was 16 or 17 but was never 15 at the time it was said to have occurred. If you enjoy analyzing football and writing about it, don‚Äôt mind too much what people here think. Just do it and post it, some people will find it interesting for sure! Appreciate it üëç Yeah it's kind of discouraging seeing a 40% downvote rate and don't get me wrong, I still write and post in my other channels, but I guess yeah, I can post here and whoever wants to read can üëç Well, you know, talking about Bar√ßa right now is not very popular here. Lot of karma farmers. Anyway, good job! Hahahha yep"

I am not sure why this is the case but most of the La Liga business happens in the week leading upto the season opener plus first week of the league and 2nd and 3rd weeks of the league right before the window closes meaning the last 2-3 weeks of the window. You would assume nobody is making a transfer and then all of sudden you see a random club bringing in on average 12 new players in the last 2 weeks of the window while the league has started.  Also La Liga teams are slow to peak cause they start the pre-seasons very late compared to other leagues and the average date where all La Liga teams are in super physical condition is first around the beginning of october.  That is why you see sometimes Sevilla getting into trash mode in the first of half of the season involved in relegation battle then slowly turn into a team of titans in the second half of the season going undefeated and unstoppable in that period Endrick, Mbappe and who? Is Espanyol struggling with FFP too? Surprised that Real Madrid is the team that signed least Free, besides the ~‚Ç¨125m signing bonus. Hey at least we didn't pay the oil merchants The Prem is the opposite Most Premier League teams peak early August even before the league begins. Arsenal is a great example they start pre-season 1st july and by the end of July they are in super peak physical condition like UCL final ready physical condition they bury teams coming to visit on the weekend before the premier league opener in the Emirates cup and I mean like 6-0, 7-1 etc etc Joselu was transferred in, then sold out Leny yoro. Isnt that the usual? Madid rarely need to buy more players I thought it was 150m, 50m yearly for 3 seasons? Tho majority of the opponents in the Emirates cup aren¬¥t in peak physical condition like maybe just 20-30% in shape tho Arsenal has to get quickly in shape because they want majority of the time ahead start on city this year they didn¬¥t succeded to get one as city started aswell early [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/03/real-madrid-sign-kylian-mbappe-psg) I was reading just says ‚Ç¨125m spread over 5 years, not sure if it's evenly spread out or not.

**The Quick Hits:**

* You want new kits, I got some [new kits](https://ligue1.fr/fr/articles/l1_article_131-les-maillots-de-la-saison-2024-2025-l1). What about all the transfers, got [those too.](https://ligue1.fr/articles/mercato)
* On those lists is St Etienne, who is back to their rightful place in France after a 116' minute goal in the relegation playoffs against Metz. They're joined by the once feared Ligue 1 foe, Auxerre, who after a decade of Ligue 2 play, is on their second trip up to Ligue 1 and hoping this one will last more than one season. Also Angers, a more regular visitor to Ligue 1, on their first trip up to the top flight since 2015
* Even with two less teams (or maybe specifically because of 2 less teams), Ligue 1 beat the attendance record last season. 8.27 million fans made their way to the stadiums, which turned into a +14% increase in average attendance. Who even needs a big media deal?!
* Despite the season kicking off today, Lille have already grabbed headlines with a late late game winner in Champions League qualifiers against Fenerbahce.
* Joining Lille in the Champions League is Brest, who are so small and overachieved so much last season that they're now looking for a stadium to play their Champions League matches in, with their current stadium being... just in general, too old and small. Instead les pirates are looking to play in Ligue 2 Guingamp's stadium.
* We don't talk about Bordeaux. If you've been living under a rock all summer, Bordeaux shows what happens when you mix bad owners with a pandemic, as they were blasted all they way down to National 2 (Fourth tier).
* Not enough jersey talk, here's a historical look and a stylist's opinion on current French teams with [striped jerseys. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P4n7MdNBBA)



**What to watch instead of PSG?** Tired of watching the mega giant Parisians walk to another Ligue victory? Let's give you something else you can be more entertained by. This week, PSG kick off the Ligue today with an uninspiring clash with Le Havre. But why watch that when you could watch another Parisian team kick off a ligue a half hour earlier? Red Star are back up in Ligue 2 and kicking off their season against Amiens. Amiens finished in the middle of the table last season, so this might be a good measuring stick for how well Red Star will hold up in the higher division.

\~ Takumi Minamino on Ligue 1

*""A very insufficient season! I think Farioli's style of play didn't help him and didn't suit him in terms of his qualities. Waiting for the ball in front of the box is not his style at all. We will see with Franck Haise but I think he is a trainer capable of getting him back in the saddle.""*

\~ Frederic Piquionne on Terem Moffi's previous season

*‚ÄúThe people of Marseille define OM as the most important club in the country, but we need to bring back enthusiasm and challenge the dominance of Paris Saint Germain.* *I will tell the players that we must make the fans proud.

"Liverpool legend to get financial support from club after Alzheimer's diagnosis","2024-01-06T00:19:00+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/18zm76k/liverpool_legend_to_get_financial_support_from/","‚ÄúLiverpool legend Ron Yeats is living with Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease, the club have announced.

The 86-year-old joined the Reds from Aberdeen in 1961 and would go on to make 454 appearances during 10 years with the club. Regarded as one of Bill Shankly‚Äôs greatest signings the Scot famously christened his compatriot a ‚Äòcolossus‚Äô and encouraged journalists to ‚Äòwalk around him,‚Äô when unveiling the centre-back.

Yeats‚Äô family recently reached out to Forever Reds, the club's official former players association. And after raising over ¬£75,000 for good causes and ex-players at the annual Forever Reds Christmas lunch last month, a donation is to be made in support of the former Liverpool captain.

Forever Reds chairman and ECHO columnist John Aldridge said: ‚ÄúSituations like Ron‚Äôs are exactly why we created Forever Reds and wanted to continue to support former players who need our help.

‚ÄúTo be able to support him and his family through this difficult time is what being part of the LFC family is all about. I loved to watch Ron play and his contribution to this club will never be forgotten.

‚ÄúThank you to all the fans who join us in our events and help us raise funds to support our former players. It‚Äôs an incredible amount to be able to support the Forever Reds and local causes.‚Äù

Speaking about the support her family has received from Forever Reds, Ron‚Äôs wife Ann said: ‚ÄúThis donation has been a lifeline, the family and I are incredibly thankful for the support. When I put in the call to the club and spoke to them, I was overwhelmed by the response.

‚ÄúAlzheimer‚Äôs is a difficult disease and it‚Äôs often the families who suffer the most because of the emotional and financial impact. We can‚Äôt thank Forever Reds enough for what they have done for Ron.‚Äù

Yeats led Liverpool to FA Cup glory for the first time in 1965, and, having won the Second Division in 1961/62, also lifted two First Division titles in 1963/64 and 1965/66.

Leaving the club in 1971, he returned as chief scout under Kenny Dalglish in 1986. Remaining in that role until his retirement in May 2006, he was responsible for scouting club legend Sami Hyypia, amongst countless others, with the Finn regarded as one of his finest finds.

Meanwhile, Yeats was voted 29th in the official Liverpool website poll '100 Players Who Shook The Kop', and was made an 'Honorary Scouser' by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool in April 2009. And in 2015, along with Ian St. John, he received a lifetime achievement award from the club.‚Äù

He has already proven that several times this season, also against opponents of stature.""  **From PSV Academy**  Isaac Babadi came to PSV Academy at the age of twelve, where he made his debut in professional football in 2022 at Young PSV. Last season he played thirty games in the Keuken Kampioen Divisie. In those, he scored five goals. On August 4, 2023, Isaac made his official debut for the main squad in the Johan Cruijff Schaal. Since then, the creative was in action seventeen games for PSV 1. In February, he made minutes in every league game and scored his first Eredivisie goal. Well one transfer saga is over. Onto the Mbappe one now FM sleeper"
"Football Teams Who Are Defying Expectations in 23/24. PT 2: VFB Stuttgart","2024-02-23T19:16:11+00:00","https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ay90w1/football_teams_who_are_defying_expectations_in/","The only thing better than seeing your favorite club succeed is hearing about a club that is punching way above their weight and defying the expectations that were given to them As a Chelsea fan, I have to rely on looking at these Cinderella stories to give myself some joy. I've started a series where I'll write about teams around the world that you might not have known are having incredible seasons.  Many write up's have been done about Girona and Leverkusen, so I wanted other teams to get some love as well. The series will continue with Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. Disclaimer: While I spent hours researching these teams, I can't promise 100% accuracy. If you are a fan of the club or league I'm writing about, please provide additional insights and corrections in the comments. 

# 2.  VFB Stuttgart (Bundesliga, 3rd place, 46 pts, 2 pts off 2nd)

**A Brief Background**

Although several other teams are having incredible seasons in the Bundesliga (Leverkusen, Werder Bremen, Heidenheim,) one of the most impressive tales of the 23/24 season has to be VFB Stuttgart's unexpected push for Champions League football. Stuttgart is a club with a lot of history in German football, having picked up 5x Bundesliga titles and several other [trophies.](https://www.transfermarkt.com/vfb-stuttgart/erfolge/verein/79) However, their recent fortunes have not been as good. The club has spent several seasons in the second tier, and has mostly been in the bottom half of the table since [2010.](https://www.transfermarkt.com/vfb-stuttgart/platzierungen/verein/79) Last season, it seemed that Stuttgart could be relegated for the third time in 8 years, but they managed to comfortably beat Hamburg in the relegation playoffs. 

**Season Expectations and Current Performance**

Best wins:

Stuttgart 2-1 Dortmund, Nov 11, 2023, Bundesliga

Stuttgart 2-0 Dortmund, Dec 6, 2023, DBF Pokal R16

Stuttgart 5-2 Leipzig,  Jan 27, 2023, Bundesliga

After finishing in 15th in 21/22, and then 16th in 22/23, Stuttgart fans did not have high hopes going into the 2023 summer transfer window.  If any hope was present, it was swiftly gone after Stuttgart sold 3 key players: Kostas Mavropanos, Borna Sosa, and especially club Icon Wataru Endo. The replacements were seen as downgrades, so the expectations for Stuttgart were low. At best, people suggested Stuttgart would finish mid-table. Others thought that the club would be battling against relegation, and had a reasonable chance of going down. What nobody predicted was Stuttgart challenging for a Champions League place.  After picking up 46 points from 22 games, Stuttgart find themselves 6 points clear of 5th place Leipzig (Top 4 is UCL), and are 13 points clear of 6th. In addition, they are extremely easy on the eye, are the 3rd highest-scoring team with 51 goals, and are not bad defensively. Their [wage budge](https://www.capology.com/de/1-bundesliga/payrolls/)t places them in 9th compared to other Bundesliga teams, and they made a profit of 28 million over the two windows. It is extremely likely Stuttgart will be in Europe, despite losing these key players. How did they do it?

**The Keys to Success**

Stuttgart has an extremely passionate fanbase. The stadium is almost always packed, and they average 53,518 fans per home game. This is 4th highest in the Bundesliga. Stuttgart makes this hostile and passionate atmosphere count, because they have won 9, drawn 1, and lost 1 at home. In other terms, that is 28 points from a possible 33. Because of manager Sebastian Hoeness's entertaining, high press, and attacking system, fans have even more motivation to come out and attendance continues to rise. 

&#x200B;

Sebastian Hoeness's pressing system has also been instrumental to the team's success. After some good spells with Bayern's youth teams, the young manager was definitely on the radar of several Bundesliga teams. Although his prior spell at Hoffenheim did not go perfectly, his philosophy has certainly shined at Stuttgart. As I don't regularly watch Stuttgart games, I am hesitant to go into in-depth tactics, but [here,](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/tactics-analysis-serhou-guirassy-deniz-undav-vfb-stuttgart-25539) [here,](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/competitions/bundesliga/bundesliga-202324-stuttgart-bayer-leverkusen-tactical-preview-analysis-tactics) and [here](https://theanalyst.com/eu/2023/10/stuttgart-transformation-from-relegation-battle-to-title-challenge/) are some articles for those interested. I also would love to hear about this side of things from Stuttgart fans below. 

**The Regular Players**

**Alexander Nubel: (GK) (27)** Unfortunately, Nubel has not hit the mark of ""Next Neuer"" and has had a rough time since leaving Schalke. Nubel is currently on loan from Bayern, and has had a solid season in goal. Perhaps this will restart a once-promising career.

**Hiroki Ito (CB/LB) (24)** Although he has missed some time due to injury, Ito has been a mainstay piece in the Stuttgart defense for 3 seasons and looks better each season. Now valued at 22 million euros, Hiroki was signed from the 2nd tier of Japan for just 400k. We love a bargain.

**Waldemar Anton (CB) (27) (C)** Waldemar is everything you would want from a captain. He is a leader, he has started every single league match, and is a very good player. Waldemar joined for 4 million in 2020 and was able to revive his career. Waldemar Anton is eligible for the Uzbekistan national team, and it would have been cool to see him choose this path.

**Dan-Axel Zagadou (CB) (24)** Once considered a wonderkid,  Zagadou has seen his career plagued by injuries. After having a solid start to the season, he unfortunately tore his cruciate ligament and will be out for the rest of the season

**Maximilian Mittelstadt (LB) (26)** A bit of an FM legend in the past, Max has been solid as an LB since signing for 500k in the summer from Hertha. He has 2 goals and 2 assists on the season

**Pascal Stenzel (RB) (27)** Pascal has also been a good choice as an attacking RB, and he has provided 5 assists for Stuttgart. He is currently suspended after being sent off in the 45+22nd minute against Darmstadt

**Angelo Stiller (CDM) (22)**  Stiller is a ""Sebastian Hoeness player"" because he has played for him at the Bayern youth level, at Hoffeheim, and in Stuttgart. Their 3rd collaboration has proven to be extremely successful and Stiller has been one of Stuttgart's best players this season. He has helped fill a void that many thought could not be filled with Endo's departure

**Atakan Karazor (CDM) (27)** Karazor has been an ever-present force alongside Stiller and seems to be one of those glue guys who just put out solid performances on a consistent basis.

**Enzo Millot (AM) (21**) Although lacking a bit of consistency, Millot has turned out to be one of those youth player punts that struck gold. After being signed from Monaco for 1.75 million in 2021, He's now worth over 20 million and has contributed 4 goals and 6 assists in all competitions for Stuttgart.

**Chris Fuhrich (LW) (26)** A contender for Stuttgart's best player of the season, Fuhrich has contributed 6 goals and 6 assists in 22 matches. He's instrumental to their system, and Guirassy certainly wouldn't have as many goals without him. Chris's impressive performances have earned him a call- up to the German national team

**Jamie Leweling (RW) (22)** Perhaps the surprise player of the season, Leweling has taken Silas's spot on the right wing and has been quite impressive as of late. 

**Deniz Undav (ST) (27)** Incredibly, Stuttgart has 2 of the best strikers in the Bundesliga. Undav, who was signed as a rotational option after not impressing at Brighton, has 14 goals and 5 assists in 19 matches. He has been deadly, and picked up a Bundesliga player of the month award for January 2024. Unfortunately, he is out with injury at the moment.

**Serhou Guirassy (ST) (27)** The man that so many people have talked about, Guirassy has been one of the best strikers in the world this season. During the peak of his form, he was seriously pulling off some incredible plays. Although he has slightly slowed down as of late, he still has 18 goals in 16 games. This still puts him as the 4th highest scorer behind Lautaro Martinez, Mbappe, and Harry Kane. 

&#x200B;

The lethal attack that Stuttgart possesses is certainly the most important part of the team, but it is quite a balanced squad. I hope that this historic team can pull of a CL finish, and continue to build from there. To me, I have always seen them as a ""sleeping giant"", and I have wished them well ever since I had a fun FM save there in 2019.

If I could add one thing, I'd be that our stadium is currently undergoing renovations for the Euros. That's why the stadium isn't at the full 60k capacity.
