Good luck to him. Why are all of the comments here talking about his pressing as if he didn‚Äôt bag 22 G/A last season Do Bournemouth have a replacement already? 20% sell-on clause for Liverpool I'm a little sad because I enjoyed tuning into Bournemouth last season thanks to Iraola ball and Solanke absolutely balling out. But it's a great move for him, and hopefully, Bournemouth has a good replacement for him Good signing for Spurs, I'm looking forward to another season af Ange-ball.   It's a big blow for Bournemouth though. They're a solid side but who's going to score now? This is a good signing I don't want it to happen Depending on the transfer fee, would be a very good get for Spurs, he's a pressing demon Two Orny bombs in quick succession i think this is a great move for both solanke and tottenham.  one thing it's making me wonder about though, is how/why toney isn't getting any traction in the transfer window at all??? am i missing something, because it feels like tottenham definitely could've gone for him instead. arguments can also be made for the likes of arsenal, chelsea and man united who also could've taken a crack at signing him (chelsea before having signed omorodion and united before bringing zirkzee in). So....whats the fee? Nice competition for richarlison to regain form Good signing Let Big Ange cook. Love his football and Spurs were really needing a quality striker when Richarlison was out injured cause Son is not a striker at all Solid transfer if it were to happen imo. Bournemouth get a nice fee and Spurs have a striker they will be able to count on to do well. I normally just want to make fun of Tottenham but this is a very good move for all parties.   Perfect step up in level for Solanke, and if he proves he's got a real sustained top end in him for his peak years he'll help keep Tottenham up and around top 4 too. What has this world turned into when Duncan Castles is the first to report transfers‚Ä¶ Bonkers if its the price reported but a very good fit for Ange‚Äòs press regardless. Great signing I think he‚Äôs a good player, but he does seem to have a touch of Dominic Calvert-Lewin about him.   19 goals in the Premier League last season was really good, but clearly an outlier when you see his previous stats when he‚Äôs played in the league 0, 3 & 6 prior to that and 1 at Liverpool.   I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be very good under Postecoglu, but that does seem excessive for such low returns elsewhere. Can see him bagging 20 goals this season This is a far better deal than buying 5 players for 20 odd million with one of them bound to be good in 2029. Nah, I'd win. The fact that this sort of fee is the ‚Äúgoing rate‚Äù is evidence enough that the ‚Äúgoing rate‚Äù for PL players is absolutely bananas.   1 good season at the top level at age 26 and you‚Äôre in the top 50 most expensive players of all time. English football has collectively lost its head. Good news to see at 4 am I feel this is gonna be another benteke to Liverpool All good.  This will sound a little wild but, the longer this window goes on, the lower the price for Ivan Toney gets - he is the last year of contract, Brentford have to sell and Toney wants a big club.  Subject to what happens with Richy, Toney might get within Levy's price range ... Remmber, with this stadium, Tottenhm/Levy are desperate to to compete deep into 3 cup comps: given  the number of Europa matches, a 55 game season possible.  I even think Solomon > Eze is still possible. Big Dom the anime protagonist Just breathed a huge sigh of relief that we don't have to play against a healthy Pedro Neto the opening weekend. I love Ornsteins reporting so much more than Romano‚Äôs. To the point, clear, doesn‚Äôt throw his own spin on things. That's Bournemouth screwed this season, his goals carried them last season. Only being ""good' for one season is probably a niggling worry for Spurs, but the eye test last season also showed he was a pretty big threat, at least in Bournemouth's current system. If he can replicate that, could be ... gooder I can‚Äôt really gain a decent understanding on him, can any Bournemouth fans tell us what sort of player we‚Äôre getting? Is he worth the fee? Lunacy Villa and Spurps buying great players, meanwhile I am a Chelsea fan. RIP. I understand our signings, but it's frustrating as a fan. Underwhelmed but striker market is dogshit Apparently Dom is a gooner. Not sure how that works out. Holy shit ornstein is on fire! By god it's Michael Edwards song Big big shoes to fill. Will Bournemouth sign somone or rely on Enes Unal? perfect time to cash in i reckon.   solanke is decent, but not 65m decent. the value was in a large part created by iraola and how he had you playing. Sorry for your loss. What sort of player are we getting? I admittedly have barely seen him in action and highlight reels don‚Äôt really give a realistic view point. Fancy a nice little archer, for a bargain price of 30 mil. I guess no guarantee he can replicate the numbers, but if he presses well that‚Äôs what Spurs are getting at a minimum I think the concern amongst Spurs fans is last season is literally the only time he's ever done that (in the PL). Bournemouth play so much to his strengths and everything goes through him and if he's a smaller cog in a big Spurs machine he might not have as much luck. Personally I think it's a mental fee for a good but fairly limited player. He's actually older than you think (27 in a few weeks) as well, so it's not like there's going to that much room for development. For fuckin Bournemouth no less People think of him as the Solanke that Bournemouth overpaid for. There is also the fact that players outside of the top six clubs are still generally looked down upon by many. I mean, its not really that impressive per 90 wise. He‚Äôs hitting a goal or assist every 150 minutes. Hell, Neal Maupay hit that number last season as well. Its just he was ever present last season. Not saying availability doesn‚Äôt matter but injuries can still happen and he‚Äôs going to have more competition for gametime than at bournemouth.  And imo, his all round stats are mid at best and kind of bad at worst I think he‚Äôs good but that was one season That‚Äôs when you know he isn‚Äôt that good Because pressing is the new buzzword in football nowadays.  Fuck if a striker can do what he was meant to do, while also being to link up with players.  They should press better than anything else! /s Heard fans saying Unal would step up and they were being linked to El Bilal Toure yesterday Yeah Unal was brought in with half an eye on this happening. We have signed Daniel Jebbinson on a free from Sheffield as more depth but we will definitely be in the market for another striker now. We might have someone for them. Half of that to get a guaranteed 10+ g/a season from a homegrown striker hmmm it's kind of amazing how the fee we sold him for was mocked at the time as in we ripped off Bournemouth and also ruined the player and I think it was a deal where every single party ended up happy, including Solanke  so that's around 12 million? [https://x.com/davidlynchlfc/status/1821856777861837092](https://x.com/davidlynchlfc/status/1821856777861837092)    ...("" This would net Liverpool ¬£7.6m thanks to the 20% sell-on clause they negotiated in the deal that took Solanke to Bournemouth. "") Its profit clause, so only applied to the amount above what Bournemouth paid to Liverpool. So around ¬£13M if Spurs pay the RC then. Even if his transfer is debatably inflated...Solanke deserves huge respect for his career renaissance.   Guy was a meme, couldn't finish for shit, even his touch and build up was mocked. People said he had *no good attributes* whatsoever, and the ¬£10m Bournemouth paid for him was a waste.   Now he's going to be on lists of the most expensive strikers of all time. Just tune into Spurs this year ü§åüèº I think Unal will be fine I assume it's in the 57-65m range. If he repeats last season it'd be a good buy, and he fits Ange's system. One of the Spurs pods was discussing whether someone with Solanke‚Äôs profile is a better fit for our system than maybe a more gifted striker with a worse profile fit   Either way, he seems like a less chaotic Richarlison who‚Äôs a bit more technical. He‚Äôs apparently a jerk with attitude issues and high wage demands so no one wants to touch him. In addition to the attitude problems everyone else has commented, there's a chance that clubs dont want to risk paying for him and then finding out he's fallen back off the gambling wagon. No one wants to run that risk for an expensive player - the Tonali situation really fucked Newcastle's season last year. >Igor Thiago, signed to be the striker‚Äôs replacement, is set to be out until the end of the year after sustaining a meniscus injury in [pre-season] 5-2 win over AFC Wimbledon. His attitude has been a huge problem. Big clubs interview him and do not like what they hear. No one wants him even at a cut price fee The article mentions a ¬£65M clause ‚Äúfor certain clubs‚Äù but it‚Äôs not clear if it applies to Spurs Probably around ¬£60m Around 60M including addons [\[POK\] Tottenham have agreed to pay Bournemouth ¬£57m for Dominic Solanke with ¬£30m up-front. Some minor add-ons on top of that figure of approximately ¬£3m. Working to complete the deal for striker they who desperately wants to come #THFC : r/coys (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1enw2wv/pok_tottenham_have_agreed_to_pay_bournemouth_57m/) ¬£57m plus ¬£3m add-ons, with ¬£30m paid up front, [according to a reliable Tier 1 for Spurs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/s/QgZQDPXeTy) Richarlison played well when he was fit. Really good goals to minutes ratio.  The issue is that he started off the season unfit, needed an operation. Got fit, scored goals, then got injured again.  Hopefully this signing means his minutes can be managed better and he can continue to improve. Unless Solanke gets injured, Richarlison is riding the pine indefinitely Blink twice if you've been kidnapped mate Son at striker cost us a fuckton last season, not his fault, just that teams figured it out way worryingly quickly I didn't love it for 65, but if it's 50-55 I think that's what the going rate is these days. What wouldn't be bonkers in terms of price? 40m is like the base price for any half decent HG English player these days I was ridiculed in my group chat for saying this price implies Watkins is worth about ¬£100m, but to me Watkins is roughly that much better than Solanke. Am I going mad?! >I think he‚Äôs a good player, but he does seem to have a touch of Dominic Calvert-Lewin about him.   Not really, for one he can stay fit  >19 goals in the Premier League last season was really good, but clearly an outlier when you see his previous stats when he‚Äôs played in the league 0, 3 & 6 prior to that and 1 at Liverpool.   Including 4 & 5 seasons ago when he's had multiple good goalscoring seasons since then is a bit odd, even if a couple were in the championship. 6 goals was in a newly promoted team too in a season where our football was defensive survival football.   Your comments are classic person looking at just stats entirely without context. He has improved every single year he has played for us, last season is the culmination of that and expect it to continue I think he needed those two seasons in the Championship to work on the fundamentals of his game. I watched  a Bournemouth Youtube channel which said that Gary O'Neil didn't play a style which suited Solanke in 22/23, hence his poor goal return. Iraola plays a style much more similar to Ange, so there's hope he can pick up from where he left off without having to adjust his game too much.     Either way, without putting too much pressure on him 15 league goals would be a decent target I think for a first season with us, and then push on from there. Just ignore the 44 goals he scored in the championship. He scored 19 last season so this isn‚Äôt a risky prediction lol 10 at the Emirates, 10 at home against Arsenal Yeah, could go either way. Being good in a lower ranked team doesnt always translate to a higher one in the PL. Players like Benteke and Lukaku are proof of that He was one of the most prominent strikers and scored 19 league goals, I'm surprised you don't know anything about him!   He's fast, strong and tall, extremely fit, a workhorse, great technique. Has always been all of those things but has over the past 3-4 seasons become a good finisher too. Put him as a striker in the Ange system and he will score goals! He will get in the box and be a focal point There's a good chance he'll be worth it. Expensive, for sure, but with the market for strikers as it is right now, a domestic home-grown player in his mid-20s and proven goalscoring ability in this league is going to command a premium wherever you look, and he looks like a very good fit for Postecoglu's system so they won't need a tactical rethink to accommodate him. Other teams have paid a lot more for a lot less, or at least for as-yet unproven potential. He also has a pretty clean injury record, with only a few weeks off here and there over the past 5 years.  He has good pace for a 6ft tall player, and he's probably best-suited running onto through balls and cut-backs, and attacking low crosses, which should be of real benefit to how Spurs use their wide men without much adjustment needed.   He also has a *really* good first touch, and if there's one major weakness Spurs had inside the box last season it's probably that ability for the centre forward to make his own space to shoot quickly after receiving the ball. Quite lot of his goals last season came from one or two smart touches to open the space before placing the finish into the corners, rather than opting for power or the first-time snap-shot finish. A good handful of his goals came from pressuring defenders and attacking the goal directly from forcing a mistake. He's got that composure in tight spaces that Spurs seemed to lack at times last season. > I understand our signings  I don't. Therefore can you explain them to me. Can you explain why we need 8th goalkeeper for example? Nobody understands what you‚Äôre doing Big shoes, big big shoes, big shoes, big shoes. ‚ÄúWe cannot replace him. We cannot.‚Äù Archer and Abraham have been floated around as ideas. I agree. He had the season of his life last year and his value may never be higher. Smaller clubs survive on selling at the right time and retooling. Good luck to all involved. I've rooted for Solanke because I saw how good he was at England youth level and just thought he needed the right environment to succeed. Bc 20% goes to Liverpool. I think Bournemouth are trying to get as much as possible from Spurs. And he fits into Angie gameplan perfectly. He is more worth 55-65m easily. Dont understand the hate he gets. Knows the league, is english, workrate is big and press well. Can play different roles when needed- back to goal target man or poacher. Strong to bully defenders, with very good off the ball movement. Still quite young to grow.  Why people bring down his only ""one"" good season? Nunez scored 26 in Primeira and 6 before that season. And he went for like 85mil.   Solanke is good buy and fits Angie team well. Dont need a flashy name or toy constantly. It needs to work with the team and I am glad they went for him not Toney.  It is evident that many who say bad about him not being worthy dont really seen him play. Well rounded striker, absolutely tireless (and intelligent) runner, and a top presser. We love him to death, was integral to everything we did. Confidence went up another level last season in terms of finishing. Started scoring a greater variety of goals (headers v Forest, outside the box v Man. Utd, unbelievable turn v Luton), but mostly from in the box where he‚Äôs become pretty clinical.   I know you said highlight reels can mislead, but if you want to see all 21 goals from last season:   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iMv5ibrQScM&pp=ygUNc29sYW5rZSBnb2Fscw%3D%3D Yeah, I think the press & energy at the top end from him is ALMOST as important (Not as important as goals). One of the reason we were so open at the back a lot of the time is a disjointed press. Watch how good liverpool pressed with klopp, theyd sometimes have like 8 players in 1/8th of the pitch pressing & win the ball back so much so high. Its crazy good.  Lots of people say how good spurs backline is but why so many goals conceded & why so open? I think this signing will help all the players behind him with their press & hopefully soon help bring that goals conceded number down. We will see Other side of the coin is that since he‚Äôs the main outlet for Bournemouth, defenders will give him less space and time than he‚Äôd likely get at spurs, with Son to his left. Why do you think he's a limited player? Seems pretty well-rounded whenever I've seen him 60 mil for a striker who put in 19 and was the 5th top scorer in the prem is a pretty standard fee these days, particularly and English player moving within the league. Fair point he‚Äôs only done it once, but you buy a player on a high, and you pay accordingly.   You can definitively argue that it‚Äôs not the most responsible use of the money, but calling the fee ‚Äúmental‚Äù seems out of touch with the current market. > He's actually older than you think (27 in a few weeks) as well, so it's not like there's going to that much room for development.  I think this could work in our favour in that we have a LOT of young guys coming up within the next few years. If he can offer us some stability up top for a couple years then honestly that would be perfect. ‚ÄúEverything goes through him‚Äù sounds fantastic to me, our forward link-up play last season was a travesty Yeah that's it I think, dude's had great season. By faaaar the best player of Bournemouth. And Bournemouth sounds like not much, but in terms of money, let's be honest. Being mid-table in Premier League is worth more than being any position in any other league lol. Bournemouth has a similar budget to Bayer Leverkusen, would people expect Leverkusen to just give their best player (if there was one) for peanuts?  The last season was really great by him. BUT being 26 and only now finally kicking it off at Premier League level is the underwhelming part. It's hard to be convinced he can be a world class player reliably now.  All I think about this whole situation is... I guess Tottenham was not able to sign a world class player. They know better than us who was willing to come, who was not. They have a shit ton of money saved. Their ratio of how much they make to how much they spend is tops of the world. I dunno. It's the Tottenham way. Some people need to be forcibly disconnected from FBREF for their own good 22ga at bournemouth is good He's doing that for Bournemouth though. He'll be surrounded by much better players at Spurs and have a lot more chances created. What the fuck are you banging on about man? Hardly new, it‚Äôs been a trendy buzzword going all the way back to Klopp‚Äôs Dortmund Our owner said we had 2-3 targets lined up if and when he left, so we will definitely be getting someone in So do we üòÇ Depends if the sell on was on the profit from the sale or just the overall figure. Profit is more common It's probably the only time Liverpool didn't totally rinse Bournemouth in a transfer deal tbf And I remember Bournemouth got dragged for the fee. But now they look damn smart for buying low and selling high. Fair play to them How much did you sell him for? Or if they don‚Äôt wanna pay it upfront they may offer higher with spread out payments Looks like we aren't paying the RC. Looks like around 55m + addons. There was that 57 rumor earlier. 57 + attainable add-ons that‚Äôll bring it to 62 or so feels right. Maybe on a free next season that changes but yeah the attitude does seem an issue Yeah saw that but based on how spurs run, I doubt they pay the clause. certain clubs means top6 pl teams or what lol Ez 12 million Damn u know what it's not that bad, ik u guys would get it down from the 65m clause. Nah I‚Äôm being serious lol. Yeah it's a mad price but that's just the reality of the PL. Bournemouth would have no reason to sell their top scorer if they weren't being paid handsomely for it. Imo he‚Äòs like a 40-45 player. But honestly, if it works out and he scores 15 goals again, nobody will bat an eye. Think he fits you guys well. When Smith-Rowe is ¬£30m (who hasn‚Äôt played in 2 seasons) than an in-form English striker with 19 premier league goals, yeah that‚Äôs the market 55 is still quite high for a 26 year old who‚Äôs just had his first good season in the PL. Previous best before that was 6.¬†  Lots of strikers have one really good season then fade back into their usual self. Not saying this will happen but it‚Äôs a bit of risk at such a high fee. idk any striker hitting 20 goals in the prem is outstanding, how often did Drogba manage that for example? The other way of looking at it is his next best output in a prem season is 6 Yes, stats don‚Äôt tell me anything other than he‚Äôs had a good season. I don‚Äôt watch Bournemouth so have no idea what sort of player he is. >has a *really* good first touch  I absolutely love the sound of this We don‚Äôt and they know it bro. They buy assets and only try to flip them for profit, not players. It‚Äôs fucking disgusting We don't have a good goalkeeper, it's either taking a gamble on Mamardashvili or Costa (who are both expensive and probably won't come) or buying a bunch of guys and hoping they'll work out.   You play this season letting Jorgensen and Sanchez compete, then swap them for Jorgensen and the new belgian tower guy once he comes back from loan. You may not like this plan, but it's a plan. GKs are risky so we can just buy and sell cheap high potential ones like Slonina and flip them for profit or marginal loss, hoping they'll explode.  Anselmino, Paez, Estevao and Omorodion all look like smart transfers, too. I am frustrated, what we need is a CB, and the board seems to be ignoring this and even trying to push Chalobah out. They're basically playing the stock market rather than building a football club. It's like your daft uncle throwing all his savings into random stocks and hoping one of them will make him rich. I wonder who'll fit into them? A small person maybe, an attack child. Maybe he's confident of hitting all bangers, all the time If I were a Bournemouth fan I'd be happy with Abraham honestly everyone wants cobham graduates, except us. Can I interest you in a Jhon Duran? Yeah his best tally before that was 6. Its a bit of risk. Lots of strikers have one really good season then go back to their usual level. Has he matured into a top level striker or was it just an outlier season. Season before last he was seen as striker who was good in Champ and couldnt make the steup to prem. Time will tell. 60m is alot of money if he doesn't perform, but if he bangs in 20 next year no1 will bat an eyelid. nunez is never an 85m player though, can't use one player who was overpriced to justify another.  solanke will do alright with them, nice lad, decent player, i think he keeps them at their level without really pushing on. toney on the other hand has something about him that i think spurs lack, a bit of bite and swagger. unrelenting belief. even if he doesn't fit the system in the same way.  i watched loads of bournemouth last season, one of my favourite teams to watch actually and i think iraola is a genius. more than anything i'm surprised they held onto him. Nunez is constantly used as an example worth nowhere near what was paid for him so that's not the best comparison I have a question, (trying to imagine how good of a fit he could be)  Does he drop deep to receive to feet more often or is he more focused on making runs in behind the defence? Can he pass well too? Thanks, very helpful. A large part of the latter is because our first team defenders were frequently missing. When all four of them played our defensive record wasn‚Äôt bad at all. It was pointed out in the most recent Athletic FC video too. Solanke‚Äôs pressing will help but I think a bigger difference will be made by our defenders hopefully being fit and playing the majority of the season Last season at WHL was the same - full pitch press, every player involved (admittedly slightly smaller pitch!). This is exactly what gets overlooked by our fanbase. The only way we become a great defensive team is through our press not necessarily our defensive shape. Last year We struggled against teams that played a 3atb and could switch the ball because our press wasn‚Äôt up to par. Liverpool were the best at this and they basically got a 2v1 against Emerson on the left every time and ran away with the game Spot on about our press being disorganized. So many time last season it was too easy for a team to play right through it. I would say he's not got brilliant link up play/passing. Which for the way Spurs play is a bit concerning. His finishing isn't amazing either. Before last season he'd scored 9 goals in 65 games for Bournemouth in the PL. Because people were watching him long time ago when he was very raw, and was quite limited. Nunez only did it once in Portugal league and went for 85m  Solanke fee is fine and it fits Angie system. People are moaning on pointless facts. Pretty surreal innit. Imagine hearing 19 league goals for Bournemouth isn‚Äôt impressive. His only good season in PL at 26 years old¬† Football doesn‚Äôt really work like that though. Just as some players excel when they move to a bigger club I‚Äôm sure everyone can think of many examples where the player fails to step up for whatever reason. And he won‚Äôt be the focal point of the attack like he was with Bournemouth It‚Äôs been a thing yeah, but feel like recently it‚Äôs overly used to justify a players ability. Thankfully I trust the board to get a decent replacement or two in and to shop further afield than we used to under Eddie. Would also like a new DM possibly with the money. Considering both their record departures were Chelsea academy products, both those options might just fit in It‚Äôs on the profit. Around ¬£8m then Still in awe of how they fleeced them for Jordon Ibe ¬£19m. I think the sell-on clause is based on profit so we'd get ¬£9.2m if he leaves for ¬£65m ¬£19m + add-ons Ornstein‚Äôs IG post mentions release clause of 65m. Yeah he‚Äôs more appealing on a free but the wages he would be demanding would be most likely quite high considering he can lever clubs against each other. Paying 65m upfront is a big ask for all prem teams right now It means that they were open to negotiating a different payment structure so they keep more money  If we pay 65m, Liverpool get 13m, Bournemouth 52m  If we pay 50m+15m bonuses, Liverpool get 10m and Bournemouth get 55m  You get the point 1. Not everything is about Liverpool   2. Your maths is well off. Yeah say what you will about Levy, he doesn't get rinsed. Even on the occasions he has, the transfers haven't been expensive enough to hurt us (if all addons are met this would be our most expensive signing. Did you pick the wrong flair? Lol There's also a sell-on clause that gives money to Liverpool which no doubt raises what we need to pay. i wish he was that, but no attacker with 20+G/a goes for that anymore. Smith Rowe went for 31m and he has barely played in 2 years. i know hes a bit younger, but 40m is never gonna get you one of the hottest 9s from the previous season in the prem unfortunately he was also good in 22-23 too but people only pay attention to g/a Drogba saved his power for elimination games lol He would have scored that twice every season if he played us every game. Like trying to stop a bull Don't the players need to play in order for their value to increase?  Are they all going out on loan like before? We could do worse. He'd be a big risk though right? Just with the injury last year and only playing a few matches, it's pretty difficult to tell how it'll have effected him Sounds like Roma would also be happy to get rid of him from what I've seen. Would be a positive deal for both teams I have heard that one too. Yeah but Toney was never going to get signed because he has too many off-field issues (namely betting against his own team). Would be your best ever player too Nunez with a slight increase in his finishing is easily a 85m player. He can drop deep and link (often had to under O‚ÄôNeil because we were so passive, he got more assists than goals in 22/23). Has played as a 9/10 hybrid on occasions for us.   But part of the reason he‚Äôs had more success under Iraola is that he‚Äôs been able to spend more time higher up the pitch, in and around the box, and less time running back to find the ball. According to FBRef, he doesn't get on the ball much and isn't great on it. So he's more of a poacher. I'll have to watch it Bissouma was pretty key to that too. He was suspended or away at afcon and then massively out of form for most of the second half of the season, and that lack of defensive cover really hurt us. Our XI last season after the first 10 games was basically spin a wheel with the amount of injuries, international absences and awful runs of form  There was absolutely no cohesion for a while That's gonna happen a lot though, isn't it. Last season was something different, but you expect to have to use your squad through a season.  After the 1st team you've got Dragusin at a similar level, then:  - Davies who's never quite been at that level or a great fit for the football we're playing, and is probably slowing down around his age - Spence, maybe? No idea if he's good enough, or going to fight his way to be the back up this season.  - Gray, who tbh doesn't look built to play RWB at Prem level.   Our depth at the back is pretty weak, needing an upgrade at RWB, LWB, LCB to have a squad that's really strong enough to compete on an fronts (without a lot of luck). Iriola has changed our system though. I would not judge him under Parker and O'Neill. Seen this said a bit, but the striker in Anges system doesn‚Äôt get that involved in link up play.  They‚Äôre required to press a lot and put away chances in the box mainly. I'm not sure you know what's asked of the striker at Spurs.  Don't need a fancy flick 5-10 goals Firmino. Just need a 20 goals scored by finishing chances poacher type. I thought his linkup was pretty good? He had 9 assists in 22/23 We don't really need brilliant link up play or passing from the striker. Richarlison's allround play last season whenever he played was limited, but was scoring often (when not injured). Son is way better at that stuff, but I'd say that we're better when Richy was the striker vs Son. Honestly have you ever watched him? His link up play is one of his best traits. Stupid argument is this 9 goals before last season. Season before he had very bad coach who long balled and just wanted to surveve. Solanke played lot as target man and got 10a + 6g. Next season with Iraola he finally could play in attacking team and banged 19g.   And before these two season he last played in PL 19/20 season where he was so much younger and playing for devastating relegated side.   People glance only quick stats and make their argument, not looking at big picture. TBH last season spurs didn't involve their striker in the build up that often - they played the ball across the box from the wings like a billion times but it almost always went over the bar or directly at the keeper lol Oh and people find the Nunez deal ridiculous too if you  somehow missed that Watkins and Toney only had one good season at 24-25 till they had multiple. Strikers mature late. It takes a mountain of experience or ungodly physical gifts to excel at it.  This is obviously a more sensible signing than Jackson or Omorodion. Nobody is saying that there is zero risk involved though. His profile fits Spurs and he has good numbers at Bournemouth, so Spurs obviously feel it's a risk worth taking. Well he'll be the starting striker, so it's not like players won't be looking for him. Even if he's not the focal point, Spurs will be hoping that the fact that they have more creative players around him will make up for it. Pays for a nice little takeaway this evening 9.2m I think if it‚Äôs the 65m release clause It's funny at the time there was a narrative among some people that he had some huge unrealised potential. Clearly wasn't a top player. Yeah, that‚Äôs why I asked. Still a nice sum May I ask where you are getting the 65m¬£ from? Robbie Keane 2009 rebate:  ""We'll buy him back from you, for half price.... and we promise to pay you back in 15 years time"" Yeah but if Bournemouth are agreeing to sell it implies it‚Äôs below the release clause. is it that hard, just sell an academy graduate, or 5 Yeah but that's the point of the release clause. Like we don't actually want to sell him so hopefully you lot have paid up the release clause near enough in full otherwise I'll be a bit disappointed tbh Bonuses aren‚Äôt excluded from the sell on clause. Would be incredibly illogical and an easy way to bypass inconvenient clauses. Isn't his sell on fee around 20%? Pretty sure that would make their maths correct. Seeing that the deal pertains to Liverpool, I didn't have to make it out about Liverpool.  Oh atleast you scored a point in correcting me that it was the profit sellon and not a revenue sell on. Congratulations Nope. I really enjoy his football ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I didn't say it's a good strategy. At best they'll probably just break even given how much they've wasted on average players with potential. The number of players you can have loaned out is restricted too as far as I know. And Antony with an increase in his dribbling is easily an 85m player as well what's your point, Sherlock? So he can do both but has looked better playing more of a poachers role.   Interesting profile. Oh, that's interesting.   Maybe your future is probably more playmaking type wingers than inside fowards like Son. Doesn‚Äôt sound like Solanke to me I mean, I think he has good link-up play too, but good link-up play ‚â† assists. And Jamie Vardy too. Well they‚Äôre at least acting like the risk is worth the reward. And I just happen to disagree with that.  I said the same regarding Richarlison and Brennan Johnson, and am saying the same thing here. I think spurs are really overpaying for a lot of these talent coming from the smaller pl clubs. Have yet to be proven wrong. Pay for some mountains to go on Albert docks I was one of the people who thought he would replace Sterling for us. Then again, I also thought Sterling would become our new John Barnes. Hell, I even thought Moreno and Markovic would be amazing players.   My only redeeming factor is I realised Balotelli would be utter useless before he even set foot on the pitch for us. He did have huge unrealised potential but he suffered with his [mental health](https://www.givemesport.com/what-happened-to-jordon-ibe-the-ex-liverpool-player) [It's his release clause](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11661/13193772/dominic-solanke-tottenham-in-advanced-talks-to-sign-bournemouth-striker) Not necessarily, it could mean an alternative structure for either the same or higher fee People close to spurs earlier this week were saying it was 55 with addons but the payments were front loaded so you‚Äôd see a good chunk this season Could do big loan fee with agreed option at the end.  That's what Spurs did with Lo Celso to reduce the sell on fee owed to PSG ‚ÄùTie shoe laces: 10m‚Äù They definitely are excluded in some contracts. I feel like I've seen these deals happen all the time   The downside for the selling club is that the bonuses come with some risk. While the release clause is more cash upfront 20% of the profit, which would be closer to ¬£9m It‚Äôs a 20% of profit made clause. Bournemouth signed him for 24million.  Let‚Äôs say Spurs sign him for 60million. That‚Äôs 36million profit for Bournemouth. 20% of that goes to Liverpool, which would be 7.2million.  If they pay 64million, Liverpool would get 8 million.  For Liverpool to receive 12million using that clause, Spurs would have to pay 84million. 20% of profits, so their math might be correct but their starting numbers aren't. Same here üòÖ Is mine more controversial? And his pressing, and his final ball, and his finishing, and his tactical knowledge, and his... I think you get the point If you compare Nunez with Anthony you have a serious problem. Nunez is great at everything except finishing. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs much more than a poacher (he‚Äôs genuinely well-rounded and agile) but the higher up the pitch you can get him, both in terms of pressing and goal-scoring opportunities, the better imo. yeah that's generally what Ange has gone with based on what I remember reading about how he performed with Kyogo at Celtic Iraola's system was purely about playing off high turnovers so he was never being asked to link play. That doesn't mean he can't do it. Not exactly but there's some correlation Brennan has been really promising though. I wouldn't be surprised if he breaks out this season with atleast 10G 10A. Bear in mind he had 15GA last season too, not even starting the full season. Richarlison had a good season just gone, at least up until he got a few injuries towards the end. Johnson is only young so presumably they see a lot of potential in him. I wouldn't be writing him off after his first season. Johnson with 10 assist and five goals? Yeah this is it, chap Haha the Sterling comparisons were ridiculous. I'll admit I was excited about Balotelli, I drank the Rodgers kool-aid and thought that he'd be able to mentor him.¬† Reportedly not the release clause but 57m We've bought below the release clause: [\[POK\] Tottenham have agreed to pay Bournemouth ¬£57m for Dominic Solanke with ¬£30m up-front. Some minor add-ons on top of that figure of approximately ¬£3m. Working to complete the deal for striker they who desperately wants to come #THFC : r/coys (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1enw2wv/pok_tottenham_have_agreed_to_pay_bournemouth_57m/) Why would the fee be higher than release clause? Our tier 1s are saying there's still a fair bit of working out to do on the final details so hoping we get upwards of 60mil with majority upfront. Either way I'm gutted and you're getting an absolute monster of a player! Depends, any competent lawyer would draft such a scenario into the contract but ultimately it‚Äôs on the clubs to watch out for such loopholes.   PSG appealed to CAS about this specific case but CAS just said ‚Äútoo bad, you wrote a shitty contract‚Äù. In most cases clubs are diligent enough to account for such a scenario. Makes sense.   I'd seen it reported as 20% of the sale rather than profit, I'm guessing the guy above had seen the same. his pressing/work rate is above average, best part of his game That's the case for many strikers. Jesus would be an 85m player if you improved his finishing. A lot of players would be. But their finishing isn't good, so they're not worth 85m or even close. Have to agree here. He is hugely underrated in is well-rounded play. He brings so much to Spurs. Pressing, movement, poacher, target man, back to goal, strong, height, passing. He might not be world beater in all those aspects, but he does them well and elevates others around.   Angie can use him in lot of different ways considering if they sit back or need to fight against low block. He has still lot to grow into and more than sure 20+ goal season in PL are coming. A good part of Anges system is high turnovers That doesn‚Äôt sound too far away from the way we play atm Johnson also had a solid season. His G/A numbers were perfectly fine for a winger. United paid 42m for Zirkzee who had a release clause of 40m. They did that so they were able to spread the payment over 3 years or something, rather than paying it all up front. Bournemouth can require the fee as per the clause up front, or spurs can try persuade them to take worse payment structure for more cash It's already been described below, but clubs don't necessarily have ¬£60 odd million of liquid assets to toss around in one payment, which has to be done if you trigger a release clause. Most clubs recognise this and will happily sell for a few million more but allow the club to pay in installments over the next few years. Not saying this necessarily is the issue, could be you negotiated the price down, but it does happen One of our tier ones has said they‚Äôve agreed 57m with 30m upfront Also depends on how the deal is structured. I know we did some weird with with previous deals like Lo Celso to stop PSG getting a decent sell on fee. Yeah his numbers looked alright for sure, but I did think he was a weak link in that Spurs side and the numbers masked that a little. Still, he's only young and has lots of potential. Yeah have just seen that. I would be very disappointed if that's true I think it's because, like so many players of his type, his finishing needs improving. His xG was around 10, compared to the 5 goals."

Good player. Bit expensive but that‚Äôs the market right now.  I expect he‚Äôll do well, annoyingly. Time to go and cry all weekend Spurs have all the pieces from a creative profile to feed him perfectly, assuming he continues to show he can score goals, get on the end of chances and make chances out of very little like he has been at Bournemouth, this is a very good buy.   Hope Lancashire gets minutes as well, Spurs young u21/pl2 team last season were electric and from my brother a spurs fan it seems like they‚Äôll be playing lots of youth players in the first team. Best of luck to him. Happy to see him thriving. Just don't score against us! He's a good player but ¬£65mil is a very big number for solanke. Lots of goals from headers coming because he is SoLanky Huge amount of money but I really think this‚Äôll work out well for Spurs. Good signing and fit imo.   Very good deal if its say, 50-55m up to 65 with add ons etc. If it's 65m release clause/lump sum, then think it's probably an overpay, but one that you don't care about if he fits and scores goals - kinda reminds me of us with White where he was probably an overpay at the time and yet still an amazing signing given what he's done etc I think it's a solid deal all round.  He's a proven scorer in the premier league and a good age.  I think he'll do well and good luck to him, really worked his ass off after a difficult season or two post Liverpool. Honestly, it‚Äôs not just about his current ability‚Äîit‚Äôs about how well he fits into the system. Ange knows what he‚Äôs doing. 65m seems a little steep for Solanke but that's what the market is. Should be a good signing since it'll allow Son to play in his natural position more. I‚Äôd always thought the maximum length of contract is 5 years [deleted] Not saying he is a bad player but he has only had 1 good season at 26, will be interesting to see if he can do it again. Feels like a lot, but ange wanted him and we desperately needed a striker of his profile.  Going into the season with some decent depth in the attacking third. dom and Richie up top. Son, kulu, Johnson, timo, and Moore on the wings. Nice that kulu and Johnson offer different profiles on the right, having son back on the left full time is huge, timo is an ok depth option behind him. Excited to see how Moore will do in the minutes he gets. I genuinely think it‚Äôs a good signing regardless of the price. We had so many great crosses last year with no one on the end of them‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll be on the end of them. Why have you not capitalised Ornstein? It looks wrong, violently evil in fact. If this subreddit was properly moderated it wouldn't be allowed to happen. People in the comments need to realise that something can be expensive but not overpriced I feel like it goes under the radar quite how much Spurs have spent since Ange came in. This deal takes them to around ¬£335m~ on transfer fees since last summer. Whats happening with Richarlison? Haven‚Äôt heard anything about him. How‚Äôs he going to fit in with Solanke? Just no longer first choose? Hell of a transfer imo. Premier League fee is just something else Cant believe hes only 26. Guy was competing for starting spots at Chels & Pool when he was like 18 How is he still 26????? English tax is so fucking crazy, 65m???? Can't believe he's just 26. I have been hearing his name for so long, since he was Chelsea's star academy striker. What a waste of money The solanke signing is just the epitome of how people can manipulate stats to show whatever they want. You've got one side of people saying he's only had one good season and therefore isn't proven. And then the other side showing how it's a season on season improvement who could get 15-20 goals Great move for Solanke 6 years at spurs, my word Slightly tangential question, but weren‚Äôt contracts supposed to be only 5 years long at max due to some new PL rule after Chelsea‚Äôs shenanigans? SELL-ON CLAUSE I don't get why these deals happen at such weird times. Don't these people work loosely 9-5 Monday to Friday?  Don't they spend evenings and weekends with their friends and family? Bournemouth to the championship confirmed. We got 9m from the sell on fee for Solanke. Now we shouldn't have a problem to trigger Zubimendi release clause. üëÄ Thanks for the 9 million lads I feel for striker 65 is the new 35 mil I also don‚Äôt think Spurs are anywhere close to being in FFP trouble, no point risking losing the player for 5-10M when the club is as rich as is. They won‚Äôt mind overpaying a little. They clearly don‚Äôt feel Richarlison is the guy and need someone to play with Son. Solanke‚Äôs goals record is very good but he is also a versatile forward with the ability to play wide and through the middle.   He is probably as close to Kane in goals plus style as you‚Äôll get for that budget. Always thought he was a meme player from his Liverpool days, but saw him a few times last season, particularly against United, he has improved immeasurably. We'll give you a free Reguilon, if you want. Lankshear needs a loan, he looked good in preseason but he's definitely the type that would benefit more from a season in the championship or league than one than being sat on the bench. I think the youth players that may be brought into the first team are Moore, Scarlett, Devine and maybe Donley too as he's looked very impressive playing the inverted left back role in preseason (is normally a number 10). Lankshear is solid but a big reason he was so great last season was because he has a man‚Äôs body playing against children. He‚Äôs looked solid at preseason but personally I think he‚Äôd be better going on loan in the championship to see if he‚Äôs really ready to make the jump Do think they miss a dribbly winger who can stretch teams. Johnson, Werner and Son are all runners/wide forwards more than carriers, and Kulusevski was fairly unproductive overall last year 26, English, decent enough to have put up 20 goals last season, and Bournemouth‚Äôs main man. Makes sense. 72 million is a big number for Hojlund  Big transfer fees are the going rate for 1st choice PL teams STs His quality is on par with Richarlison who was also worth around the 50-60M range. The big plus with Solanke is his availability and homegrown status This is the going rate for a pl striker, he's worth that based on the other striker signings in recent times. Ange wants a gunman as his number 9.  Someone who‚Äôs proven to bag goals in the prem is expensive.  Spurs also have a homegrown issue.  English tax   Bournemouth are not in a position where they have to sell.  Of all the options out there this is the safest bet. Also it‚Äôs not my money so I‚Äôd don‚Äôt care that much Seems like the going market for a striker who's scored 20 in a season. He's 26 too. Market is dry for ST's too. It's what he's worth to Bournemouth, scored 19 goals last season, he was integral to their attack, to how they press, and never missed a game. He was also on relatively low wages which makes a difference. He‚Äôs worth that to Bournemouth though.  Also speaking from experience if Ange has signed off on someone as a top target and a fit for his system I would put a lot of stock in that. I think he‚Äôll be fantastic for Spurs. Lots of talk about big numbers for someone who is arguably prem proven yet you‚Äôve got players from the academies being shuffled around the league for ¬£20m+ as a way to flaunt FFP regulations.  It‚Äôs not my money & he‚Äôs not a sexy name but he fills A LOT of criteria from an individual perspective also providing (if his form continues) consistency in an inconsistent front 3.  Has potential to be a great move & the fee will look better as the market continues to spiral into madness. It‚Äôs actually ¬£55m + ¬£10m.  Given the ‚ÄúEnglish tax‚Äù amount due to Liverpool (sell-on clause), timing during the window, Solanke‚Äôs prior year performance, and the fact that Bournemouth didn‚Äôt need to sell makes ¬£55m good value.  If he hits all the metrics required for the add-on of ¬£10m, no one would be complaining about the extra cost. Who do spurs get that is better for that money though realistically, bearing in mind that players like Oshimen are probably a no go due to their insane wage demands Reliable strikers are a pretty scarce commodity unfortunately.   Tottenham overpaid, but I think Solanke will improve them and even if he doesn't turn out overly prolific I think he contributes a lot regardless. Indeed, it's not that far off from what we got for Kane. Market is fucking ludicrous. It's gonna be so nice having at least 1 aerial threat in our front 3 Ben White is funny because I am completely unable to evaluate him as a player because of how completely ridiculous he is as a human being He‚Äôs scored 29 goals in 134 Premier League appearances and he‚Äôs a ‚Äòproven‚Äô goalscorer in it is he? People just say stuff without thinking about what it means on this sub eh? Max length for amortisation is 5 years, but contract can be longer Haven‚Äôt Chelsea been signing a bunch of 7 and 8 year contracts? Do you know if those prices were all including add ons? Just curious for comparison sake since everyone is doing it. Ali Gold (tier 1 for spurs) said it was ¬£55M based + add ons (i assume of up to ¬£10M) Where tf are you pulling those numbers from.   Hojlund - ¬£64m - rising to ¬£72m (sky sports)  Nunez - ¬£64m - rising to ¬£85m (bbc)  Isak - ¬£60m approx - sources inconsistent but 58-63  Gakpo - ¬£40m approx (bbc 35-44m)  Zirkzee - ¬£36.5m (bbc) 55M for Gakpo?   [It‚Äôs ¬£37M initial fee and ¬£7M fee in add ons.](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4041355/2022/12/28/liverpool-sign-cody-gakpo-transfer/) Those prices seem off and only isak of those have shown the form living up to their fee.  Price is high for a striker after one good top flight season. it still looks bad to me when your posting those numbers and players, apart from Hojlund He was very good in the championship tbf The player people keep saying is a better option, Gyokeres, is roughly the same age, has one god top flight season in Portugal, and would‚Äôve cost more. Ange has effectively overhauled the entire squad, we‚Äôve had 18 departures (with some huge wages off the books) and 16 arrivals since he‚Äôs come in  Only 12 players remain from the Conte era, which was just over 12 months ago Contracts can be any length, it's rhea amortization that's now capped after previous being tied to the contract mode often than not. Spurs keep giving out '6 year contracts' that are actually 5 years with an option to extend for another year When its within 20 days of deadline day 1 week til the start of the season the 9-5 probably goes out the window for a while. Yeah, no I really can't see that happening. Yep 2 Andy Carrolls is the new Andy Carroll grey historical sheet price direful insurance smell knee versed spotted   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Levy just hates spending. Spurs have capacity to spend above their already high revenues but Levy refuses. We have like 400M in cushion before we‚Äôd breach FFP Just because they can spend a lot within the rules doesn't mean there's a massive pile of money waiting to be used. It's mental that it's considered normal to think of top clubs as having infinite money these days, as if FFP is the only thing stopping spending. You also have to like, actually have the money. Nobody else wanted him so who would they lose him to? spurs aren't trying to sustain profits or mitigate damages due to ffp, they are doing it because there is no sugar daddy behind them to foot the bill... Reminder that people thought bournmouth got fleeced. now 4 years later theyre making a 40m profit on him. he wasn't terrible, you could tell he had a great shot on him but just couldn't fight his way into the starting quality at the time  and he did amazing for the national youth teams, but yeah he's definitely benefitted from regular playing time I never thought he was a meme. He was at Liverpool between age 19-21, during 2 season when Salah, Firmino and Mane were at their peak. Was always going to be hard to get regular game time at that age with those 3 in front of you. Sure, where do I sign? After his defending again dom when we beat you 3-2 I‚Äôd say now thanks From watching preseason I think Lankshear is a better fit at striker than Scarlett currently is. He‚Äôs more of a poacher type which works great in the current system Exactly, we had the same with Chido Obi-Martin I doubt he goes on loan since if the club wants him to be Club Home Grown he‚Äôd need to stay for the next two seasons. Mikey Moore may fit that profile depending how much time he sees. I think Kulusevski will ultimately be a CAM as opposed to a winger. And he did have 8g3a in the league last year. And 7.7 xAG. He was frustrating to watch at times but also suffered from our poor finishing. That's really the only season he's put up those numbers though, although as a Celtic fan I have faith in the  Spurs manager and my dog, Wee Ange, agrees. Also we get ¬£7m or so if I remember rightly which jumps the figure Yeah, if he matches last season, 65 is a good enough number.  The thing is can he continue to match last season. It's never easy to tell.  But in reality there are only 2 homegrown strikers that are possibly avaliable and seem that good. Dom and Toney. I assume Watkins isn't avaliable and DCL is broken.  So why not just risk it and try to get solanke. It's a good buy for a team that needs a striker. I bet you wouldn't be saying that if United splashed 70m quid on him. Would rather pay ¬£65m for a PL proven striker any day Both are overpays Who‚Äôs acting like that‚Äôs a fine amount though? [deleted] > Spurs also have a homegrown issue.  No we don't. We have a club trained issue if anything. Exactly. And considering liverpool have a sell on of 20% plus they bought him for 20 million, I feel the price is very fair. Kane went for relatively cheap because he was on the last year of his deal whereas Solanke still had three years left. When Kane had that long left on his contract, Levy was asking for ¬£160 million for him Richarlison is good aerially he's just a 7/10 every single week, which is probably exactly how your drunk friend would describe him when he tries to sell her tickets to a club in ibiza next summer Say stuff without thinking? Like when you just use appearance numbers, despite 63 of those coming from 2500 minutes, aka 27 full games when he was 21-22 and mostly appearing as a sub A large stretch of those 134 PL appearances were under managers who were utter shit like Scott Parker playing negative football, ofc he didn't score as much then. One season with Iraola playing actual football and he bangs in 19 goals. Context matters. proven in the sense that he has shown he can be very proficient in Iraola‚Äôs system, which is a very good indicator that he should fit our system very well and hit the ground running By summer 2014, Harry Kane had a career record across several divisions of 91 apps and 21 goals.   Solanke isn't Harry Kane, but it's an example that players don't just hit the ground running. Solanke is a late bloomer. The first three seasons he played in the PL he made 63 apps for 2500 mins. He got 4 goals, 3 assists and started just 24 times. Very average numbers, but really didn't start many games at all.  He's got 25 goals in the last 2 seasons and a further 10 assists for a bottom half team. They did, before the rules changed and mandated a maximum 5 year amortisation period. Except for Hojlund which is ¬£75m with addons the rest is all inclusive. [deleted] Isak had a very weak season for La Real before Newcastle bought him, if he scored 19 goals instead of 5 he'd cost much more. I understand why he‚Äôs spent that money but Spurs haven‚Äôt really been characterized as big spenders despite their outlay across three windows. Why though?  Like okay I can see the need to work longer hours but to sign a deal on a Friday night a whole week before the start of the season... Why not do it at 9am Saturday morning? We'll see So selling a striker who scored 19g last season isn't going to affect the team? It's because we're self sufficient, that's it. We can't spend more than our revenues allow, which is why we built the new stadium and doing all this extra stuff with NFL and concerts, any little bit of extra money is great for us.  Its why we didn't have the cash to really spend big over COVID, without stadium openings, our revenue became non-existent really.  Levy refuses to spend more (more than revenue) because he knows that if we have a bad year where our revenue drops significantly, we'll be in big trouble. Levy doesn't have any money to put into the team personally, his entire wealth is tied to Spurs value.  It's why we've been looking at outside investors to sell part of the club to, basically a sugar daddy willing to put in money. >Spurs have capacity to spend above their already high revenues but Levy refuses.  Yeah fuck them for not deliberately going into debt, what are they doing? This is a complete myth. Levy backed Conte with over 150m in signings. During the Poch era Levy backed him after the CL loss with Ndombele and Lo Celso (The players Poch pushed for)  And now he is fully backing Ange   We've spent a lot of money, just poorly It‚Äôs a contributor as to why we can spend so much now though We've spent big money for the last 5 years. It's been somewhere between 150-200 in all seasons apart from 2020.  We just don't go as mental like Chelsea or United do at times. Part of that is that we don't pay crazy wages either. And the other part is the absolute best players will usually have a better option than us,.so we never find ourselves in a position with the 70m+ players.  It's good for sustainability. Means that if we do continue to move forward we're going to be in a ridiculously healthy position. We can always sell Mikey Moore for 100m of pure profit‚Ñ¢ in one or two years. We should honestly just buy 5 goalkeepers because of that. Lose out to Bournemouth over the 5-10M Liverpool is getting 20% of the profit He didn‚Äôt play that game, he was on loan at Atletico Madrid lmao He is but I think Scarlett is good enough as 3rd/4th choice striker in the squad and long term the club benefits more from Lankshear going on loan and getting some regular experience than by keeping him on the bench in case both Solanke and Richarlison (and probably son and Deki) get injured and they need someone else to play up top. What‚Äôs he like, as a player? I know we signed him and I don‚Äôt watch arsenal youth teams so I‚Äôm interested to know how he plays He‚Äôs completely fine for that. Domestic loans don‚Äôt count against your time at the parent club for hg status. Very very very few 16/17 year olds are able to have a meaningful impact on a champions league contender‚Äôs season. Maybe next year or later down the line sure. Honestly think Kulu is gonna be the Swiss Army knife for CF, CAM, and RW this year. He looked great at the end of last season and in preseason playing as a CF, which was surprising. He can hold up the ball really well and has an eye for goal. If he has 2 seasons with 20 goals then his price will be ¬£90mil. Jumps the figure for how much Bournemouth want, not how good he is or how much Tottenham should be comfortable paying Yeah Watkins has 4 years on his 120k pw deal and is 29 soon so it's probably not cost effective for any other club to buy him when we'd ask for ¬£90m or something daft Is one good season in the Premier League enough to be considered PL proven given his previous seasons / age? Hojlund scored 9 for Atalanta at the age of 19 playing and wasn't even a regular starter for them ,Thats the same number of top flight goals Solanke had till the age of 25,Calling Solanke a ""proven"" PL striker is like calling Teemu Pukki a proven PL striker,Funny thing is Pukki actually scored more in one top flight season than Solanke had managed till the start of last season ‚ÄúPL Proven‚Äù is such a lazy cliche, it‚Äôs something a pundit would say. There‚Äôs plenty of ‚Äúunproven‚Äù players who join clubs and hit the ground running, as much as there are established PL players who don‚Äôt do well.  There‚Äôs a reason Spurs bought him and I doubt ‚ÄúPL proven‚Äù came up in their scouting report. Striker market is expensive these days as it is, but I do think it‚Äôs fair to say it‚Äôs a lot for a decent striker who appears to have hit his ceiling, but there might be more to his underlying stats that means Spurs see reason to invest in him. > Would rather pay ¬£65m for a PL proven striker any day  Can I tempt you with Danny Ings? >scored more goals in one PL season than anything Solanke had done till last season  That's a funny perspective.  You can literally present things any way you want to. For example Solanke scored as many goals last season as Hojlund did in his last two seasons combined.  Also Solanke once scored more league goals in a season than Hojlund has career league goals altogether.  And just to finish it off, potential isn't some set thing, some players never develop past their level when they are 21. Hojlund might forever be a 10 goal a season striker you don't really know. Should be. He's a pigeon. True but he's always injured He has made over 130 appearances and has yet to score 30 goals. Substitutes are actually allowed to score goals too, just because his minutes were limited doesn‚Äôt mean not scoring is good, he obviously didn‚Äôt play much for a reason. That just makes it look worse for him One season of scoring over 10 goals in the Premier League does not make you a ‚Äòproven‚Äô goalscorer. By that logic Marlon Harewood was ‚Äòproven‚Äô in the Premier League. If he does it in his first season for Spurs *then* he‚Äôll be proven. Just because you‚Äôve signed him doesn‚Äôt mean you have to pretend he has a great goalscoring record mate. Yes, but also still only one season Quit making excuses for him [deleted] They still are signing them onto long contracts. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you get those numbers?‚Äù  /shares approximately the same numbers give or take Think he was injured though and la real had a poor season because he was good the season before he got sold. Ever since the new stadium revenue came in we have been spending fairly regularly, about ¬£150m a season (not net spend) I imagine a big part of this kind of deal is timing. Maybe you want to let things settle, or not let things settle, or catch particular players in a negotiation at particular times.  There is also the factor of wanting to get the player in as quickly as possible, get a medical done, have him training with the squad, meeting the manager and the staff etc as soon as possible. Of course it will, but they've got a very good manager and plenty of good players in the team already, and they're going to have quite a bit of money to spend because of the sale. Nothing is guaranteed obviously but I really doubt they'll be one of the worst three teams in the league this season. I mean... really the way it should be. What is Tottenham opinion on Levy? When I think of him I actually think that he is Perez-ish for Tottenham level, making the club a permanent PL top club, building new stadium (during Covid!),... and still always being made fun of especially when it is about transfer and cup achievements All of this is correct except the 3rd paragraph. Levy is an employee and only a minority shareholder. Joe Lewis / ENIC are the owners and could put lots more money in. He did inject ¬£100m last year. Another key point is that, of the big 6 teams, we are in the best position FFP wise. Who said anything about debt? I'd argue that over the last three or four windows we've actually spent really well. Last summer was one of the best transfer windows we've ever had - van de Ven, Vicario, Madison and Johnson all very good signings who came straight into the first team We also had a window where we spent nothing. But you could spend so much more Ya 400M is a bit tight. Need to get it closer to 500M Oh I thought he was the guy who tapped it in behind to dom for his goal lol right, I was convinced he‚Äôd gone to Bayern, I forgot.  I‚Äôve only seen some clips but he‚Äôs an absolute unit. I think from the age of 16 he was already banging in 4 and even once 7 goals a game with the U18s. He‚Äôs good at exposing the backline and timing runs perfectly, very physical as well, and good low corner finishes.  My fear with these kind of players is that they‚Äôll heavily rely on being bigger than the other kids, and we don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll develop enough yet technically to break through to elite senior levels. Very promising though. Lamine yamal has a poster of Mikey Moore¬† Moore will probably get cup minutes and the odd league run out. The kid's very, very special. He's look extremely comfortable in pre-season and hasn't looked out of place, but it's an entirely different dynamic. When there is a chance to slag off United it is, otherwise no. If there is a chance to get Isak for 65mil, will your club buy him? If yes then you have the answer to your question You're being harsh, in Pukki's best ever prem season he scored 11 goals, Solanke just scored 19. That's more than the ""one season wonder"" strikers like Demba Ba (16 goals), Michu (18)   I wouldn't say he's PL Proven, just below that, but I don't think there's a striker that's as good as Solanke that can be bought for this fee by a non CL club [deleted] If he had done this for two seasons he‚Äôd be worth 100 million pounds. English strikers are expensive. Those numbers are all well and good, but we're in 2024 and Solanke has just scored 19 goals with only Watkins and Haaland scored more non-pen goals.  Hojlund is entirely potential right now. There is absolutely no guarantee he'll have a 20 goal PL season, but he's young.   The Teemu Pukki dig doesn't make any sense when you're defending Hojlund who was also outscored by Pukki in their respective debut seasons. And Pukki played for a team that got relegated. We can all cherry pick. His 9 goals came against Monza in 19th. Spezia Calcio in 17th. Bologna in 12th. Salernitana in 15th. Lazio in 6th. Lecce in 13th. Empoli in 14th. Verona in 18th and Monza in 11th.  The entire time he was playing for a club that comfortably sat between 4th and 6th.   I'd also argue that someone who started 20 of the 32 games he played is a regular starter.   > Thats the same number of top flight goals Solanke had till the age of 25  That's just wrong. 7 goals in the Eredivisie. 9 goals in the Premier League. Both are top flights.  Hojlund had the benefit of playing for Atalanta who were a top 6 team. Solanke has played for teams fighting relegation battles and promotion battles. Big big difference in quality of players on those teams. Talk about cherry picking. At 25 he had just played 2 seasons in the championship and scored 44 goals. Obviously clubs do more than just pull up a player's Wikipedia page at look at goals scored when thinking about signings, but it's also definitely the case that a PL club (or indeed any club from any top league) will value success, regardless of the metric, more highly if it's come in the league the singing club play in. I'm honestly confused why so many in here are saying it's a lot, like you said the striker market is expensive but it's worse than people think imo, I don't think anyone in here can name a striker as good as Solanke that'll go to a non CL club for less than this fee. Even if they had CL they wouldn't find anyone imo [deleted] Hahahahaha this clown criticises people for just saying shit right after just saying some shit but not actually looking at stats. Fucking reddit. There's a reason everyone uses p90 statistics for anything that matters. ...how? I mean describing 19 goals in the premier league as over 10 feels a little unfair. He seems to be on an upward trajectory and is joining a better side in Tottenham.    I think there's reason for Tottenham fans to be optimistic and Bournemouth can feel happy at that Transfer fee. Everyone, THIS guy makes rules of football, bow down to him now or else!!!!!! whats the problem with an excuse if its valid? If you're asking me that question, I think you've completely missed my point. Congratulations. For young players on low wage packets (that they‚Äôre buying, in essence, as investments) that also makes sense despite not being able to amortise the cost over the full term of the contract. The one that looks off is Zirkzee, and even then, you *have to* consider the huge agent fee they paid to get him. ‚Ç¨15m or sth like that, in the end that adds up to how much he cost United no matter who got it on the other end. This is why i find it funny that Spurs is the club that gets shat on the most out of the big 6 on this sub for a community that hates what the game is becoming and how clubs break the rules   If anything they're the ones people should like the most or hate the least because they're the most sustainable big 6 club and generally run their club more ethically than some of the oil and gas clubs do or the Glazers with Man Utd   The other 5 are the issue, and yes including Arsenal as well especially after Wenger left the club and they've been splashing the cash left right centre Clubs with more plastic fans get to spend more money who continue to be more successful and in turn get more plastic fans. That‚Äôs literally the only growth left in football and locks out 99% of all clubs from competing. There's no unifying opinion, and our fanbase is just as fairweather in regards to him as they are towards the players. During the Mourinho and Conte years the Levy out crowd was gaining significant steam and there were even a few demonstrations. But one year later and you hear barely a peep from them. Objectively it's hard to shit on him, we're essentially the only sustainably run top 6/8/10 club in the Prem. Glory will come. Levy owns 36% of ENIC now. So whilst yes, he isn't the outright owner, he is still a substantial part of the club and it's ownership.  Joe Lewis also doesn't own anything to do with Spurs, he dropped his position in ENIC to his daughter about 3 years ago. (Though people think it was 6 months ago due to poor journalism around his corruption case)  So yeah, Levy owns 36% of ENIC who owns 89% of Spurs, whilst Viviana owns the remaining 65% of ENIC.  Also, the ¬£150M wasn't really an injection in those terms that most injections are.  ENIC leveraged more share options. ¬£150M worth to be precise. Their ownership went from 86.5% to 89%. So they essentially paid the club for shares. All sustainability rules are about debt. It‚Äôs the maximum ‚Äúallowable‚Äù loss. If you are pushing the edge of the rules by definition you are going into debt. Some clubs just have owners with infinite money who will allow this Sounds great I wouldn‚Äôt buy Isak on the basis of him being PL proven and more so how good he is in general.   I just don‚Äôt see Solanke as a safer choice to do well as opposed to buying a striker from outside the Premier League that also puts up good numbers. Idk. I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure that F√ºllkrug, Dovbyk and Guirassy are worse than Solanke and they‚Äôre closer to costing as much as him combined It would be a fair point if Spurs signed him a year ago. Because they aren‚Äôt signing Solanke for ¬£65m before last season when his best season was 6 goals, they are signing him now when his best season is 19 > Hojlund had the benefit of playing for Atalanta who were a top 6 team. Solanke has played for teams fighting relegation battles and promotion battles. Big big difference in quality of players on those teams.  There is a reason for the gulf in quality between the sides both played for ,Hojlund was being linked with top sides like PSG and United while Solanke was playing in relegation battles,PSG literally made a ‚Ç¨50 million opening bid for Hojlund while perennially trophyless Spurs is the best Solanke can manage,Its actually disgraceful people are comparing top tier talent to someone like Solanke   https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4862234/2023/09/23/how-manchester-united-signed-rasmus-hojlund-ten-hags-video-calls-agents-scrap-and-turning-down-psg/ Solanke played for a very good Liverpool team and didn't make much of an impact so I don't know if that point really holds.   But this whole comparison is pretty pointless at the end of the day. Definitely agree it factors in, I personally just hate the term ‚ÄúPL proven‚Äù, or brings ‚ÄúChampions League Experience‚Äù etc. funnily enough people don‚Äôt say the latter about players coming from Malmo. Pavlidis? I reckon he'd choose Spurs over Benfica. Dallinga is also better and younger and went for ‚Ç¨15m. Also I reckon ¬£65m is enough for Openda Solanke has played 4 Champions League games in his career.. >Fake stats lol  Hojlund career league goals: 28  Solanke league goals in 21/22: 29  Like I said it all about how you present the facts I guess. Hojlund is not going to add a lot of CL goals to that total is he now?  >Hojlund's numbers on the other show a clear trend of progression  Man went from 9 goals for Atalanta to 10 goals for Man Utd. In 10 years time he might be a 20 goal a season striker, amazing progress. Hojlund might be the next talent wasted at Man Utd, wouldn't be the first one. Martial scored more in his first season and he fell off hard... It's almost like it's pointless predicting 'potential' like it's Fifa career mode.  Maybe you missed the progress Solanke made going from 3 to 6 to 19 PL goals with some great seasons in the Championship in between.  Guess bro missed the mark so hard he dipped... If you say so. There are no statistics that make Solanke a ‚Äòproven‚Äô Premier League goalscorer. Cuz it only goes to show how mediocre he was that he couldn't get a string of games If he gets 15+ for Spurs this season then he can reasonably be described as proven. There are plenty of strikers who had one double figures scoring season in the Premier League and then never repeated it, you can only be proven with consistency. [deleted] Solanke was mediocre, not the fault of the coach Before the internet this is literally how things were. You used to be able to go anywhere in the country and have decent chats with people but now it's just the same tired memes you see on social media.  I've literally been told I support a banter club by a Reading fan. It's hilarious but also depressing how quickly the internet has warped peoples minds You have to factor in that a large portion of this sub don't know much about modern football history. People don't realise that Spurs are a big club with a rich history. We've only been overtaken in trophy count by City and Chelsea in the last decade and we all know how that came about, not to mention those are the best eras in those clubs' entire history as well.  For all the complaints about clubs not being allowed to spend beyond their means due to PSR and therefore not being able to grow, it's absolute bollocks.   It was in 2004 that Spurs first started putting down foundations to improve. We had Keane, Defoe, King at the club. We brought in Carrick, Robinson and Dawson and Jol became manager. From there we challenged for the top 4 the next season but got lasagna'd. We qualified for the UEFA Cup three years running and won a trophy (wtf) and eventually ended up in the Champions League and this is in the midst of Chelsea and City super-juicing and the establishment top 4. It was Spurs that first broke through that top 4 moniker that was coined in the late 2000s.   The next decade was incredible growth.Terrific transfer business, a generational academy graduate but we'd already commited to the new stadium and couldn't attack the market as much as we should have capitalize on that peak. That stadium cost us back then, but as we approach ever closer to a decade since it began, it's already helping is now. We've proven you can sustainably build and compete. It doesn't actually take 20 years, we got to the champions league in 6 years and then managed to become a regular in about a decade. Others clubs are trying to take shortcuts which don't exist without issue.  Spurs shouldn't be hated at all. We're the only club.who's managed to put ourselves firmly in amongst the big boys for season after season without juicing. But maybe that's the reason we're disliked.   It's good to be a spurs fan. The club is healthy, we have a good chance of champions league qualification every season and outside of the rest of the top 6 we've always got a chance to go deep in the cups (not that we actually take it). It‚Äôs very simple why we‚Äôre such a target  The established elite ‚Äúbig 6‚Äù don‚Äôt like us because we dragged ourselves forward to compete with them and they don‚Äôt think we deserve to be with the ‚Äúbig clubs‚Äù  The other 14 don‚Äôt like us because we are part of the ‚Äúbig 6‚Äù that they despise  Rest of Europe aren‚Äôt fond of us by association because we are part of the rich ‚ÄúPremier League‚Äù that is corrupting football  So basically we don‚Äôt fit with anyone, and kinda just fend for ourselves on here  Chelsea and Arsenal are two HUGE fanbases as well, have fun going against them on any platform Liverpool are run exactly how the other person described Spurs are run. There is no outside investment from the owners >yes including Arsenal as well especially after Wenger left the club and they've been splashing the cash left right centre  ...but Arsenal are primarily in that position because we did exactly what you're praising Spurs for haha. We had a decade where our net spend was 0, we had to sell our best players and it was all done in service of the future.  This is the future. This is why Wenger insisted on us building the Emirates. This is why we signed long commercial deals that saw us lose out on rising revenue. I agree with you, but I think arsenal haven't had that much personal investment by kroenke, given the time frame they've been around and the debts they've put the club through.  But you're right in that the quantum of backing isn't really the issue Damn 101% ownership of Enic. No it isn‚Äôt. The losses can be covered by share holders putting money in but only to a certain amount. [watch this video about why solanki to spurs makes sense ](https://youtu.be/3l0IewKlLCw) Not home grown Fullkrug is 33 next year. Guirassy is a huge gamble as he a world class season after previous bests of 10 and 11. Not to mention Bundesliga striking targets and their recent history.  Dovbyk is very handy, but he too has only had one good season in a top league. [deleted] Does one 19 goal season at 26 make you a ""PL proven striker"" when your track record before that is 3 and 6 goals ?A lot of times some attacker from a bottom half team will have magical numbers in a season before regressing to the mean,Paying 65 m for that is just absurd ,Look at Richarlison he had more consistent numbers but still couldn't cut it at Spurs and you could actually describe him as a PL proven striker Oh please dude.  PSG gets linked to every single player in the world. > Solanke played for a very good Liverpool team and didn't make much of an impact so I don't know if that point really holds.  He didn't play even close to the amount of games or minutes for Liverpool that Hojlund played for Atalanta.. I know you're only using it as an extreme example, but Malm√∂ haven't had any high profile departures and aren't CL regulars. It's definitely something that gets mentioned for high profile signings who have done well in the CL, regardless of where they've come from. How is Dallinga better? Openda has good scoring record but he does not fit profile Angie wants and he is on the smaller size.   People often bring out strikers who score decent or more in other leagues, but they are not bought for reasons the scouting does not deem deserved. Often those who come never really manage to produce those numbers. Respectfully, I'm not even looking at Pavlidis after Janssen. That shit scars you.  Dallinga better than Solanke is some shout and I've got no idea what it's even based off. Solanke has never hit 29 goals in a league season Yes because ""proven"" is a completely subjective metric. If you look at him as a striker for a CL chasing team and look at his past two seasons then I doubt anyone wouldn't judge him a good option You! Oh wise masterful one! I love the term juicing here, so fitting. Spurs being like a natty coming into a bodybuilding competition crowded with juiced folks. Yeah and the reason Liverpool, Man Utd and Arsenal are in this position and have never had to resort to oil/state backed owners like City, Chelsea and Newcastle is because those three clubs outspent everyone in the league 70-80 years ago  They were basically the City and Chelsea of that era and they've built their history that way to the point that people see them as ""purer clubs"" now because they've whitewashed their history now that everyone from that era who remembers what they did is dead refer to my other comment further down in the chain below where i said Arsenal's present success is built off the back of the corruption and bribing scandals Arsenal was involved in, in the early 20th century  without that stuff, Arsenal would never be in the position its in now if they actually played by the rules Share holders pumping in money is still an operating loss lad husky crush hunt consider desert squeeze skirt zesty hungry childlike   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)* Wasn‚Äôt the point no? He said there‚Äôs no striker as good as him that‚Äôs cheaper which I disagree with. We all know how we arrived at that valuation with him being English and transferring between two PL sides And Solanke isn‚Äôt with his previous PL campaigns of 6, 3, 0 and 1 goals? The thing about Guirassy is that he does pass the eye test as well and doesn‚Äôt look like a fluke who stumbled into good positions often enough. 28 goals in 28 games isn‚Äôt possible just through luck imo. Also F√ºllkrug turns 33 in February 2026.  Bad scouting by PL teams also isn‚Äôt an argument for me. Be it Moyes expecting every striker to play like Antonio (ironically F√ºllkrug probably comes the closest to what he would have wanted) or Timo Werner working in exactly one system. Teams with good scouting somehow nail pretty much every Bundesliga transfer (Sane, G√ºndogan, Dzeko, de Bruyne, Gvardiol, Szoboszlai, Firmino, Konate, Akanji, Endo) Rashford isn't a one off year tbh. He had a horrible last season but his floor is significantly higher than the others you named here >Rashford  You can't be serious Solanke was known as a great talent at youth level (which is why Liverpool bought him), and he's had three good goalscoring seasons for Bournemouth, with one of them being last season. Yes, in exactly the same way as one season of scoring 9 goals for Atalanta makes you have ‚Äòpotential‚Äô.  We can only work on the figures in front of us for any player, Solanke is coming off the back of a great goal scoring year in the premier league, therefore he has proven that he is capable of scoring a high number of goals in the premier league.  It‚Äôs interesting you use the fact that Hojlund‚Äôs 9 goals came for Atalanta but you‚Äôre ignoring the fact that Solanke has done this for Bournemouth. Atalanta, a regular top half club with a few top 4/5 finishes recently vs Bournemouth who finished 12th last year. Please look a bit bigger picture. Those 3 goals came season he played 19/20 season 1600minutes that was relegated, he was nowhere near main guy.After that he scored 15 and 29 goals.   Back in PL he yes scored 6 goals but 10a with coach who played very anti football. With his first full season under belt with good manager he scored 19.   Going only stat based is wrong and does not paint the  full picture. I don‚Äôt disagree with what you‚Äôre saying here, just in the previous post when you said Pukki has scored more in one season than Solanke before last year Richarlison scored 11 goals last season despite being injured for large parts of it. Richarlison is absolutely fine at Spurs. He had a horrendous first season and we all know the reasons for that now. And last season once he had the surgery he needed he was shit hot and ended up with 15 G/A despite only playing 1500 mins due to further injury setbacks (as a result of coming back too quickly after that surgery).   Solanke isn't being brought in because Richarlison is bad, he's being bought in because we have European football again and we have to be privy just in case Richarlison never manages to find true fitness again. But if he doesn't, that's less of an issue now. Look at Luca Toni's career players only need one season to turn a corner Read the article ,They didn't just get linked the made a ‚Ç¨50 million opening bid Probably because he made little impact though.   I'm just pointing out that the point you're making for Hoijlund you can flip the coin and make for Solanke. He made 27 appearances - mainly off the bench but enough times to at least make more of an impact and only scored one goal. You're dismissing Hoijlund doing well for a good team but then you can say Solanke didn't do as well in the same environment.  But again this whole comparison is pointless. Different players develop differently. You‚Äôre right there‚Äôs better examples out there 21/22 season, don't blame you for blocking it out of your memory considering how it ended for you lot.  I replied to the man saying you can present stats and whatnot however you want to, which is why I presented Championship league goals the way I did as factually 'League goals'. Two seasons? He scored 6 goals in 32 starts in the 22/23 season. Pretty sure a CL chasing team would only ever be chasing if that was the best they were getting from their main striker. [deleted] That is simply not true for Liverpool. Liverpool spent big on a couple of players during their dominant 25 year stretch, but no more than midtable teams and were mainly developing young players. Look at the majority of their greats:  Clemence from Scunthorpe. Keegan from Scunthorpe. Rush from Chester. Neal from Northampton. Hansen from Partick Thistle. Toshack from Cardiff. Hughes from Blackpool. Whelan from Home Farm. Nicol from Ayr. Grobelaar from Crewe. All of those are either lower league or smaller Scottish & Irish teams, found through excellent scouting and generally bought for little, put in the reserves for 2 years and developed slowly into the First Team.   Then they coupled that transfer system by developing their own players; Smith, Case, Callaghan, Thompson, Heighway, Fairclough, Lee all came from the academy or bought as teenagers for pennies from non league clubs.   Liverpool didn't start spending any kind of big money regularly until Dalglish took over and they were banned from Europe, by which time they'd already won 10 league titles, 2 FA Cups, 4 League Cups, 4 European Cups and 2 UEFA Cups over a 20 year period of unprecedented dominance.   The only expensive signings they really made were Kennedy, Souness, Lawrenson and Dalglish, and Kenny was bought with the money they got for Keegan. They were never outspending the other teams to be successful, and probably had a pretty average midtable net spend for that whole 2 decades.  And without going into loads of detail for United, 70-80 years ago they were and still are famous for the Busby Babes Team, where they brought basically a full team through the academy and were dominating English football with those players until the disaster, how is that outspending everyone? Even the second Busby Team that won England's first European Cup in 68, the most famous players were Charlton (academy), Best (academy), Law (big signing, but was injured that season), Stiles (academy), Crerand (bought for cheap from Celtic) and Foulkes (academy). That's 1 expensive signing, not outspending everyone on the way to 2 leagues, an FA Cup and a European Cup. Just read your comment, which is a bit vague on the details of the alleged bribing and corruption scandals, but I'm gonna assume this is referencing to the club going up to the First Division.  No one can definitely claim Arsenal did anything close to bribery to get that spot. It was a vote, Norris rallied and got the most votes. Should have the expansion slot been down to merit? Sure, but it was a vote, and we won.  Even then, to pin our financial capability in *2024* to what happened in *1919* is a bit rich considering the powerhouses back then where Blackburn, Huddersfield Town and Liverpool lol. This completely ignores the work put in by people like Norris himself (moving the club, which increased the club's revenue to record levels), Chapman (great manager who won shit and did things like getting the station named after the club plus making the kit more visible, plus pushing for floodlights and fancier stands) and Wenger (great manager, pushing for the club to be self-sustaining, pushing for the new stadium and  almost single handedly keeping the club afloat through the transition before massive TV money was here.)  Kinda feels like you just wanna hate lol. There are rules in PSR/FFP that state that creating new shares and selling them etc is allowed to cover losses.  Only a fraction, but still within the laws, lad. It's not clickbaity, they are one of the best if not the best channel regarding football tactics Solanke is a gamble. But a 19 goal PL season is a calculated risk for a PL club.   Respectfully, Spurs already have a 28 goal season Bundesliga forward as our back up left winger.  Other 20 goals BuLi strikers in that time frame; Andre Silva, Weghorst, Schick, Modeste. Obviously I've left off Haaland, Kane and Lewa. And I haven't added Openda or Guirassy because that's ongoing. But it's not a largely healthy list. Those guys scored 20 goals and fell off a cliff.  Special mentions to Nkunku, who we haven't really got to see if he's the real deal yet in England and I've left off Kramaric simply because he is so consistent.  Thanks for clarifying Fullkrug's age, I'm sure a 32 year old striker come the mid-season is the medium to long term planning we're looking for. > Yes, in exactly the same way as one season of scoring 9 goals for Atalanta makes you have ‚Äòpotential‚Äô.  There is a difference between doing it at 19 and having the only season worth talking about in your career at 26,On top of that playing for a top club like Atalanta doesn't automatically improve your output because goals in well balanced attacking sides are shared and every attack doesn't go through one man ,Hojlund at 20 in his first season in England playing for a horrible United has scored 15 goals including CL..Sky is the limit for him on the other hand i wouldn't be shocked if Solanke regresses back to the mean in a side where he isn't the main man..Richarlison was a more proven striker in PL than Solanke and he barely got 10 for Spurs People keep looking at that 22/23 season as a negative, but a bottom striker racking up 15 G/A is always decent. Nevermind when you go even better the season after.  Racking up 35 G/A over 2 seasons is strong. United mouthpiece saying United beat out a richer club.  Yeah, sure they made a bid. Was that before or after they signed two other strikers for big money? Not really though. Atalanta had one other striker who missed a fair bit of the season due to injuries, which allowed Hojlund to get more game time.  Liverpool had 4 strikers, including Solanke. Two of them were fit and played majority of the season.  Hojlund got a lucky break, Solanke wasn't given that chance that Hojlund got. >Championship league goals  Lol And this season he scored 19. Jesus has 4 and 11. Isak had 10 last season. Nunez managed 11 and 9. Hojlund has 9 and 10. Jackson 14 and 12. He's not Haaland, and Watkins is a cut above, but otherwise he doesn't look bad.  You can caveat that with his greater appearances, but that's a point in his favour as well: several of the others are quite injury prone. Isak has 7 more goals but you can't trust him to be available regularly. You'd be correct. Which is why we bought him after he scored NINETEEN GOALS.   You can't even make a compelling counter argument without killing it yourself. Says the guy desperate to be the authority on who‚Äôs proven and who‚Äôs not üíÄ  THEY‚ÄôRE ONLY PROVEN WHEN I SAY SO!!!!! Lol okay chud. And which of these players went for anything close to the 75m‚Ç¨ that Solanke is going for? Teams obviously knew that it isn‚Äôt replicable which is why Weghorst went to a relegation candidate for 14m‚Ç¨ and Modeste was shipped off to China and then to Dortmund for 5m‚Ç¨ after his second 20 goal season. Idk what to tell you if you‚Äôre not able to judge players independently from each other Richarlison got 11 goals in 1500 mins. Of the players with that tally and above only Haaland, and somewhat bizarrely, Chris Wood, scored more non-pen goals per game than Richarlison.  You keep talking down in Richarlison without actually looking at his numbers properly. Hojlund is mediocre Ok, and putting your United bias aside, I‚Äôd respond to that by saying that I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Hojlund doesn‚Äôt live up to his potential and that Solanke goes on to have another high scoring season. Solanke played more minutes than Sturridge and Ings that season but didn't make an impact. Hoijlund played more but made a greater impact - it's really not that complex.   I just think you're moving goalposts here. Dismissing what Hoijlund did for a good team but then making excuses for Solanke not doing much for an even better team. Yes he might not have played as many minutes but he had ample opportunities to make a great impact than he did.   But again it's all really quite pointless. What? The Championship is a league. Just facts. >Isak had 10 last season.  Uhm what? Isak had 21 last season. Jesus was signed for much less and no-one thinks he‚Äôs good enough. Liverpool fans still have doubts about Nunez. Hojlund was obviously overpriced and is unproven. Jackson is younger and was much cheaper. [deleted] Have you not considered that none of them went for that much because of, well, what was proven immediately after? That they're not worth it? I'm not moving the goalposts. I'm stating exactly what happened and the circumstances.  Atalanta had two strikers. One who was injured a fair bit.  Liverpool had 5 strikers, considering I forgot Ings. Two of those strikers were playing regularly ahead of Solanke.   The team that has 2 strikers is going to use those 2 more often than the team that has 5 strikers is going to use them. Especially when two are well ahead of the rest.  He had the opportunity but he wasn't starting nearly enough to make the same impact Hojlund did.   It is pointless, because again, you aren't understanding the circumstances of Solanke at Liverpool vs Hojlund at his former club. Irrelevant considering you're comparing it to Hojlund . Skewed stats designed to spread misinformation He's probably referring to 22/23 as last season. Their referencing the 22/23 season as last season, not 23/24. Likely because the coming season hasn't started yet so 23/24 can still be considered this or this past season dependant on your interpretation. Hence why Spurs have paid this for Solanke. All these different strikers that haven't worked out. Someone who can hit 19 in a season is very valuable Classic Reddit chud: someone makes fun of them, so they have to make accusations of being ‚Äúupset‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ what on earth would I have to be upset at? I‚Äôm simply mocking you. That‚Äôs what I said though? They‚Äôre not as good. Which doesn‚Äôt mean every striker in the Bundesliga can‚Äôt cut it elsewhere and I‚Äôm of the opinion that you‚Äôre able to judge that before they move too. And as I said I believe that Guirassy is quality and in no way comparable to Weghorst, Modeste or Silva. Before Werner moved I and many other Bundesliga fans also said that they‚Äôd better brace themselves to see him miss a lot of chances No I get it but youre downplay Hoijlund impact at Atalanta yet you're making all sorts of excuses for Solanke not making an impact. If Hoijlund did fuck all them fine but he did alright for a young striker.  Solanke had ample opportunities to prove to Liverpool what he could offer and could only score on the last day of the season in his 27th appearance. He didn't play as much as Hoijlund sure but one goal for a team of that ilk isn't anything to write home about.   It's all just pointless because at the end of the day players develop differently. Solanke not doing much for Liverpool has no bearing on his development because some players do better in different systems and managers etc. I just thought dismissing Hoijlund at Atalanta whilst ignoring Solankes time at Liverpool was a shortcoming in your initial points. Bro missed half the conversation but still decided to mix himself into the chat...  That's the entire point, you can present a lot of stats to prove either side of the argument.  However it's still a fact that he scored that many goals in a league campaign.  I mean if you want to compare PL goals compare the season just gone where Hojlund scored 10 in like two months while Solanke scored 19.  Either way you're wrong, Solanke literally scored 29 goals in the league that season. Go join buddy 'I was so far off the mark I quickly deleted my comments' That would make more sense ? Again, Isak scored 21 goals last season, why have you included him? >Bro missed half the conversation but still decided to mix himself into the chat...  Why are u talking like an edgy teenager? Reddit is a public forum   >Either way you're wrong, Solanke literally scored 29 goals in the league that season.  Championship stats literally don't matter.  Comparing efl stats to top flight is plain stupid And he got 10 last season. Solanke scored 6 and 19. Do the extra 6 goals make all the difference? Bro, you literally mixed yourself into a conversation that's half deleted because the other person felt too dumb to leave his comments... Not sure what you're even trying to accomplish here.  >Comparing efl stats to top flight is plain stupid  No shit, I was making a point. Which you clearly missed, not the brightest knife in the cupboard. Factually he still scored 29 league goals that season. > All these different strikers that haven't worked out >Bro, you literally mixed yourself into a conversation that's half deleted because the other person felt too dumb to leave his comments... Not sure what you're even trying to accomplish here.  I read their comments as well, and I still find it stupid to compare championship performances to top flight football   >Factually he still scored 29 league goals that season.  In the championship, then you compare it to Hojlund's CarEeR GoALs foolish comparison Yeah Hojlund played in Austria and Denmark lmao.  >and I still find it stupid to compare championship performances to top flight football   It's almost like I wasn't genuinely comparing... It's amazing how you are failing to understand something so basic. You almost got it and then bottled understanding. Impressive. >It's almost like I wasn't genuinely comparing...  >Hojlund career league goals: 28  >Solanke league goals in 21/22: 29  Lol Oh my days...  Yeah you got me, nothing gets past you lad.  A person makes dumb claims using cherry picked stats. I reply saying you can cherry pick a lot to make a case for any opinion you have, I then proceed to pick out Solanke scoring 29 league goals in a single campaign.  And now here we have the smartest person in the room going 'Hey that stat is cherry picked!!!!'  Yeah well done Sherlock. That's just whataboutism No it's not, you literally don't know the definition of the words you are using.  See you later alligator. Insults don't make you smart, but what do I expect from someone that compares efl goals to ucl goals lmao Yeah mate, I'm sorry I do not have the capacity or the ability to make you understand. Have a good one."
