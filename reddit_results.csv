"[Gary Neville] ''Spurs fans won't like this but if you're Man City losing Pep Guardiola in a year or two, you'd be looking at Ange now thinking, WOW, that's exactly what we want to see. But for the time being Spurs have just got to enjoy this''",2023-12-16T10:12:35+00:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/18jo9pa/gary_neville_spurs_fans_wont_like_this_but_if/,"''What he’s done in such a short period of time is quite staggering,” Neville said.

“He’s put something in place that’s breathtaking to watch but actually, is quite complex when you watch it from a football point of view.”

The former England international went on to say that he believes the former Socceroos boss would be an ideal candidate to replace Guardiola, whose contract expires in the summer of 2025.

“Spurs fans won’t like this but he is amazing, and if you’re Manchester City losing Pep Guardiola in a year or two, you’d be looking at Ange Postecoglou now thinking ‘wow that’s exactly what we want to see’,” Neville said.

“But for the time being Spurs have just got to enjoy this because it’s brilliant to watch''.

“What they can do is enjoy one of the best brands of football I’ve seen in 10 years since I finished playing football. I love watching Tottenham Hotspur play.”

##**13'**| ⚽ Goal! Manchester City 0, Tottenham Hotspur [1]. James Maddison (Tottenham Hotspur)

- GOAL!!! SPURS STRIKE FIRST! It's 1-0 to Tottenham! Kukusevski skins Gvardiol on the right wing, then lofts a lovely cross over to Maddison, who arrives with perfect timing into City's six-yard box. First time, he guides the ball inside the left-hand post, before setting off on his trademark darts celebration! That was totally against the run of play - City trail again!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gy58uq/manchester_city_0_1_tottenham_james_maddison_13/)

##**20'**| ⚽ Goal! Manchester City 0, Tottenham Hotspur 2. James Maddison (Tottenham Hotspur) 

- GOAL!!! TOTTENHAM LEAD BY TWO! Maddison silences the Etihad, scoring for the second time in the opening 20 minutes to put Spurs 2-0 up! City lose the ball deep in their own territory, and Son slips a tidy pass into the England international. He finds the net again, dinking a fine finish over Ederson and into the net!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gy5ebz/manchester_city_0_2_tottenham_james_maddison_20/)


**22'**|
CLOSE! Haaland comes close again, driving into the box and firing in a shot that flashes just over the target! It's wide open at the Etihad, where City are desperately seeking a goal back before half-time.

**38'**|
CLOSE! Spurs escape after making a glaring error, as Porro's headed backpass is easily cut out by a lurking Savinho. The Man City winger then tries to lob Vicario, but the goalkeeper makes a smart stop on the edge of his area!

**45'**|
There will be at least three minutes added to the end of this first half, which has flown by. Spurs are in Man City territory, taking their time on the ball and trying to ensure they keep their two-goal lead intact until half-time.

#🗒️ Match Events

- 1st Half Begins

**1'**|
Liverpool get the match underway from the kick-off!

**10'**|
Guardiola is patrolling his technical area nervously, shouting instructions to his side, who have been on the back foot in the opening 10 minutes at Anfield. Poor passing and sloppy touches have given the hosts multiple opportunities to win the ball back easily, with Diaz and Szoboszlai looking dangerous on the counter.

**11'**|
OFF THE POST AND OUT! Mac Allister and Szoboszlai combine to play a corner-kick short, with the Hungary international clipping a cross to the back post after carrying possession to the edge of the 18-yard box. Van Dijk leaps and throws himself at the delivery but he smashes his header off the frame of the goal!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1h46nhz/virgil_van_dijk_hits_the_post_against_manchester/)

##**12'**| ⚽Goal! Liverpool [1], Manchester City 0. Cody Gakpo (Liverpool)

- THE BALL GOES IN THIS TIME! 1-0 LIVERPOOL! Mac Allister threads a superb pass through the lines towards the corner-flag for Salah, who tracks it down before dribbling into the penalty area ahead of Akanji. Shaping to shoot, the Egypt international instead squares an unselfish, inch-perfect pass across the face of goal for Gakpo, who tucks it home coolly!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1h46nlo/liverpool_1_0_manchester_city_cody_gakpo_12/)

**19'**|
SO CLOSE FOR THE SECOND TIME! Van Dijk is once again able to get his head to the ball freely from a corner-kick, latching on to Mac Allister’s outswinging delivery before pushing the chance inches wide of the post!

**21'**|
Liverpool have registered seven total shots, four on target - and one off the post - while producing an xG of 1.41 in the first 20 minutes. Manchester City, for their part, have zeroes in each category, with Guardiola’s side off to a poor start lacking in confidence.

- 2nd Half Begins!

**46'**|
Manchester City get the match restarted from the kick-off!

**51'**|
WHAT A COUNTER! Kelleher rolls the ball into the feet of Robertson immediately following Manchester City’s corner, with the full-back getting into Manchester City’s half before wrapping a pass around the defensive line for Gakpo, who is denied the opportunity to shoot by a sliding Nunes!

**57'**|
SALAH MISSES THE TARGET! Silva’s pass back to Akanji inside the centre-circle is lept upon by Salah, who immediately drives forward into Manchester City’s penalty area, drawing Ortega off his line. With time and space to pick his spot, the Egypt international uses his left foot to find the far corner, but he sends his effort high and wide!

PENALTY TO LIVERPOOL! Nunez hurries Dias just outside his own 18-yard box after Akanji’s poor header back following a goal-kick, with Diaz storming through to win the ball before breaking into the area and going over under a mistimed Ortega sliding challenge. The Manchester City players are vehemently arguing their case but it’s a clear spot-kick, with Salah given the chance to double Liverpool’s advantage!

##**78'**| ⚽ Goal! Liverpool 2, Manchester City 0. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) 

- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! 2-0 LIVERPOOL! After squandering a chance earlier in the half, Salah makes no mistake from the spot-kick, pulling his low effort towards the near post. Ortega guesses correctly, looking to make amends for his challenge, but he’s unable to deny the winger, who puts the hosts ahead by a pair!

KELLEHER PRESERVES THE ADVANTAGE! Van Dijk inexplicably gives the ball away to De Bruyne 25 yards from goal after a lax touch, but the Belgium international is denied by Kelleher, who manages to smother the eventual shot put through his legs at the second time of asking.

**84'**| 🔄 Substitution, Liverpool. Curtis Jones replaces Mohamed Salah.

- Salah gets six extra minutes to rest his legs, with Jones brought on in his stead.

#🗒️ Match Events

- 1st Half Begins!

**1'**|
We're under way!

**3'**|
City with the early possession here as you might expect keeping it well in the middle of the pitch as Brighton get everyone back the ball to soak it up.

**5'**|
Almost! Haaland makes a good run in behind the Brighton defence, with Gundogan trying to slide the ball through to him, but it's cut out in the nick of time.


**13'**|
Not too far away! Lewis switches the ball across to the right to Savinho, who tries to pick out Haaland with a cross with his weaker foot, but his curling strike ends up landing on the top of the net.

**16'**|
CHANCE! Savinho should score! The winger cuts in from the right wing and Kovacic plays the ball in behind the Brighton defence for Savinho, who only has Verbruggen to beat from a tight angle. However, the keeper gets down quickly and makes a great save with his feet to deny him his first City goal.


**17'**|
CHANCE! Haaland should do better! Foden whips an excellent free-kick delivery into the box and it evades the Brighton defence, allowing Haaland a free shot on goal at the far post. However, the striker is reaching for it and can't turn his effort goalwards.

**19'**| 🟨
Yasin Ayari (Brighton and Hove Albion) is shown the yellow card


##**23'**| ⚽ Goal! Brighton and Hove Albion 0, Manchester City [1]. Erling Haaland (Manchester City) 

- GOAL! CITY LEAD! Brighton lose possession in midfield and City punish them on the counter-attack. Kovavic does brilliantly to slide the ball through the Brighton defence and Haaland finds space between the two centre-backs and drives towards goal. He fires a low shot towards goal which Verbruggen manages to get a touch to, but it still flies towards the back of the net and Haaland reaches it ahead of Van Hecke, poking it in from close range. They lead 1-0!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gnfpnx/brighton_0_1_manchester_city_erling_haaland_23/)

**26'**|
OFF THE POST! Haaland almost makes it two! It's another quick counter by City, with Foden finding Haaland deep in the box, who fires an effort towards the near post. Verbruggen gets a touch on it with his feet, which sends it onto the post and out for a corner.


**30'**|
We're at the half an hour mark now and it's City who lead 1-0 thanks to Haaland's 12th Premier League goal of the season.

**37'**| 🟨
Rico Lewis (Manchester City) is shown the yellow card

**44'**| 🟨
Igor Julio (Brighton and Hove Albion) is shown the yellow card.

- 1st Half Ends!

- 2nd Half Begins!

**45'**|
The second half is under way!

**45'**| Substitution, Brighton and Hove Albion. Carlos Baleba replaces Yasin Ayari.

**50'**|
Decent chance! Mitoma is found in plenty of space with a cross from the right and he should take a touch and try and fire a shot away, but instead heads it back across goal for a teammate. However, it lacks power and Ederson comfortably gathers.

**52'**|
CHANCE! Estupinan delivers an excellent cross into the penalty area from the left wing and it's met by the head of Hinshelwood, who powers a header towards goal. However, it's too close to Ederson, who makes a good save to deny Brighton the equaliser.

**55'**|
A second goal would make it difficult for Brighton to get back into this one and a win for City today would send them top of the table.

**57'**| 🔄
Substitution, Brighton and Hove Albion. Matt O'Riley replaces Jack Hinshelwood due to an injury.


**60'**| Welbeck has either scored (3) or assisted (1) a goal in each of his last four Premier League games – he’s never registered a goal involvement in five consecutive matches in the competition before.

**61'**|
City seem to have seen off the early Brighton storm here and are now seeing much more of the ball and are pushing forward themselves.

**65'**|
Good chance! Estupinan whips another good cross into the box from the left and it's met by Rutter, who has a free header at goal, but he gets too much on it and it fiies over the crossbar.

**66'**| 🔄
Substitution, Brighton and Hove Albion. Brajan Gruda replaces Georginio Rutter.

**66'**| 🔄
Substitution, Brighton and Hove Albion. João Pedro replaces Simon Adingra.


**68'**|
CHANCE! City lose possession deep inside their own half and Mitoma is fed through on goal, but Ederson races out to meet him and makes a terrific save to deny Brighton the equaliser.

**69'**|
CHANCE! Joao Pedro now with the opportunity in front of goal, he only has Ederson to beat, but Walker gets back just in time to put him off and the shot flies well wide of the City goal.

**72'**| 🔄
Substitution, Manchester City. Bernardo Silva replaces Ilkay Gündogan.

**74'**| 🔄
Substitution, Manchester City. Kevin De Bruyne replaces Savinho.

- Another City change, as Savinho heads off and he's been replaced by De Bruyne, who makes his return to the side after a spell on the sidelines.

**77'**| 🟨
Jahmai Simpson-Pusey (Manchester City) is shown the yellow card

##**78'**| ⚽ Goal! Brighton and Hove Albion [1], Manchester City 1. João Pedro

- GOAL! BRIGHTON EQUALISE! The initial cross comes in from Mitoma, which City fail to deal with, Welbeck can’t get a shot away and then it’s very scrappy deep inside the box, with City unable to clear the ball. Joao Pedro then nicks it off everyone and fires it into the back of the net from close range, it’s 1-1!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gnhdde/brighton_1_1_manchester_city_joao_pedro_78/)

##**83'**| ⚽ Goal! Brighton and Hove Albion [2], Manchester City 1. Matt O'Riley (Brighton and Hove Albion) 

- GOAL! BRIGHTON LEAD! They’ve turned it around! It’s a lovely move by Brighton, playing quick football and they open City up, with Welbeck laying it off to Joao Pedro, who then slides the ball through to O’Riley, who takes a touch and then beat Ederson to fire it into the back of the net! Brighton lead 2-1!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gnhiuh/brighton_2_1_manchester_city_m_oriley_83/)

**85'**| 
O'Riley and Joao Pedro have been on the sidelines for a while for Brighton, but they've made their mark upon their return to the team!


**90'**| 🔄
Substitution, Brighton and Hove Albion. Jakub Moder replaces Kaoru Mitoma.

- 2nd Half Ends!

#🗒️ Match Events

- 1st Half Begins!

**1'**|
Manchester City get the match underway from the kick-off!


**2'**|
Rodri has gone down holding his head immediately after the kick-off, with less than five seconds passing before the incident. Both sets of players crowd around the Spain international, after what appeared to be a raised elbow from Havertz.

**3'**|
After a check from the medical staff, Rodri is cleared to continue, while VAR looks at every angle of the incident. It doesn’t appear a card will be produced for Havertz, as the game restarts from a free-kick.

**8'**|
GUNDOGAN GOES WIDE! Akanji hits a switch out to the right for Silva, who immediately plays an incisive pass into the penalty area for Gundogan. The midfielder takes a sensational touch to flick the ball over the head of Gabriel, but he skews his volley wide of the post from 10 yards out!

##**9'**| ⚽ Goal! Manchester City 1, Arsenal 0. Erling Haaland (Manchester City).

- THE HOSTS STRIKE FIRST! 1-0! It’s a 100th Manchester City goal for Haaland, who finds the back of the net for an incredible 10th time this season. Savinho cuts inside ahead of Calafiori after linking up with Walker and plays an inch-perfect pass into the channel for the Norway international, who beats both Gabriel and Saliba for pace before knocking a low shot past Raya with the outside of his foot! Savinho's perfectly weighted pass is the assist for Haaland's go-ahead goal; the second of the season for the former Girona winger.

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fmw6m8/manchester_city_1_0_arsenal_erling_haaland_9/)

**14'**|
DENIED BY THE POST! Gundogan and Savinho stand over the deadball but it’s the former who takes it, using his right foot to curl his effort towards a gap at the near post. It’s a clever attempt that forces Raya diving across his line but Manchester City are denied by the frame of the goal, which keeps it 1-0.


**21'**| 🔄
Substitution, Manchester City. Mateo Kovacic replaces Rodri because of an injury.

##**22'**| ⚽ Goal! Manchester City 1, Arsenal [1]. Riccardo Calafiori (Arsenal).

- SIMPLY SUBLIME FROM CALAFIORI! 1-1! Arsenal restart play quickly from a free-kick, with the ball floated out to the left for Martinelli. The Brazil international drives towards the byline before laying it off to Calafiori, whose first-time left-footed strike nestles beautifully into the top corner!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fmwh7e/manchester_city_1_1_arsenal_riccardo_calafiori_22/)


**23'**| 🟨
Ederson (Manchester City) is shown the yellow card.

**33'**|
The rain has started to come down at the Etihad, with the pitch becoming more and more slick as time wears on. It will force the goalkeepers to take less risks when in possession and during parrying attempts, as the slippery ball could easily slip through a pair of gloves.

**34'**| 🟨
Leandro Trossard (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card

**42'**|
CHANCE! Martinelli again threatens down the left wing, driving towards the byline ahead of Walker before pulling a bouncing pass back towards the penalty spot. Trossard manages to get there just ahead of Dias but he can’t find the target, sending his snatched effort high and wide.

**44'**|
Arsenal earned four points against Manchester City in the Premier League last season, double the amount they had from their previous 15 such meetings with the Citizens (two draws and 13 losses).

**45'**| 6mins of injury time added

##**45'+1'**| ⚽ Goal! Manchester City 1, Arsenal [2]. Gabriel Magalhães (Arsenal).

- DEFICIT OVERTURNED! 2-1 ARSENAL! Saka whips a powerful inswinging corner to the back post, where again Gabriel is able to get over the back of Gvardiol. This time, however, the centre-back doesn’t miss the target, sending his effort right into the top corner!

- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fmx0na/manchester_city_1_2_arsenal_gabriel_magalhaes_451/)


**45'+3'**| 🟨
Rúben Dias (Manchester City) is shown the yellow card 

**45'+7'**| 🟨
Thomas Partey (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card

**45'+8'**| 🟥
Second yellow card to Leandro Trossard (Arsenal).

- Trossard gives the ball away in midfield, leading to a late Manchester City counter-attack. Savinho looks to break into Arsenal’s half but he’s abruptly stopped by a sliding Partey challenge - for which he’s shown a yellow card.

- TROSSARD SENT OFF! SECOND YELLOW! It’s a second booking in 19 minutes for Trossard, who charges through the back of Silva during an aerial duel right in front of the referee. There is no attempt to try and win the ball from the Belgium international, who has left his side down to 10 men for the final 45 minutes!

- 2nd Half Begins



**45'**| 🔄
Substitution, Arsenal. Ben White replaces Bukayo Saka.

**45'**|
Arsenal get the match restarted from the kick-off!

**46'**| Looking to shore things up, Saka is replaced by White, with Arsenal moving to a 5-3-1 in the absence of Trossard.

**55'**|
Arsenal are denying Manchester City any space whatsoever ahead of their own penalty area, with all nine outfield players camped within 20 yards of Raya. The hosts look more comfortable playing down the wings before centring the ball into the 18-yard box instead of using incision through the middle, which could mean the introduction of either Foden or Grealish to help pick the lock.

**59'**|
FANTASTIC SAVE FROM RAYA! The hosts work a short-corner routine from the right, which leads to a Walker cross to the far post for Haaland. The Norway international manages to leap high above Saliba and send a dangerous, bouncing header towards the goal but Raya somehow manages to scoop it clear despite the conditions, before Silva blazes the follow-up effort over the crossbar!


**61'**|
Arsenal have managed 13 total passes in the second half, compared to Manchester City’s 138. The Gunners are seeing less than 10 per cent possession as they are pinned in their own defensive-third of the pitch, with no outlet ball to help relieve the pressure.

**62'**|
GOOD SAVE! Timber manages to nod away the initial danger at the near post following a Manchester City corner, but Partey is caught in possession inside his own penalty area, which gives Gvardiol a chance to test the goalkeeper. The left-back hits a venomous, low strike that Raya gets down quickly to block, before quickly rising to his feet to catch the ball at the second attempt.



**65'**| 🟨
Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card.

- Lewis-Skelly has had something to say to the referee during Raya's stretch, which prompts Michael Oliver to show the substitute a yellow card. It's the first booking of Lewis-Skelly's career - before he's made his Premier League debut.

**69'**|
Manchester City have just over 20 minutes to find something from this match, or Arsenal will end matchweek five as Premier League leaders. Guardiola’s side have fired 11 total shots on 90 per cent possession and manufactured an xG of 0.47 in the second half, but have not been able to beat Raya. A first substitution of the game is incoming for the hosts, who are looking to ask different questions of the Gunners’ defense.

**70'**| 🔄
Substitution, Manchester City. Phil Foden replaces Jérémy Doku.

**74'**| 🔄
Substitution, Arsenal. Jakub Kiwior replaces Riccardo Calafiori because of an injury.

**78'**| 🔄
Substitution, Manchester City. Jack Grealish replaces Savinho.

**78'**| 🔄
Substitution, Manchester City. John Stones replaces Kyle Walker.

**83'**| 🟨
Declan Rice (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card.

**87'**| 🔄
Substitution, Arsenal. Gabriel Jesus replaces Gabriel Martinelli.

**89'**|
Raya has made 6 saves, his highest total in a single match in the Premier League. In stark contrast - Ederson has not made a single one in Manchester City’s goal.

**90'**| 7 mins of injury time added

**90'+1'**| 🟨
Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) is shown the yellow card.

**90'+2'**| 🔄
Substitution, Arsenal. Myles Lewis-Skelly replaces Jurriën Timber because of an injury.

**90'+6'**| 🟨
Gabriel Jesus (Arsenal) is shown the yellow card.

##**90'+8'**| ⚽ Goal! Manchester City 2, Arsenal 2. John Stones (Manchester City) 

- STONES WITH POTENTIALLY THE LAST KICK OF THE GAME! 2-2! Grealish and Gundogan work a short-corner routine that gives the winger a chance to break into Arsenal’s penalty area, before cutting a pass back to Kovacic. The Croatia international’s shot is deflected rather fortunately by the diving Kiwior, giving Stones the chance to tuck the ball into an empty net!


- [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1fmyum6/manchester_city_2_2_arsenal_john_stones_908/)

**90+10'**|
It’s all kicked off between the players on the pitch and the coaches in the technical area, with Arsenal furious to have lost their lead in the eighth minute of stoppage time. The result puts Manchester City back on the top of the table should it hold, while Arsenal sit fourth.
